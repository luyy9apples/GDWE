for the blinkandyou llmissit role of a train conductor in its upcoming race to witch mountain , walt disney pictures looked to an unusual talent the chairman of the studio yes , making his bigscreen debut on friday is none other than disney top dog dick cook mr cook , known for his folksy personality , started his career at the company in 1970 as a monorail and steam locomotive driver at disneyland so race director andy fickman thought it would be a funny inside joke to put mr cook in the film as the operator of a freight train that crashes in spectacular fashion after getting caught in alien crossfire the fate of mr cook s character is left up in the air , something that concerned at least one eagleeyed boy in a test screening , mr fickman said this kid piped up and wanted to know what happened to that really nice train conductor man , which i thought was adorable , he said mr cook declined to comment but mr fickman clearly enjoyed the experience there s nothing like directing a guy who could end your career on the spot , he said he jokingly added , he was a pleasure to work with , though except for the drinking
with steroidaided endurance less a factor than in the past , the winner of the 135th kentucky derby is likely to be a horse bred to still be running strong at the end of the mile and quarter distance five of the nine winners so far this decade were bred to win the derby streets sense , barbaro , giacomo , monarchos and fusaichi pegasus and four were not war emblem , funny cide , smarty jones and big brown but in many of those years , many of the early favorites and eventual starters got there on steroids , speed genes and stakes earnings from short races as 2yearolds usually under the twin spires on the first saturday in may , only three or four horses were still running in the last 400 yards this year the field is full of horses bred to win the classics , even long shots of questionable qualifications , dubious connections and light credentials and for the first time in several years none of the favorites will have to depend on chemicalinduced staying power to keep from staggering and gasping for breath at the sixteenth pole most horses bred or bought and aimed at the derby in the last 15 years have depended on the genes of mr prospector and storm cat to get them there , despite the obvious inability of these famous sires to produce winners of stakes races longer than a mile and an eighth but a few of their sons are clearly better at it , notably the fappiano and street cry lines of mr prospector , and storm cat s son giant s causeway , all three of whom have descendants among the favorites in this year s run for the roses dunkirk and pioneerof the nile , both sired by grandsons of fappiano , are on almost everyone s top five lists and rank among the most regally bred and most expensive horses in the race and each inherits stamina from what some breeders , myself included , believe to be the most important source their dams a 37 million yearling , dunkirk was sired by unbridled s song , known more as a sire of speed than stamina , but dunkirk is out of the ap indy mare , secret status , who carries the blood of the unquestioned stayers seattle slew and alydar bigstriding pioneerof the nile , who looks like he can run all day , is by the belmont winner empire maker \( perhaps the best horse that should have won the derby but didn t \) , and got an added dose of distance breeding from the lord at war mare , star of goshen  the solid closer hold me back , by giant s causeway , might have the best chance of any storm cat descendant since cat thief , who finished third in the 1999 derby and got distance help from his alydar dam although beaten by general quarters in the bluegrass at keeneland in april , hold me back was closing fast and had plenty left at the end of the mile and an eighth his dam is by unbridled s song , who so far appears to be passing along the distance capabilities of fappiano through his daughters more often than to his sons the unbridled s song fillies octave and eight belles , who finished second in the derby last year , have shown more affinity for a route of ground than the boys , who tend to be speed merchants who run out of steam among the other top tier horses in the minds of wiseguy railbirds are the two likely betting favorites when the gates open friesan fire and i want revenge each boasting stamina genes on both sides of the pedigree ap indy , the best son of seattle slew , is the sire of both friesan fire and stephen got even , who sired i want revenge the dams of both are laden with staying power as well friesan fire gets his from deputy minister through a dehere dam , which is the same cross as rags to riches , the champion filly that outgutted curlin in the belmont at the end of a mile and a half i want revenge inherits from fappiano himself through his son roy , a proven source of stamina in the southern hemisphere the buzz horse among the speed sheet aficionados , the weirdos who appear to draw their conclusions from a combination of slide rule data and voodoo , is desert party , the laterunning half of the dubai entry a son of street cry , the only other mr prospector line proving it can excel at the classic distances , desert party gets help on the broodmare side from sir gaylord , halfbrother to secretariat both are sons of somethingroyal , a proven endurance well surprisingly , a larger group of horses being given less respect by the professional handicappers , is flush with deep closers and lovely pedigrees chief among them in my book is the longshot mr hot stuff by tiznow and out of an alydar line mare , he is a full brother to colonel john , who loved the dirt at churchill and had no trouble getting the distance there are also two sons of birdstone , who ran down smarty jones in the belmont and whose sire grindstone , won the derby himself the mares on both sides of mine that bird and summer bird can contribute when that last sixteenth of mile looms before them summer bird s dam carries the blood of secretariat , alydar and nijinsky ii , and mine that bird is slightly less blessed , although she is a daughter of smart strike , the sire of curlin smart strike is also the sire of papa clem , the arkansas derby winner whose dam can contribute the stamina genes of somethingroyal and the female family of affimed s sire , exclusive native and how can anyone discount the candy ride entry , chocolate candy , who has fappiano on top and seattle slew and alydar on the bottom \? if there is one horse in 20 whose pedigree ought to disqualify it as a potential winner , it is musket man , a son of the sprinter yonaguska and minus much stamina blood up on the dam side but he won the mileandaneighth illinois derby on dirt and finished like he was looking for more ground at the wire so go figure two of the starters , general quarters and join in the dance , are by hot young sire , sky mesa , who is among the best pedigreed horses in the stud book by ap indy s son , pulpit , sky mesa is out of a mare carrying the blood of both storm cat and affirmed general quarters has fappiano and round table on the bottom side , and join in the dance has halo and buckpasser , all four known for passing on endurance from even a picky breeder s perspective nearly twothirds of the field have the blood to contest the world s greatest race and it is almost impossible to separate the top six in a pedigree sweepstakes so i am going with the most accomplished horses and the connections most likely to get it done my super pedigree superfecta box in order of preference is friesan fire , pioneerof the nile , i want revenge and chocolate candy now that win willy is out , my longshot is mr big stuff , and my rooting interest is general quarters because he is the least expensive , blueblooded horse in the race
washington with a course that winds more than 2 , 000 miles through italy , up snowcovered mountains and down steep , snaking roads , the giro d'italia italy s renowned 21day cycling race is one of the world s most grueling sporting events but angelo zomegnan , the race director , is out to make it even harder a maestro of marketing , zomegnan is the driving force behind bringing the first two stages of the giro to the streets of washington in 2012 he said the project would cost about 5 million some critics say starting the race in the united states is unrealistic too expensive , too much of a hassle and too punishing for the riders , who would have to deal with jet lag others say it is nonsensical , comparing it to hosting the middle two games of the world series overseas is it crazy \? oh sure , yes , i 've heard that , zomegnan said last week before meeting with washington s mayor , , to discuss race plans but i think it is good to take chances i do n't say , why i say , why not \? zomegnan , a former journalist , has taken chances to garner more attention for the giro , with mixed results at the 2009 giro in may , the race s 100th anniversary , he designed a spectacular , madefortelevision course so demanding that some riders including the seventime winner lance armstrong  zomegnan all but called them wimps , saying they may be getting too old and no longer want to race in tough situations the riders were angered , but the race garnered more spectators and a larger television audience than ever bringing in extreme events brings more publicity for the sport , but he goes a little too far in creating a spectacle and he neglects the sporting element and the safety of the riders , pat mcquaid , the president of the international cycling union , said last week , adding that he had warned zomegnan to keep the riders' safety in mind i understand his position of trying to create public interest , but this ca n't go on , mcquaid said if the giro idea becomes realistic , we would definitely have a say in the structure of the race we would make sure to protect the riders mcquaid said that the priority for the cycling union would be for the riders to have enough time to overcome their jet lag he said at least two to three days of rest in italy would be necessary before the race continued zomegnan said one or two days would suffice normal people have jet lag , zomegnan said normal people ca n't run three weeks and 3 , 500 kilometers the riders are n't normal people still , the project is going forward mark sommers , a lawyer who is head of the group working to bring the race to washington , said the city and giro organizers had a tentative agreement over the next several weeks , giro officials will speak to tourism , safety and city officials to complete details the proposed course for both stages would remain inside the city , passing buildings and monuments that have a link to italy , sommers said one of those sites includes the memorial bridge , which connects virginia and washington the statues at one end were gifts from italy to the united states in 1950 angelo does n't want the race to be italiancentric he s more universal than that , sommers said he has a larger mission to build the brand and the sport outside of europe he s inventive you 've got to love that that feat of holding two giro stages in washington would be a logistical marvel , requiring 198 riders and several hundred giro and team staff to fly eight hours and traverse five time zones before the race resumes on italian soil , in rome the bicycles , each worth thousands of dollars , would ride along other sports have already accomplished something similar , to different degrees major league baseball has played regularseason games in japan , and the nhl has done so in europe the nfl has played regularseason games in london but none of those sports are quite like the giro , one of cycling s three grand tours races that require riders to have nearly superhuman resilience as they endure physical pain day after day for three weeks it is a triumph just to make it to the finish none of the grand tours , which include the tour de france and the vuelta a espa a , have ever started outside europe but several times , tour organizers have toyed with the idea in the 1980s , a new york start for the tour was considered , but dropped because there were not enough concordes to fly the riders back to france in 2008 , a start in quebec city would have been part of the city s 400th anniversary , but tour organizers balked it would be like asking the formula one people to hold their time trials in canada and then having the grand prix race run in europe , the tour official jeanfran ois pescheux told la presse , a newspaper in montreal , during those negotiations the idea has been studied , the potential is there , everything is there , but we ca n't allow it zomegnan , however , says he does not see any problems with his plan he tried to bring the race s start to new york for the giro s anniversary , but decided against it because of the lagging economy he then began working with robin morton , who runs an event planning and production company in new jersey , to try again they ended up in washington there s so many events that come to the city of new york , whether it s sporting events or global functions , i guess new york did n't want to pursue our plan , said morton , who was the manager of the 1984 giannimotta team , the first americanbased team at the giro but mayor fenty is a big cycling fan , and the city is also trying to raise its profile it was a good fit some riders , including the garmintransitions team leader christian vande velde , say the plan not only is feasible , but it may also be fun i think if you are intelligent about the whole matter and are civil to the riders , it would be beautiful and really cool , and it would bring a lot of recognition for our sport , vande velde said it s a crazy idea , but it could work but , of course , there s a fine line between crazy stupid and crazy spectacular , he added i'm supportive of it , within reason
los angeles one photograph was taken on a patch that passed for a basketball court in yaound , cameroon the other was shot under the lights at the rca dome in indianapolis both show alfred aboya soaring for a dunk and both of them , taken several years apart , still come up when aboya s coaches map his odyssey the first picture became aboya s ticket to the united states it was virtually the only thing scott willard , the former boys basketball coach at the , had when he recruited him in 2003 the second , from the 2006 ncaa championship game , showed just how far aboya had come much farther than the 13 , 000 miles between here and yaound he had that was freakish , ucla coach ben howland said it was over joakim noah , and he was so high you can see bill russell in the background with his mouth agape now , as aboya s college basketball career approaches its end with his fourth pacific10 tournament and his fourth trip to the ncaa tournament , his journey is not nearly over he earned his bachelor s degree in three years and is working on a master s in public policy at ucla he plans to return to his homeland someday for a career in politics i owe everything to basketball , aboya said recently in his native french without basketball , i would n't be here i probably would n't even have gone to college and it s thanks to basketball that i can live out my dreams it began with an envelope that landed on willard s desk at tilton six years ago at the time the prep school was looking to expand its international student population and was developing an english as a second language program tilton had never had a student from africa suddenly , here was a file from a student who spoke a couple of languages , none of them english , and who excelled in two sports , one of them basketball and there was the photograph to prove it so willard took a chance though aboya had already graduated from high school in cameroon , he saw a path to an american university education if it meant two years of prep school first , it was a sacrifice worth making what willard got was a tremendous athlete who pushed himself as hard in the classroom as he did on the court but as quickly as he picked up english , some of the finer points of basketball strategy required more time he was very , very raw , said willard , who is now the director of basketball at the university of wyoming so his first year , we made it a rule that he had to stick to the paint by his senior year , aboya had become a dominant center , attracting attention from colleges like georgetown and ucla and it was on his visit to the west coast , nine time zones from home , that aboya made friends with luc richard mbah a moute , who grew up minutes away from him in yaound once they arrived here in the fall of 2005 , they relied on each other far more than teammates and roommates normally do they became each other s support network we had to be each other s parents , brothers and best friends , aboya said meanwhile , aboya felt as if he had fallen two years behind during his time in prep school as soon as possible , he sat down with his academic adviser to build a schedule to graduate in three years it was a schedule of study , practice , study , rinse and repeat it was a work ethic that made him an instant leader in howland s eyes people asked me if i drank coffee all the time or did other stuff , aboya said but i told them that when you 're mentally prepared to accomplish something , it s easier to get through it he collected his undergraduate degree last spring with a grade point average better than 30 in international relations and began work on his master s in the fall , without his standin family of one around mbah a moute was drafted by the milwaukee bucks last year if he has the chance to follow mbah a moute into the nba , aboya said , he might postpone the final semesters of his master s to give the professional game a shot his 101 points and 6 rebounds a game have him on a few nba radars , though certainly not as a high pick but despite the best numbers of his career , this season will most likely go down as aboya s least successful one here he has played in three straight final fours still , it may be his most poignant season for the first time since he came to the united states , he was able to look into the stands and see his parents they flew from cameroon to attend ucla s game thursday against oregon state and the team s senior night on saturday they have remained here for the pac10 tournament the trip to that game at pauley pavilion took his parents nearly 24 hours it took their son six years
the problem in starting a concert with a familiar overture is that if the overture is performed persuasively , what you may want to hear next is the rest of the opera , not other , unrelated music so after edward gardner and the mostly mozart festival orchestra s taut account of s zauberfl te overture at avery fisher hall on friday evening , you halfwanted tamino to trip onto the stage with a monstrous snake in pursuit instead piotr anderszewski came on to play mozart s piano concerto no 18 in b flat no bad thing , to be sure still , a listener primed for opera kept hearing it in the melting woodwind harmonies of the opening movement s subsidiary theme , in the longbreathed sighs of the second movement as familiar as that 1784 concerto and its ties to mozart s nozze di figaro , begun a year later , have become , mr gardner an opera specialist and the music director of the english national opera brought those ties to vibrant life , summoning the concrete mood and palpable atmosphere of opera in those lightly anguished opening phrases of the second movement we seemed to find ourselves in an unimaginable place the workshop of mozart s mind as he was conceiving the cavatina that begins the opera s fourth act , barbarina s magnificent little lament over her lost pin the repeated rhythm two separated 8th notes followed by a stressed 8th leaning into an abrupt 16th suggested words barbarina , cavatina , poverina \( as in poor thing \) as silly as it would be to suggest that mozart was thinking any such thing , and those certainly were n't the words he set , it is equally hard to believe that something of the opera was n't already beginning to brew in his imagination mr gardner certainly set one listener s mind and ears aswirl none of this detracted from the excellent work of mr anderszewski , whose fine sensitivity seemed well attuned to mr gardner s despite his introverted manner the solo line emerged in a limpid stream , deftly shifting pace and direction over the musical bedrock for anyone who has grappled with mozart at the piano , it could only be frustrating to observe how easy mr anderszewski made it all look mr gardner and the orchestra gave a lovely account of mozart s symphony no 39 in e flat though the least performed of the three symphonies \( with nos 40 and 41 \) from the astounding summer of 1788 , it has been no stranger to the over the decades the remaining work , centuries removed , was by benjamin britten , who often demonstrated an affinity for mozart , not only in some of his compositions but also in his performances as pianist and conductor he was represented here by the serenade for tenor , horn and strings , which in this context should perhaps have been subtitled a lot of night music the work written for britten s companion , the tenor peter pears , and the horn player dennis brain sets poems about night by tennyson , blake , keats and others in a variety of styles , not hesitating to push the vocalist high the tenor here , toby spence , maintained an attractive tone throughout his range , often haunting at the top , and projected the text perhaps as well as could be expected in a large hall lawrence dibello , the orchestra s principal horn player , was also expressive in a demanding part that in the prologue and epilogue confined him to naturalhorn technique , with all the acidity that necessarily entails on pitches remote from the valveless instrument s overtone series clairemarie le guay , a french pianist , set the stage for mozartean drama in a preconcert recital on friday with a compelling performance of the great c minor sonata \( k 457 \) it was so compelling that it persuaded at least one listener to attend ms le guay s latenight concert in the festival s little night music series in the kaplan penthouse at lincoln center on saturday ms le guay , who has made recordings pairing mozart with haydn , here played haydn s sonata in e flat \( hob xvi 49 \) and mozart s sonata in b flat \( k 333 \) , hardly inconsiderable works though not remotely on a par with mozart s c minor her performances , clearly involved , were attractive , but not until her encore , the second of liszt s two legends , st francis de paul walking on the waves \( 1863 \) , did she convey real , pulsing life the billowing harmonies of this wildly virtuosic creation seemed a world away from what had come before the skeletal structures of the haydn in particular and it was good to hear a previously buttonedup ms le guay conjure them in such profusion
the historical legacy of 1989 , when the berlin wall fell and the cold war thawed , is as political as the upheavals of that decisive year the events of 1989 spurred a striking transformation of europe , which is now whole and free , and a reunified germany , milestones that are being observed with celebrations all over the continent , including a frenchgerman extravaganza monday evening on the place de la concorde but 1989 also created new divisions and fierce nationalisms that hobble the european union today , between east and west , france and germany , europe and russia some of the intensity of those divisions is evident in the tug of war , in both europe and the united states , over the achievements of 1989 whether they owe more to the resolute anticommunism of ronald reagan or its inverse , the whiteglove embrace of the east by many in western europe and while many in the west saw the wheel of history spinning inevitably , causing the rise of democracy and banishing serious rivals to american power , china forestalled its own revolution in 1989 and catapulted itself to prominence through an authoritarian capitalism that the leaders of russia are now studying the chinese ended up with a leninist capitalism , which none of us imagined in 1989 , and which is now the main ideological competitor to western liberal democracy , said timothy garton ash , a chronicler of 1989 in his book the magic lantern it is a tribute to 1989 , not unlike the french revolution 200 years before it , that its meaning is hotly contested different groups in different countries see the anniversary differently , usually from their own ideological points of view in general , said james m goldgeier of george washington university , a historian of the period , the big question out there for 20 years is who gets the credit for many in the united states , he said , most of the credit now goes to president ronald reagan and his aggressive military spending and antagonism toward communism that view has largely eclipsed another american perspective , which was that globalization and democratization were so powerful that a mikhail gorbachev was inevitable , and that the cold war ended through soft power propaganda , diplomacy and the helsinki accords as the partisan divide over reagan has dissipated , i think over time most americans , if they think back at all , say it was reagan who said , 'tear down this wall , ' and down it came , professor goldgeier said robert kagan , a historian with the carnegie endowment in washington and an editor of the weekly standard , said conservatives won the debate the standard narrative is reagan , he said this is not the case in europe , mr kagan said if 90 percent of americans say it was the us being firm , 99 percent of europeans think it was they being soft that the wall fell through ostpolitik and west german tv for many americans of both political parties , 1989 seemed a wonderful example of the embrace of universal values that happened to be theirs , and some believed it was only a matter of time before all dictatorships crumbled before the same forces of strength , openness , economic liberalism and people power democrats argue that president george w bush learned the wrong lesson from 1989 , about the utility of force , and republicans argue that president bill clinton and president obama learned the wrong lesson that engagement with totalitarian power , whether in china or iran , will weaken or destroy it for all the disagreements , however , said ronald d asmus , a deputy assistant secretary of state for europe in the clinton administration and brussels director of the german marshall fund , what happened was simply amazing if someone asked me in '89 if we would have all these countries in nato and the european union , i would have been incredulous , mr asmus said we 've lost sight of an incredible historical achievement the heart of central and eastern europe is at peace all problems are not fully solved , but they are tempered , controlled and contained , and we have a better chance of solving them even the brief war last year between georgia and russia would have been very different without nato , mr asmus argued these are not existential issues anymore , he said they 're not presidential problems , but assistant secretary of state problems russia remains a challenge for both the united states and europe , but a much safer one , argues sergei karaganov , who leads the council for foreign and defense policy in moscow and was an adviser to the russian presidents boris n yeltsin and vladimir v putin in russia , mr gorbachev , the last soviet president , is widely despised for indecisiveness and for permitting the collapse of the empire , an event that mr putin called the greatest geostrategic catastrophe of the last century not all russians agree , but many do argue that the end of the warsaw pact should have led to the disbanding of nato , or at least a decision not to expand the alliance to include states that were once part of the soviet union
the readers got it right a year ago today , the giants traded jeremy shockey to the saints for draft picks shockey had a lot of supporters among giants fans , and the trade was controversial we asked readers for their opinions here was a representative sample , from pjvermont shockey 1 oft injured 2 average hands 3 stupid penalties 4 average good blocker 5 locker room distraction 6 they won without him 7 in eli s face 8 improvises routes 9 big contract boss has nearly as much physical talent as shockey , and they won with him it s a good trade the wisdom of the crowd said the giants were better off without shockey \( you can go directly to the reader comments here \) the 2008 numbers say shockey 50 catches for 483 yards , a 97yard average boss 33 catches for 384 yards , an 116 average you might think shockey had the advantage but boss had six touchdown receptions to shockey s none and shockey couldn t stay healthy again and proved to be a distraction about 10 , 000 fantasy football players couldn t have been wrong it was probably shockey s worst season a headline from the timespicayune new orleans saints jeremy shockey has drew brees throwing fits excerpt as drew brees frantically and futilely tried to pass the saints back into contention against the falcons on sunday , jeremy shockey , the club s highprofile offseason acquisition , found himself in a strange and decidedly lowprofile place on the sideline in the desperate fourthquarter finish , brees completed a remarkable 19 passes for 294 yards and two touchdowns none of them was to shockey facing thirdand10 from the saints 37yard line and still within two touchdowns , shockey failed to pick up a rushing falcons defender , forcing brees to unload a quick dumpoff pass to him in the left flat to avoid a sack not only did shockey miss the block , he missed the ball , dropping it with a halfhearted effort that spurred brees to sprint toward him and emotionally voice his frustration the animated discussion continued on the saints sideline in the offseason , shockey passed out around 2 am at a pool party in las vegas and had to be taken to a hospital in the offseason , boss put in his typical solid effort and was praised by the former giants tight end star mark bavaro \( via the starledger \)  he has a natural feel for the position jeremy shockey was kind of like a bull charging through a china shop , but kevin meanders his way around through open spaces he doesn t draw a lot of attention to himself , which is an asset as a tight end because you want to sneak up on people plus , he has great , soft hands extra point can anyone answer the question whom did the giants pick with the choices netted in the shockey trade \? you were correct if you said linebacker clint sintim in the second round and quarterback rhett bomar in the fifth extra point ii does boss need to play a bigger role in the offense this season \?
nearly all my traveling was by car when i was a youth my family drove around the country every summer in the iconic family station wagon now it s a different story i practically live in a plane i know that i should put together a checklist of things to pack , but i ca n't bring myself to do so of course , i always forget something usually , it s a minor item , but on one business trip to australia , i forgot to pack pants i 've had my share of surreal travel experiences in 1991 , i was headed to australia , with my soontobe wife as we flew from new york to los angeles , the first persian gulf war broke out the flights attendants were whispering , and onboard communications was shut off then in 2005 , i was taking a trip to israel with my family the battle with hezbollah on the northern borders began just before we were set to depart our travel guide already was in tel aviv , and he encouraged us to stick to our plans we found out later that nearly all other travel groups going to israel had canceled our group was treated like royalty by the locals for maintaining our travel plans the agenda changed considerably due to the war , but the experience still was incredible the strangest experience occurred this year i flew to new york from jacksonville , fla , on saturday , jan 10 my original return ticket was for saturday , jan 17 at that time , i was looking for work , and i received a call during the week to see if i was available for a job interview back in florida on friday , jan 16 i said yes , and booked a new return flight on usair 1549 for thursday , jan 15 i arrived at la guardia just after noon , and while checking in , asked if there were any available earlier flights the agent said i could stand by on a 12 59 pm flight i passed through security quickly and waited standby for the 12 59 pm the flight was delayed , and they called my name with a handful of others and gave us new boarding passes but i held on to my original 1549 boarding pass i got on that 12 59 flight and had a layover in charlotte i found a place to eat that had a largescreen tv i saw an image of a plane floating in the hudson river none of the passengers was on the wing , and there was no sound coming from the tv i noticed the graphics said , usair flight 1549 , new york la guardia to charlotte , north carolina i said , i think i was supposed to be on that flight i thought i was being quiet , but apparently i said it loudly enough for other diners to hear they looked at me and said , no way , and i went to my briefcase and pulled out the boarding pass i thought i was going to collapse i figured that the passengers were all dead i immediately called my wife and told her that i was n't on the flight a couple of young men in the restaurant started talking it up , telling me that i'm the luckiest guy in the world , and asking if they could rub my head they also suggested i buy a lottery ticket about 15 minutes later , we found out that everyone had been rescued , and there were reports of only minor injuries as word of my nonexperience spread to friends and colleagues , i still get two distinctly different reactions the most common is that i was lucky and must have done something right in my life the second reaction is along the lines of , so , are n't you disappointed that you were n't on the plane \? the short answer is no
the blogosphere is abuzz with talk of which men s tennis player is the greatest of all time i ve been following the postings here at straight sets with great interest i am a huge fan of roger federer , but it is important to note that , even as recently as jimmy connors career , great players have been barred from playing grand slams the reason \? money and professionalism , mainly connors was barred from roland garros in 1974 for signing a contract to play world team tennis he was playing superb tennis that year , winning the other three majors , but he was viewed as a renegade by the tennis establishment connors boycotted the french for several years after that another player whose career path took him from what were then amateur championships and to the nascent professional tour is often overlooked in these goat discussions richard gonzalez , better known by his nickname , pancho largely selftaught on the public parks of los angeles , gonzalez helped develop the professional tour by barnstorming across the country in the 1950s and 60s although he won only two majors \( the us open twice \) , he was revered by his peers his incredible serve , his competitiveness and his longevity as a tennis great are perhaps unmatched he won the longest match in wimbledon history , in 1969 , at the ripe old age \( for a tennis player \) of 41 , defeating charlie pasarell in a fiveset , 5hour12minute marathon at the time , gonzalez had recently become a grandfather surely , had he been allowed to compete in grand slams he would have won quite a few as many comments on the blog have noted , this also affected rod laver s slam tally so perhaps counting slams as the best measure of a champion s stature is not the best way another problem regarding grand slams as the best historical gauge is what might be called the australian problem there are two of them one involves travel the other has to do with a decade or so of lost luster or prestige we forget in our globalized , flat world , where a radiologist in perth may look at an xray from chicago and email back a medical opinion within minutes , that people going to australia in the first half of the 20th century did so by boat it was slow many players opted to stay home , not knowing that 70 or 80 years hence the criterion for tennis immortality would be number of majors won bill tilden never played the australian and neither did jack kramer or bobby riggs or henri cochet or gonzalez , to name just a few bjorn borg played the australian once , which brings up part 2 of the australian problem not many top players ventured down under during the late 70s and early 80s partly because the tournament dates frequently fell on either christmas or new year , and partly because the tournament was not held in as high regard by the players at that time very good players won the australian during this time , but none , with the exception of connors , are being mentioned in the goat comments i ve read the australian got with it in 1988 , when the tournament organizers ditched the grass courts at kooyong in favor of the highbouncing rebound ace surface the tourney dates were pushed to midjanuary , and the aussies built a wonderful modern site to host the championships if you build it , they will come proved true once again but i can t help thinking that borg and connors , and especially john mcenroe would have won more slams if they had played the australian back in the day of the three , i think mcenroe , with his serveandvolley style and his absurdly good hands , would have benefited the most so in this wonderful conversation about who is the best ever , let s make sure to look at players like gonzalez and connors and mcenroe , and remember that for a host of reasons , each lost some opportunities to compete in grand slams
tampa , fla before pittsburgh s final drive , the arizona defense gathered in a huddle linebacker karlos dansby looked his teammates in the eyes , scanning for signs of nervousness or concern he found none be great , he told them the steelers' offense took over at its 22yard line with 2 minutes 30 seconds remaining in the game the cardinals led , 2320 , buoyed by the first safety in a since 1991 and two fourthquarter touchdown passes from kurt warner to larry fitzgerald the cardinals' defense had erased three quarters of shaky play with a dominant fourthquarter reversal and after dansby scanned his teammates , he felt as if they were destined to win the offense had done their part , he said it was time to do our part so much for that destiny thing most everything that went right for the cardinals' defense in these playoffs went wrong until the fourth quarter of super bowl xliii and most everything that went right in the fourth quarter of the super bowl went wrong on the steelers' final drive in eight torturous plays that are sure to stay with the cardinals defenders through the offseason , ben roethlisberger led the steelers to the gamewinning score , an acrobatic tiptoe catch by santonio holmes that overshadowed the defense s role in the cardinals' comeback i do n't know what happened , cornerback antrel rolle said we were beating ourselves we could have won that game the ending was the final spin in the defense s yoyo performance , one that fried its followers' emotions with dramatic and drastic and devastating results in the first three quarters , it seemed that each time the defense closed in around roethlisberger , he squirmed left or juked right , eluding defenders like a matador toying with bulls there was no constant pressure , no usual feast of turnovers , no continuation of the defense s remarkable postseason resurgence that changed for most of the fourth quarter , as the defense forced punts , sacked roethlisberger and brought the cardinals back but when it ended , when holmes caught the winning touchdown pass with 35 seconds left , the cardinals' defense had given the most uneven of performances average for long stretches , spectacular in spurts , disastrous when it mattered most over all , arizona s defensive effort fell somewhere between its eyeopening january and its headscratching performances scattered throughout the season including three games , against the jets , philadelphia and new england , in which opponents scored at least 47 points i'm a diehard football player , defensive tackle darnell dockett said i know it ai n't over until there s 0 00 on the clock they made the plays when they needed to we did n't buried underneath the steady stream of super bowl headlines about their quarterback and their wide receivers , playing opposite the topranked defense in the nfl , the cardinals' defenders spent last week saying that they enjoyed their status as the underdog dansby said the cardinals' real defense had found its true identity in january , when it propelled arizona s offense with field position from 12 turnovers , including eight interceptions , in three playoff games the cardinals have been building this defense since 2004 , since the arrival of the coordinator clancy pendergast that first offseason , the team drafted dansby in the second round , dockett in the third and defense end antonio smith in the fifth the cardinals also added playmakers , like safety adrian wilson and the rookie cornerback dominique rodgerscromartie last tuesday , dansby said he would rank his unit among the best in football he said the playoff performance was no mirage he said these cardinals , the playoff version , compared to any defense , even the vaunted one across the field we like not getting any hype , dockett said after the cardinals won the national football conference championship game rolle said that in january these cardinals learned to play together on sunday , they played together poorly , like when they earned a flurry of penalty flags in the third quarter and they played well together , like when they held the steelers to field goals on two drives deep in arizona territory , like on the dansby interception , like the two dockett sacks in the fourth quarter the watershed moment came late in the fourth quarter with the steelers backed up near their end zone , the cardinals' defense stopped them from moving forward , then finally pushed them back center justin hartwig was whistled for holding chike okeafor in the end zone , leading to the first safety in this game since super bowl xxv , which was also held in tampa the defense ran off the field , the offense scored , and dansby believed , as strongly as he had believed in anything this season , that his team would win when disaster struck instead , the cardinals left the field with their heads down and a nagging feeling , the feeling that they had blown the rarest of opportunities , already sinking in their stomachs we let one slip between our fingers , man , dansby said it hurts
lululemon athletica is probably the best known athletic clothing maker based in vancouver but it is not an official sponsor of the upcoming olympics in its hometown given the company s propensity for stunt advertising , few were surprised on monday when it introduced a winter clothing line with a name suggesting that lululemon has a closer connection to the games than just geography but in an attempt to avoid lawsuits , those products were saddled with a name that only an intellectual property lawyer could love the line of toques , hooded sweatshirts , and tshirts is promoted as lululemon s clothing line for the cool sporting event that takes place in british columbia between 2009 2011 edition the products are offered in the national colors of the united states , canada , sweden and germany lululemon denied that it was attempting to cash in on the olympics without being a paying sponsor , what many people call ambush marketing and the games organizers , who are generally not shy about taking legal action against trademark infringement , told the canadian broadcasting corporation that they were not going to sue lululemon , even though they dislike its marketing they have done a lot of homework to avoid strict repercussions under the letter of the law , said bill cooper , the director of commercial rights management for the vancouver organizing committee said that s a large part of what we find disappointing , that the only standards they held themselves to was the letter of the law lululemon isn t the only canadian clothing maker testing those standards roots canada , a former official clothing supplier to the canadian , american and british olympic teams has introduced a canada collection by roots line of clothing http canadarootscom on demandwarestore sitesrootscasite default pageshow \? cid landingpage righttoplay the clothing looks remarkably similar to the company s offerings during its time as an official sponsor and prominently sports canada s name and signature maple leaf roots donates part of the proceeds to right to play , a charity that sets up sports programs in the developing world like lululemon , michael budman , one of roots americanborn cofounders , rejected suggestions that his company is attempting to exploit the games it s to capitalize on celebrating the country , which is in vogue now , mr budman told the canadian press  none of this seems to have hurt at least one olympic product offered by the game s official canadian clothing supplier , the venerable \( and now americanowned \) hudson s bay company  its stores , which include the zellers discount chain , are swamped whenever another shipment of red olympic mittens arrive fleece lined , the knitted mittens feature the olympic rings on the outside and white fleece maple leaves on the palms \( while billed as torchbearer mittens , the ones given to actual bearers of the olympic flame substitute a rubberized maple leaf for the fleece one to provide a better grip \) olympic fever aside , the one of the main attractions of the mittens is their relatively modest price 10 canadian dollars vanoc announced one million pairs of the mittens have been sold not everyone , however , is enamored with the mittens early last month , all conservative members of parliament , except for prime minister stephen harper , pulled on the mittens and waved to mark the 100th day before the start of the games they were swiftly scolded by the opposition liberal party for breaking parliament s rule against props and for using mittens made in china
seattle over eight seasons covering the yankees , i ve heard over and over that the writers glorify derek jeter , blindly praising his intangibles while ignoring what s right in front of us that jeter is a terrible fielder who hurts his team on defense now , in 2009 , jeter is a wonderful fielder and first baseman mark teixeira is the one who s overrated at least , i ve heard that suggestion the last few days on sunday , jeter set the career record for hits by a shortstop it s notable that someone often criticized for his defense has stayed at the position long enough to set that record here s what jeter said sunday about his longevity you want to try to improve yourself you re going to have good years and you re going to have bad years , but you have to try to take care of yourself and put in a lot of work i ve been fortunate , but i think i have a few more years left in this game i ve always contended jeter defense has not hurt the team as much as some people think now , has he been better in the field this season \? sure , but look at the reasons , none of which have anything to do with jeter himself he has a new infield coach , mick kelleher , whom he trusts and has known for many years he has a better first baseman in teixeira and he plays behind pitchers more capable of hitting their spots than their predecessors , meaning , in theory , that hitters more often hit the ball where the fielders expect it to go jeter is also playing on a new home field and might have made a change in his workout habits , though he never talks about that i don t know how those factors might have impacted him the point is , there are so many factors that go into a player s defense i was chatting about defensive metrics with some yankees on sunday , and one of them put it this way the only way to really compare fielders would be to have all 30 shortstops try to make the same plays under all the same conditions the infield , the pitch , the speed of the runner , how hard the ball s hit , on and on and on and that s impossible look , i like statistics i m friendly with statsminded folks at baseball prospectus and espn i have a bookmark for the fangraphs website i grew up reading bill james and i ve written some nice things about him over the years but i also spend my workdays talking to people who know baseball a whole lot better than i do , because they play it or coach it at the highest level and i don t think i ve met anyone in uniform who gives credibility to defensive statistics when one stat \( uzr \) says teixeira has negatively impacted the yankees in the field , well , it s hard to take that stat seriously teixeira is a savant in the field do you know why he s always sliding for balls to his right \? because he hates the 31 play teixeira understands that gathering a ball without dropping to his knees takes him a few steps farther from first base , meaning he ll probably have to flip to the pitcher covering , greatly increasing the variables that can go wrong it happened to him once as a young player in texas , when pitcher ra dickey fumbled a toss as he looked down for the bag , and teixeira vowed to make more of an effort to take the ball himself so that s what he does in 12 seasons as a beat writer , i ve covered three exceptional first basemen david segui , doug mientkiewicz and teixeira i don t know what their stats were , but i could tell what a difference they made with my eyes \( yes , eyes are a valuable tool when evaluating players \) and i could tell the opposite , too todd zeile and jason giambi are two of my favorite people i ve ever covered but their defense at first base did not help their teams i remember a mets game in los angeles in 2000 when zeile made a wild throw to second on a double play it pulled shortstop rey ordonez off the bag , and when he came down , the runner slammed into his arm with his helmet on a headfirst slide the fracture cost ordonez the rest of the season , and the mets traded melvin mora to get mike bordick to replace him the deal cost the mets about eight productive seasons from mora and giambi \? well , you all remember his madcap antics in the field it s pretty simple jeter knows what he s doing in the field he s not great , but he s good enough he doesn t hurt his team on defense and never really has teixeira is an excellent fielder who helps the team a lot in the field maybe all that stuff just can t be measured the people who play the game don t think it can be , and they know a whole lot better than those of us who don t
even as lawmakers prepare for what is sure to be a grueling fall dominated by efforts to build consensus around an overhaul of the health care system , president obama shifted attention to another subject for a second consecutive week in his saturday morning address highlighting workers on the labor day weekend , the president announced new initiatives he says will make it easier for american families to save for retirement his proposals include a plan that would allow workers to automatically enroll in a retirement fund like a 401 \( k \) and to funnel payments for unused vacation and sick days into that account the times s ed andrews has more in an article today gop address republicans , however , hammered away at the health care debate in their address this morning , featuring

attempt to link the health care overhaul with economic recovery , mr kline said that mr obama s plan would actually eliminate 16 jobs over the next five years , an argument that could have resonance in the wake of a disappointing unemployment report friday those job losses would come largely from small businesses , mr kline said , citing data from the national federation of independent business

up with jones republicans are accusing one of mr obama s top advisers of being a communist and calling for his resignation they say van jones , who was appointed to the white house environmental council to help create green jobs , is a prime example of how the administration is using socalled czars to sidestep congress as it pushes an aggressive , even extreme , agenda mr jones was caught on tape using an unprintable word to describe republicans and allowed his name to be put on a letter requesting an investigation of whether the bush administration allowed the sept 11 terrorist attacks to happen as a pretext for war republicans say theses incidents call into question his ability to handle the 80 billion in tax payer dollars he s budgeted barack obama has hired about 30 czars to address some of the country s toughest problems , but the individuals taking those high level posts do not need to be confirmed by congress like cabinet level positions conservatives are abuzz over the mainstream media s oversight of the story according to the washington examiner , as of 11 30 am friday , none of the major news outlets , including the times , had mentioned the controversy compare that to the washington post s treatment of bob mcdonnell , erick erickson of the conservative red state blog writes , referencing recent news reports examining remarks mr mcdonnell , the republican candidate for virginia governor , made in a master s thesis twenty years ago instead of focusing on mcdonnell s record in office or present events on the campaign trail , the washington post has written nine articles about bob mcdonnell in five days all early administrations draw to their middle and lower levels a certain number of activists from the edges flakes , conservative

as the debate over health care reform unfolds , policy makers and the public need to focus more attention on doctors and the huge role they play in determining the cost of medical care costs that are rising relentlessly doctors largely decide what medical or surgical treatments are needed , whether it will be delivered in a hospital , what tests will be performed , and what drugs will be prescribed or medical devices implanted there is disturbing evidence that many do a lot more than is medically useful and often reap financial benefits from overtreating their patients no doubt a vast majority of doctors strive to do the best for their patients but many are influenced by feeforservice financial incentives and some are unabashed profiteers all americans are affected those with insurance are struggling to pay ever higher premiums , as are their employers if the government is going to help subsidize coverage for the millions of uninsured , it will need to find significant savings in medicare spending , at least some of which should come from reducing overtreatment in the long run , if doctors ca n't be induced to rein themselves in , there is little hope of lasting reform a glaring example of profligate physician behavior was described by atul gawande in the june 1 issue of the new yorker \( his article has become must reading at the white house \) dr gawande , a harvardaffiliated surgeon and author , traveled to mcallen , texas , to find out why medicare spends more per beneficiary there than in any other city except miami none of the usual rationalizations put forth by doctors held up the population , though poor , is not sicker than average the quality of care people get is not superior malpractice suits have practically disappeared due to a tough state malpractice law , leaving no rationale for defensive medicine the reason for mcallen s soaring costs , some doctors finally admitted , is overtreatment doctors perform extra tests , surgeries and other procedures to increase their incomes dr gawande s reporting tracks pioneering studies by researchers at dartmouth into the reasons for large regional and institutional variations in medicare costs why should medical care in miami or mcallen be far more expensive than in san francisco \? why should care provided at the ucla medical center be far more costly than care at the renowned mayo clinic \? after adjusting for differences in health , income , medical price and other factors , the dartmouth researchers' overall conclusion is that the more costly areas and institutions provide a lot more tests , services and intensive hospitalbased care than the lower cost centers yet their patients fare no better and often fare worse because they suffer from the overtreatment the dartmouth group estimates that up to 30 percent of medicare spending is wasted on needless care although most experts think the dartmouth research is essentially right , a few believe that other factors , including the health of individual patients , play a bigger role even if the overtreatment is less than the dartmouth researchers believe , their findings point to areas and institutions where medicare should be able to coax or push physicians to behave more prudently , for all their patients when president obama speaks at the annual meeting of the american medical association on monday he will need all of his persuasive powers to bring doctors into the campaign for health care reform doctors have been complicit in driving up health care costs they need to become part of the solution
general motors filed for bankruptcy this morning , and was replaced in the dow jones industrial average by cisco  this is the end of gm as we know it , writes jonathan cohn at the new republic but it s not the end of gm in these times , it wasn t realistic to expect much more the idea that the united states government will reform gm s way of being and reverse the curse is completely preposterous , writes robert farago at the truth about cars it s like asking a cocaine dealer to sponsor a crack addict  america is lucky , writes peter cohan at daily finance , that it managed to get some grown ups in power when it needed them the obama administration is exercising control over the us auto industry with the kind of efficiency that dazzled the world in the 1950s and back then it was america s business management that was at the top of its game in 1954 , general motors \( gm \) controlled 54 percent of the north american car market today , not so much let s face it the bankruptcy of gm and chrysler forced the companies to do in months what their managers and their boards should have done without government intervention over the past several years the bankruptcy of these companies is a failure of american corporate governance on the biggest scale yet andrew leonard says at salon that maybe the most amazing thing is that having chosen their perilous course of bankruptcy , the obama administration has moved with surprising dispatch for example ever since the full extent of general motors plight became obvious last fall , critics have declared that the government would never be able to get the automaker s vast number of bondholders to agree on significant haircuts that would take chunks out of what they felt they were owed and yet , on the weekend before the administration s june 1st deadline , more than 50 percent consented to a deal that gives them about ten cents on the dollar , plus warrants to buy stock later so , we don t know whether gm will ever be healthy again , and we don t know whether the us is sliding down the slippery slope of state intervention in private industry but we do know this when the obama administration sets a deadline , it isn t messing around  in the coming week , writes marc ambinder at the atlantic , there will be much debate over what it means for the united states to be the majority shareholder of a major car company much of that debate will be serious and interesting there will also be a lot of talk about how the united states is a socialist country in which the government has nationalized half of what was formerly known as private industry that debate will be a lot less interesting at tpmcafe , dean baker writes , the often told story that the uaw made out like bandits is nonsense  workers are making substantial concessions and many will be losing retiree health care benefits for which they already worked decades the bondholders are great whiners , but none of them have said that they wanted the company liquidated they know that they would get less if the federal government had not intervened they whine because they know the media are always sympathetic to investors , so their whines will be presented to the public as serious arguments this could create a political environment in which they could get more money , offering substantial returns to speculators who just bought gm debt at steep discounts michael moore , writing in a piece that appears at the huffington post and the daily beast , lays out his argument for refitting gm to build the new modes of 21st century transportation bullet trains , light rail , clean buses , as well as windmills , solar panels and other means of alternate forms of energy please , please , please don t save gm so that a smaller version of it will simply do nothing more than build chevys or cadillacs this is not a longterm solution don t throw bad money into a company whose tailpipe is malfunctioning , causing a strange odor to fill the car in the financial times \( free registration required \) , robert reich writes that the obama administration is not telling anyone the complete truth gm will disappear , eventually the bailout is designed to give the economy time to reduce the social costs of the blow behind all of this is a growing public fear , of which gm s demise is a small but telling part half a century ago , the prosperity of america s middle class was one of democratic capitalism s greatest triumphs by the time wilson left gm , almost half of all us families fell within the middle range of income most were headed not by professionals or executives but by skilled and semiskilled factory workers jobs were steady and health benefits secure americans were becoming more equal economically but starting three decades ago , these trends have been turned upside down middleclass jobs that do not need a college degree are disappearing job security is all but gone and the nation is more unequal gm in its heyday was the model of economic security and widening prosperity its decline has mirrored the disappearance of both james howard kuntsler calls the gm bankruptcy an epochal moment in us history , like losing a limb or a loved one the us government has decided to drive a chevrolet off the cliff thelma and louise style we were heading there anyway , so why not make the trip in airconditioned comfort , with plenty of room for all the family members , and onboard video entertainment for the little ones in fact , it may not be the bankruptcy of gm itself that will amaze and appall the other nations of the world , so much as the us government s pretense that the company can return to health in just a little while and pay back all the money that the citizenry has allowed to be sucked into its black hole of losses my daddy bought chevrolets in the 1950s , marvelously crazylooking machines with winged taillights that handled like pontoon boats , broke down after 30 , 000 miles , and were tossed out every couple of years not on account of their mechanical failures so much as their obvious lack of uptotheminute styling the postwar prosperity dazzled his generation with its democratic cornucopian bonanzas the innocence of all that is truly lost now there is a dark sense of things shifting out there now in a major way the tectonics of history are taking us to a strange place
so what would you do if your mom or dad , or perhaps your sister or brother , needed a kidney donation and you were the one best positioned to donate \? most of us would worry a little and then step forward but not so fast because of our dysfunctional health insurance system , a disgrace that nearly half of all members of congress seem determined to cling to , stepping up to save a loved one can ruin your own chance of ever getting health insurance that wrenching tradeoff is another reminder of the moral bankruptcy of our existing insurance system it s one more reason to pass robust reform this year over the last week i 've been speaking to david waddington , a 58yearold wine retailer in dallas , along with his wife and two sons i 'd love to know what the opponents of health reform think families like this should do mr waddington has polycystic kidney disease , or pkd , a genetic disorder that leads to kidney failure first he lost one kidney , and then the other a year ago , he was on dialysis and desperately needed a new kidney doctors explained that the best match the one least likely to be rejected would perhaps come from travis or michael , his two sons , then ages 29 and 27 travis and michael each had a 50 percent chance of inheriting pkd and if predonation testing revealed that one of them had the disorder , that brother might never be able to get health insurance as a result , their doctors had advised not getting tested after all , new research suggests that lack of insurance increases a workingage person s risk of dying in any given year by 40 percent at the time david needed a transplant , the people closest to him could n't even offer a lifesaving donation for insurance reasons , said mr waddington s wife , susan travis , who is living in new york and working toward a math doctorate , is anguished at having to weigh insurance obstacles against the chance to save his dad can you put a price on your father s life \? he asked my brother and i talked it over privately , and agreed that we should both go ahead and get tested anyway it seemed like the only course of action we presented our plan to our parents , and of course mom immediately shot it down , with dad firmly behind her we had to respect their right to want to protect us but it was enraging to be in that situation , and to be completely impotent to do anything to help i told myself a number of times that we would reconsider the issue of testing if dad s dialysis stopped working before he got a transplant david waddington finally got that transplant when a kidney from a deceased donor became available but our insurance system has had other excruciating consequences for the waddingtons though pkd has no cure as such , there are experimental medications that may delay kidney problems to get access to the medications , a patient must be tested and since travis and michael waddington do n't dare get tested , they do n't have access to these medications the only way to do it is to lie about your name during testing , to use a fictitious name , susan waddington said that was the advice we got from a major person in the field we did n't do that the genetic information nondiscrimination act , passed last year , should eventually help people get access to health insurance even if they have a genetic predisposition to a disease but insurance companies will still be free to discriminate against people who show symptoms of those diseases that s what s happening now with michael for years , he and travis were afraid to mention to physicians their 50 percent chance of inheriting pkd , but recently michael began suffering pains and went to the emergency room after examining him and ordering tests , the doctor asked him , have you ever heard of pkd \? i felt the jig was up , and i could disclose my knowledge , michael said , so he told the doctor about his father the broader problem is this our broken system leads americans to spend 16 percent of our national income on health care , twice as much as in parts of europe , yet with maternal mortality rates and child mortality rates twice those of the bestperforming countries lack of insurance is linked to nearly 45 , 000 unnecessary deaths a year , according to a peerreviewed study to be published in the december issue of the american journal of public health none of this seems to move members of congress who oppose health reform they have firstrate health care for themselves and so perhaps do n't appreciate how their posturing forces people like the waddingtons into impossible situations let s hope they find it in their hearts to overhaul an existing insurance system that is the disgrace of the industrialized world
the images splashed across the pages of this fall s auction catalogs are as familiar as they are telling dancers and pissarro landscapes picasso portraits and warhol dollar bills all are wellknown paintings and drawings by triedandtrue artists carrying estimates as low as sellers are willing to go in the year since the worldwide recession devastated the art market , prices have tumbled , collectors have retreated and auction houses have instituted layoffs and now sotheby s , and phillips de pury are tiptoeing carefully when the two weeks of big fall auctions start tuesday evening , buyers will find traditional paintings , sculptures and drawings intended to appeal to today s more conservative tastes gone are the lucrative financial incentives like guarantees \( a minimum sum offered to a seller regardless of the outcome of a sale \) that were regularly doled out when times were good gone too are extravagant parties and lavish catalogs the size of telephone books prices are also a lot lower last season many paintings carried estimates in the tens of millions of dollars , though the majority did n't sell sticker shock is no longer an issue the most expensive works carry a high estimate of 12 million it s a more considered market , said tobias meyer , who is in charge of sotheby s contemporary art department worldwide people now think carefully about what they buy and how much they are willing spend prices are also lower because there are n't many blockbuster artworks on the market there were none in the few estate properties that were up for grabs recently , and collectors who do n't have to sell are , for the most part , holding on to their art as they gauge price levels this season s offerings reflect what have jokingly been called the three d s death , divorce and debt sellers include the merce cunningham trust , which administers the rights to the work of the choreographer and dancer who died in july the newsprint magnate peter brant , whose divorce has been tabloid fodder and louis reijtenbagh , a dutch financier who settled lawsuits surrounding several bank loans and is selling artworks to satisfy the claims putting together the sales has been tough , auction house executives admit without guarantees it s been all about relationships and creativity , mr meyer said as often happens , the work of an artist who has recently been the subject of a museum exhibition suddenly surfaces at auction it is no coincidence that a kandinsky is being offered on the heels of a career retrospective , seen at the pompidou center in paris in the summer and now at the solomon r guggenheim museum in new york in this case the heirs of arthur m sackler , the american art collector who died in 1987 , decided it was the right time to part with a 1932 kandinsky filled with his abstract geometric forms it is expected to bring 6 million to 8 million at sotheby s on wednesday perhaps the buzz around pop life , art in a material world , a show that opened last month at the tate modern in london , has something to do with the number of warhols and other pop artists up for sale the undisputed star at sotheby s postwar sale on nov 11 and what may well be the hottest work of the season is warhol s 200 one dollar bills , a 1962 painting from his seminal first series of silkscreens a private european collector is selling the work , which was once part of the celebrated collection of robert c scull , the taxi tycoon and pop and minimalist collector who died in 1986 that year the seller bought the painting from a sotheby s auction of scull s estate for 385 , 000 , at the time a record price for warhol at auction now it is expected to fetch 8 million to 12 million mr brant is also selling a warhol tunafish disaster , a 1963 painting from the death and disaster series , is being offered at christie s on nov 10 with an estimate of 6 million to 8 million in addition mr brant is selling a 1983 sixpanel painting by jeanmichel basquiat , brother sausage christie s experts believe it could bring 9 million to 12 million tuesday night s sale of impressionist and modern art at christie s is perhaps the weakest of the season it s been a struggle , said conor jordan , head of christie s impressionist and modern art department in new york among the highlights are traditional impressionist works like an 1896 degas pastel of a dancer rubbing her feet , which comes from an unidentified japanese collector and is expected to sell for 7 million to 9 million an 1873 panoramic landscape by pissarro is estimated at 35 million to 45 million it is being sold by the london collector lord harris of peckham , chairman of carpetright , a floor covering company there is dealer property too , like mondrian s composition ii , with red , 1926 that other dealers say is from the nahmads , a family that runs galleries in london and new york they bought the abstract canvas at christie s in london five years ago for 29 million and are now hoping to get 45 million to 65 million sotheby s sale on wednesday night is bigger and the material is stronger one of the most important sellers that night is offering works described in the catalog as property from an important european collection that collection , experts familiar with the lots say , is mr reijtenbagh s and includes canvases by bonnard and modigliani , degas and corot there is also a kees van dongen image of a halfnude arab boy , inspired by a trip he took to north africa in 1910 it is estimated at 7 million to 10 million , one of the most expensive works of the evening another bigticket item at sotheby s is a giacometti sculpture , l'homme qui chavire , conceived in 1950 and cast a year later it is being sold by s i newhouse jr , the publishing magnate who owns cond nast , another business that has recently undergone layoffs the 8 million to 12 million estimate may seem high , but the giacometti has been unsuccessfully offered for sale privately by both christie s and the gagosian gallery for nearly twice that estimate experts say that the auction process will help sort out prices for giacomettis christie s has made some estimates in its postwar and contemporary art sale on nov 10 purposely low it is selling several gems that once belonged to cunningham and john cage , his partner in life and work who died in 1992 they include dancers on a plane , a crosshatch canvas by jasper johns that is estimated at 15 million to 2 million paintings by mr johns have sold privately for as much as 80 million brett gorvy , a head of christie s postwar and contemporary art department , explained his firm s approach this season we have consciously stayed away from young artists who either have not yet been tested or whose prices have already got way too high
bogot , president lvaro uribe , the top ally of the united states in latin america , is enmeshed in a scandal over growing evidence that his main intelligence agency carried out an extensive illegal spying operation focused on his leading critics , including members of the supreme court , opposition politicians , human rights workers and journalists the scandal , which has unfolded over months , intensified in recent weeks with the disclosure of an audio intercept of a top official at the united states embassy semana , a respected news magazine , obtained between james faulkner , the embassy s legal attach , and a supreme court justice investigating  other recordings obtained in investigations by journalists and prosecutors point to resilient multiyear efforts to spy on mr uribe s major critics by the , a 6 , 500employee intelligence agency possibly south america s largest that operates directly under the authority of the president s office the agency , known widely by the acronym das , has been the focus of accusations of illegal spying before but this case is sowing fear among mr uribe s critics in the political elite , coming as the president , a conservative populist , presses ahead with a project to secure a third term while mr uribe is ideologically isolated on a continent that has shifted to the left , he is following the example of neighbors who have changed their constitutions to remain in office , like venezuela s president , hugo ch vez , and ecuador s , rafael correa uribe is seriously weakening colombia s democracy , said ramiro bejarano , a lawyer and opposition leader who was a director of das in the 1990s earlier this year , semana obtained recordings , transcripts of intercepts and other files from current and former das employees that showed that mr bejarano was among several senior opposition leaders whose phones were illegally tapped by das five appointees have led das since mr uribe came to power in 2002 the first four resigned amid claims of illegal surveillance and are being formally investigated by colombia s attorney general the accusations against mr uribe s first das director , jorge noguera , are the most serious he is charged with , alfredo correa d'andreis the charges are based on reports that under his leadership , das gave paramilitary leaders their names on an assassination list mr noguera stepped down in 2005 , when mr uribe appointed him consul in milan mr noguera has since left that position , and the government has distanced itself from him but all of mr noguera s successors including the current director , felipe mu oz , are under scrutiny over reports of irregularities , notably wiretaps , which are illegal in colombia without a court order some of the most recent disclosed intercepts were recorded just weeks ago others were made over several years earlier this decade for instance , the special intelligence group , a secret das unit also known as g3 , operated into 2006 and focused on monitoring human rights groups critical of mr uribe s government , like the colombian commission of jurists and the jos alvear restrepo lawyers' collective chills went down my spine when i discovered the lengths that das went through to watch my every movement , said alirio uribe , a human rights lawyer \( no relation to president uribe \) for the jos alvear restrepo collective who , through prosecutors' investigations and congressional testimony , gained access to part of the file that g3 kept on him and his wife and children he compared what he saw in the file , which included photos of his children , transcripts of phone and email conversations , details on his finances and evidence that das agents rented an apartment across from his home to monitor him , to , the academy awardwinning 2006 german film about stasi surveillance in east germany the das was searching for evidence that we received money from the guerrillas , and of course they found none because there was none to find , mr uribe said what does this say about our society and our form of government if the president s own intelligence service deems ngo s its enemies and fit for violations of this kind \? a spokesman for mr uribe declined to comment , referring queries to mr mu oz , a former urban planning official who became director of das this year in an interview near bogot s old center at das s bunkeresque headquarters , which were rebuilt after being gutted in a 1989 bombing attack by drug traffickers , mr mu oz grimly acknowledged the possibility that surveillance irregularities had occurred earlier this decade he said he was leading the most profound reorganization of das since its founding in the 1950s , with plans to cut the agency s work force by as much as half to focus on intelligence , counterintelligence and border control reflecting the legacy of presidents who strengthened das at the expense of other institutions , the agency still carries out a broad range of activities , including registration of foreigners , providing bodyguards to 500 people considered at risk of assassination and serving as interpol s headquarters in colombia das s secret police unit also competes with other colombian intelligence agencies , including the finance ministry s financial crimes division , in carrying out investigations the sprawling nature of das s operations may have allowed some of its agents to sell intelligence to the private armies that have plagued colombia during its fourdecade war , or otherwise be infiltrated by paramilitary and guerrilla operatives in one case investigated by semana , a computer that had been used last year by rebels from the national liberation army held detailed information collected by das on the military plans against the group mr mu oz said he preferred to comment on claims of irregularities since he took over the agency he said an investigation of the recent intercepts was under way , and suggested that rogue agents might be seeking to thwart his overhaul there may be people interested in countering the reforms , he said for the united states , which works closely with das on many intelligencegathering issues , the scandal complicates its warm relations with mr uribe s government , the recipient of more than 5 billion in security aid from washington this decade ian c kelly , a state department spokesman , said last week that the accusations of illegal wiretapping were troubling and unacceptable but in the same statement , he said colombia s to meet standards allowing mr uribe s government to receive all of the military assistance included in the 545 million in american aid that colombia was set to receive this year
tell me , my friend harry wrote this morning in an email message , if you were writing hockey fiction , would his story this season have been believable \? injury , winning streak , tying the record in montreal , breaking st patrick s record on st patrick s day \? no , it sounds like cheap fiction in reality , it s anything but at the end of the game , msg cut to some of the people most important in martin brodeur s new standard for career nhl victories his father , denis devils president and gm lou lamoriello and devils goalie coach jacques caron they all have played essential roles in brodeur s reaching the 552 wins mark , passing patrick roy for the top spot on the chart \( and here s dave caldwell s article in the times \) that number is only going to increase and , if he stays healthy , finishes out his contract and keeps winning at his usual clip \( with perhaps a little more rest \) , brodeur could finish his career with over 660 wins pretty remarkable it s a rare occasion when the new york papers prominently feature hockey news during the regular season and more rare when that hockey news is about the devils \( and you always get the sense lou likes it that way \) , but a record like this cannot be ignored in the daily news , filip bondy writes , for years , we ve been giving short shrift to a player more accomplished within his own sport than patrick ewing , mark messier , derek jeter and tiki barber brodeur has won the vezina trophy four times he was an nhl allstar 10 times he s captured three stanley cups he s even scored goals in the regular season and the playoffs where were we when all this happened \? he should hate us for our provincialism mea culpas aside , we ll see if brodeur s achievement changes that in the daily news or anywhere on the daily news back page brodeur is relegated to a banner while david wright s game winning hit in a preseason international baseball tournament takes the page that s just the way it is here in new york , and elsewhere in the united states , where the general sports columnists and the sports editors in general don t feel safe discussing hockey without deferring to another sport , as if this is the only way to legitimize it to the readership bondy \( who at least knows the game better than most general sports columnists \) , for example , writes this record may be more substantial than any achieved around these parts by a pro athlete since roger maris knocked homer no 61 really \? bondy should know better how about mike bossy s nine consecutive 50goal seasons , which , like brodeur s accomplishment , is a career record or , if you want a substantial oneseason achievement to match maris , how about bossy tying maurice richard s 50 goals in 50 games in 198081 \? oh , sorry , that s hockey not substantial enough bondy doesn t top there like maris mark , brodeur s record comes with a statistical debate brodeur has 27 shootout victories , to none for roy , who retired before the nhl instituted shootouts it s a fair point \( and regular readers know what we think of the postgame skills competition \) but we haven t heard any great hue and cry from the rank and file fans for the nhl to trot out the asterisk maybe we missed it here s the game story in the daily news by kristie ackert  the marty banner is even less prominent in the post here s mark everson s game story and a column by jay greenberg that focuses on the style difference between brodeur and the butterflying roy for those who wish to denigrate brodeur s achievement and longevity because he faces fewer shots a game than other goalies , greenberg presents this quote from marty it s nothing about style really , but about fundamentals , how i get myself in position to make the save that s important to me we give up 810 fewer shots a game here than other places because of the way i control rebounds and there it is the devils big secret revealed at last it comes from a general sports columnist who spent many years as a hockey beat writer , who recognizes he doesn t need the crutch of a nonhockey parallel for readers to understand him , who can write the names patrick kane and dustin byfuglien without shame and without bringing up patrick ewing or dustin pedroia in the bergen record , a writer who disparaged hockey for many years in various newspapers , ian o connor , deigned to write about brodeur on tuesday he came up with a very good \( and highly recommended \) piece on the little told angle of how the devils came to scout and draft him , and the role played by warren strelow , the nhl s first fulltime goalie coach , who tipped off lamoriello about brodeur strelow had been a star high school goalie in minnesota s high school hockey tournament , which o connor is compelled to tell us was not unlike being a star point guard in the indiana state basketball tournament and , of course , he must add that strelow was for brodeur as dick groch was for derek jeter , dick rehbein was for tom brady and tom greenwade was for mickey mantle oh , now we get it here s tom gulitti s game story in the bergen record also in the record , tara sullivan writes brodeur knows a career across the river in ranger blue surely would have brought more acclaim , just as he recognizes a career in his hometown montreal would have made him a superstar too huge to walk the streets in anonymity but he is secure enough in his ability to know he is the best , and sincere enough in his words to know he didn t do it alone he shared this recordbreaking journey with all the right people , from family to teammates to coaches to fans his father denis and brothers claude and denis jr sat in a mezzanine box , his two boys , anthony and jeremy , took a day from their own hockey games to be here and the surgeons and therapists who helped him recover from the torn biceps tendons that derailed his season were invited guests here s rich chere s game story in the starleger and he also had numerous blog posts on the evening , including the news that coach brent sutter will give marty a day off today when the devs play carolina also in the starledger , steve politi writes about how brodeur is all about winning brodeur could have had more zeroes on his contract as the freeagent savior for some desperate franchise instead , he chose to sign for less money so he could stay with a consistent winner he could have occupied a bigger spotlight in toronto or montreal or even across the hudson at the garden , places where he might actually be recognized when he takes off his mask instead , he chose the witness protection program with the devils because he knew that was where he d always have the best chance to win hockey games to win championships and here it comes sports fans in this way , brodeur should serve as a model not only for other goaltenders , but all pro athletes think about the point guards and third basemen who have bounced from one team to another , the ones who let their agents convince them that contract negotiations were another game they had to win think about the quarterbacks and shortstops who uprooted their families because of a few extra bucks , only to watch their careers nosedive in the process oh , well
ribera , nm over the last 11 summers and his wife , deirdre , have welcomed nearly 1 , 000 children with cancer to their cattle ranch here in northern new mexico for weeklong stays intended to be more work than play but this is the first season they have done so since mr imus himself learned that he had cancer in march a biopsy confirmed that mr imus , the outspoken talk show host , had stage 2 , or intermediate , prostate cancer though he was initially advised to begin radiation treatments , he has so far chosen to treat the disease holistically he has been dutifully ingesting habanero peppers and japanese soy supplements as part of a regimen partly devised by his wife , a natural foods proponent , and monitored by a urologist at columbia university medical center the kids want to know why , if i have cancer , i have so much hair , mr imus , 69 , said in a recent interview in the imus ranch kitchen , rustling his shaggy , reddishgray mane when asked if he drew strength from his young visitors , he said i used to think if i was ever in the kind of shape that some of them are in when they come here , i 'd put a bullet in my head but they do n't do that mr imus s cancer diagnosis has done more than alter the dynamic at the ranch , where as many as 10 children at a time most with brain , blood or tissue cancers must be healthy enough to rise before dawn , muck stalls , ride horses and ultimately compete in a rodeo his condition has also changed the tone of his syndicated radio show , which he resumed in december 2007 on citadel broadcasting and its affiliates , after his firing seven months earlier by cbs radio and msnbc over remarks roundly considered racist and sexist do n't you know i have cancer \? mr imus invariably asks guests on the show these days he does so more as a selfmocking plea for mercy than sympathy the other morning he laid his guiltinducing question on bob schieffer , himself a survivor of bladder cancer , who responded in kind you and i have actually talked about it at some length , mr schieffer , the host of face the nation , said via phone from washington , which shows that you also have dementia sometimes the onair conversation has been more professorial , as when mr imus recently spent 10 minutes quizzing rudolph w giuliani , the former mayor of new york , about the side effects of his treatment for prostate cancer \( including with radioactive seeds \) while in office in 2000 it gives you cold sweats , which are kind of embarrassing , particularly when you 're the mayor of new york city at the time , mr giuliani said one thing mr imus has not done is to use imus in the morning heard on about 65 radio stations by more than two million listeners each week , according to estimates by talkers magazine to urge male listeners to be tested i 've always found it annoying when people who do the weather forecast tell you what to wear , he explained the other morning , away from his microphone like you could n't figure that out he added , none of us wear those lame yellow wristbands during the four decades he has been on the air mr imus has always used his life as fodder there was his alcoholism , cocaine addiction and , later , sobriety , as well as his emphysema and the broken ribs and collapsed lung he suffered after falling from a horse in 2000 it s my act , he said while talk of illness does n't tend to make for great radio , mr imus s audience appears to be growing on wabc in new york , the flagship station for mr imus s radio show , he attracted an estimated 130 , 000 male listeners ages 25 to 54 each week in the most recent ratings period , in june that represents a 3 percent increase from the same period a year ago , according to arbitron most weekday mornings this summer he is broadcasting his show live from a studio at the ranch , beginning at 4 am mountain time \( the rest of the year the show , which is also simulcast on rfdtv , originates in midtown manhattan \) the elevation of mr imus s cancer to a regular onair topic represents the second major change in his program in two years after his firing he pledged to make the discussion of race a staple of his new show , and he has , by including two supporting players who are black the comedians tony powell and karith foster the imuses modeled the ranch , which is set on more than 4 , 000 acres dotted with juniper and pinyon trees , at least partly on the 35 , 000acre working cattle ranch in arizona where mr imus grew up after establishing the ranch as a nonprofit organization , mr imus raised 40 million in donations for it , some from companies whose names appear like billboards on ranch buildings , like the aflac rodeo arena over the years the couple have contributed 10 million of their own money to the ranch , they said , and mrs imus said they also pay the ranch s annual administrative expenses , which are more than 250 , 000 \( in 2005 the wall street journal reported that eliot spitzer , then the new york attorney general , questioned some personal use of the ranch by the imuses , but his inquiry concluded with no finding of impropriety \) to anyone who might imagine the ranch as neverland on the mesa , the imuses have a ready retort a central philosophy is that its young guests not be treated as if they are fragile , or special that was made clear to cory trout , 15 , of las vegas , a visitor to the ranch in midjuly as part of a weeklong program not for children with cancer but for those who had lost siblings to sudden infant death syndrome , a group for which mr imus has also raised money this is not a good job , mr imus told cory just after breakfast , as he stood over the boy s freshly made bed see how your sheet is down to the floor \? it needs to be tucked in soon after , mr imus instructed javier rivera , 12 , of new jersey , on the proper way to wear his blue jeans pull up your pants , javier , or i swear i'm going to put you on the next plane back to newark , mr imus said mr imus said his holistic regimen appeared to be having a beneficial effect in initial followup tests , key markers including his psa levels had dropped although he is forgoing more conventional treatments for now like other patients , he worries about side effects like impotence \( or , as he puts it , the dead noodle \) he is not ruling them out among those who said they felt a connection to mr imus s experience was natalee lauro , 13 , a recent ranch visitor who learned five years ago that she had a malignant brain tumor though her equilibrium is unsteady , she said she had been encouraged by mr imus to enter a ranch relay race , which she won at first he s really intimidating , she said by telephone from her home in mesa , ariz he comes around
pontiac , mich for the past few days , tristan williams has spent part of every afternoon at the blue note cafe here , not only for the chicken wings but also for the warmth , electricity and hot water in the men s room he has none of those where he lives in a row house not far from this city s modest business district , about 30 miles northwest of detroit for several hours on monday , mr williams , a college student and janitor , was the cafe s lone customer , charging his cellphone and using the free computer he searched the internet for a batteryoperated home heater and a better job he could not find either so many things are closing because of the economy , even the schools , said mr williams , 19 , who helps support his two unemployed parents as the city seems to be crumbling all around them we want something better , you know at home , our food is spoiled on wednesday , some people like mr williams may have found a small ray of hope here in what is arguably another depressing development for pontiac , with its population of 70 , 000 , 2008 annual budget of 52 million and an outsize accumulated budget deficit of 12 million gov jennifer m granholm has previously stated that the city is in economic crisis , and at a hearing in lansing on wednesday she allowed the city to present its case she is likely to appoint an emergency manager to take over the municipal finances in the next several days pontiac would be s fifth city in 20 years to undergo a state takeover flint had an emergency manager for two years , ending in 2004 two other municipalities have them now highland park and three oaks three would be more than the state has ever had at one time , yet another signal of how entrenched michigan s long recession has become as its name suggests , pontiac is inextricably tied to the flailing auto industry , with general motors being its largest employer gm still makes chevrolet trucks and has its global engine design team based here \( the car named for the city was first manufactured here in 1927 , but production here stopped in the late 1980s \) as gm shed more than 3 , 000 jobs in pontiac over the last two years , it compounded more than a decade s worth of job and population loss the mayor s office and the city council have exhibited an ongoing inability to resolve the city s budget issues , ms granholm said last week in a letter to the mayor , clarence e phillips she cited what a state review team found to be a lack of urgency on the part of city officials , in addition to the city s inability to monitor itself , cash flow shortages , unauthorized borrowing , personnel shortages and managerial control issues the state s intervention began almost two years ago with the review , which led to the signing of a consent agreement between the city and the state , outlining a path for the city to get back to financial stability but the city did not uphold the terms of the agreement , state officials say furthermore , mayor phillips and the city council have not had a good working relationship for months , several local officials say a stateappointed manager would have the authority to bring the city s expenditures in line with revenues , superseding the mayor and council on financial matters mayor phillips did not respond to requests for comment in the local news media , he has expressed surprise about the city s predicament we were n't aware we were in any special trouble , he told the detroit free press last week some city officials were shocked at the mayor s assertion he insists that we 're not in that bad a condition yes we are , said councilman kon bowman before you even begin to address a problem , you 've got to acknowledge it councilman lee a jones added , all we 're doing now is going through daily survival mode of business , keeping up with needs some residents would say that is not really going so well our neighborhoods are going down , the streets are terrible , and jobs are disappearing , said andrea manley , 31 my take on the economy is i'm ready to leave the local public transportation system is notoriously unreliable , eight public schools are closing this year because of falling enrollment and budget shortfalls , layoffs are rampant and small businesses are shutting down only 73 city police officers remain , down from a high of almost 200 several years ago if i had any money , i 'd move away , mr williams , the college student , said wistfully the bus comes once an hour , maybe if you miss it , you 're really messed up the city s outdated web site boasts about a new steakhouse on its main strip as an example of rebirth , but a visit reveals that it is closed and up for sale i'm glad somebody s taking over , because what s happening now is it s being run into the ground , said jeremy williams , 26 , owner of a downtown music production studio the city s resources are n't managed well and there s a lot of potential here there is one bright spot on the horizon a movie studio has announced plans to move into one of gm s old facilities , possibly creating 3 , 500 jobs but for now , people can only dream of those positions kay stevens , 33 , sleeps in a church basement with other homeless women and men ms stevens moved to pontiac from a neighboring county two years ago i was told there would be more opportunities here , she said over a free dinner in a salvation army kitchen i have n't run into a blessing yet , and i 'd do anything

scholars each friday as nearly every other division i conference takes the night off , the ivy league offers the gamblers an opportunity to capitalize on the dearth of information available on teams that represent institutions better known for patents and professors than for athletic prowess banker , 81 , who says he has been a professional bettor for more than 50 years , noticed on feb 20 that sports books in las vegas , where wagering is legal , had listed princeton as a 5point favorite his calculations suggested the score would be closer he figured that princeton should be favored by a point that constitutes a play to me , he said a few hours later harvard beat the 5point spread , and banker had a winning ticket i 've been very successful with the ivy league , just from the feel , he said since its rise to division i status in 1956 , the ivy league has had teams play games on fridays and saturdays to uphold the philosophy that studentathletes are students first this commitment has also made it a favorite destination for educated bettors simply because it gives them something to play on fridays , which typically offer only about 10 men s college basketball games \( about 60 games are usually scheduled for thursdays , and 140 on saturdays \) the attention the ivy league gets from gamblers has cooled somewhat over the last 15 years as the nba has bolstered its friday night lineup one recent friday afternoon , under the theatersized screens of the las vegas hilton sports book , most of the chatter revolved around a couple of nba games on the east coast other college conferences , like the metro atlantic athletic conference , have also taken to scheduling friday night games and , similarly , have attracted gambling action but several sports book directors here said they still took thousands of dollars in bets on friday night ivy games largely from professional gamblers it does n't get any action except for the sharp action , said jay kornegay , the director of the sports book at the las vegas hilton you can sit there and put up all these lines and they 're not going to play anything until you make a mistake whereas a typical top25 matchup may generate 100 , 000 in wagers in nevada , kornegay said , an ivy league game on a friday night brings in about 12 , 000 to 15 , 000 nearly all of it from a few gamblers and most of the time they 're the big plays , he added , meaning bets in the 500 to 2 , 000 range you just do n't have the average joe without wagers from the general public those who gamble for entertainment and not necessarily for a living the sports books are left exposed over the years , some gamblers learned that the conference of harvard , yale , low scores and high grades could be an opportunity because reliable information was at such a premium if columbia suddenly does n't start three guys , we have no way of knowing , said john harper , a senior oddsmaker at las vegas sports consultants , which supplies lines to most of the sports books in nevada everyone has their own method for scouting besides gut feeling , there is the obvious strategy of rigorously examining box scores kenny white , the chief operating officer of las vegas sports consultants , spends much of the offseason doing exactly that it is how he assembles a massive binder that covers every team in division i men s basketball each team has a sheet that lists every player , statistic and result from the previous season and each sheet is tweaked religiously as games come and go as white puts it , he massages the stats and then assigns a number for every side of course , he adjusts for things like past performance , injuries and home court but also for a few more esoteric elements like revenge how badly a team might want to avenge an embarrassing result in their previous meeting thus , for every matchup , he is left with a pair of numbers the difference between them becomes his spread but finding accurate information on injuries is still a challenge white said that web sites like could only take a gambler so far that is why boston , an ivy league alumnus \( pennsylvania \) and a professional gambler for more than 20 years , remains a loyal reader of the ivy league student newspapers because none of the ivy papers publish a saturday edition , he said he was less inclined to bet on the conference s saturday games and besides , there is other action around anyway you 'd actually think the ivy league would be a little tougher than other conferences i bet because you do n't have the information , said boston , who estimates that he and his partner have won close to 100 , 000 betting on ivy league basketball over the last 20 years but because of that , i'm a little more careful with the ivies so are the sports books kornegay and john avello , the director of the book at the wynn casino here , explained that any large bets placed quickly after a point spread was set commanded respect and raised interest these guys are better handicappers than a guy who comes up to the window in a uconn shirt and wants to bet his huskies , kornegay said so we can be more aggressive when it comes to moving the lines we might move it a whole point after a single bet after friday , which is the last friday of the ivy league season , kornegay will not have to worry about it for another 10 months
one of the few emotionally searing moments in the courageous heart of irena sendler , a holocaust movie oddly devoid of them , occurs when the drama is done the face of the real heroine on whom the story is based appears on screen , her words paying tribute to the jewish mothers forced to part with their children during the war and the christian women who gave safe harbor to those sons and daughters irena sendler , who died last year at 98 , was responsible for saving the lives of 2 , 500 jewish children during world war ii , smuggling them out of the warsaw ghetto and delivering them to polish catholic families who reared them until they could be reunited with their parents after the war in 2007 she was nominated for the nobel peace prize but lost to al gore the courageous heart of irena sendler \( a hallmark hall of fame presentation , to be shown sunday on cbs \) recounts her story with none of the zeal , passion , terror and chaos that her mission involved the producers strive for a solemnity that cannot be called maudlin \( as if there were a vast appetite for cool popcultural treatments of the holocaust \) and wind up with something that feels lazy , as if they believed the project s noble goals were enough to carry it when sendler initially comes up with the idea of clandestinely shepherding jewish children out of the ghetto , she meets a measured , predictable brand of resistance wherever she goes take them out \? her mother inquires is that what you are thinking \? past the gestapo \? the german soldiers \? the jewish police \? how is that possible \? you are a social worker a priest tells her that what she plans is too dangerous another mother says it is impossible for women to relinquish their children willingly all of these moments are included , i imagine , so that anyone who might be under the impression that circumventing the ss was really no biggie can be set straight once and for all is sendler , and marcia gay harden , fresh from her strange sexpot litigator on damages , plays her mother , quiet , purposeless and barely present , draped in an afghan ms paquin s plain face , the kind on which conscientiousness is so easily registered , makes her well suited to the role , but her performance suggests that she does n't agree she seems listless and somewhere else , as if she were missing the vampire lust she embodies on true blood , the hbo series in which she stars perhaps this explains why she seems to find her spark only during the movie s lessthannecessary romantic subplot irena sendler has been called the female oskar schindler , and the movie proves that yes , indeed , she possessed a courageous heart it is a shame , then , that the film is all weak bones the courageous heart of irena sendler cbs , sunday night at 9 , eastern and pacific times 8 , central time directed by john kent harrison written by mr harrison and lawrence john spagnola , based on the book the mother of the holocaust children by anna mieszkowska brent shields , jeff most and jeff rice , executive producers jerzy zielinski , director of photography henk van eeghen , editor jan a p kazcmarek , composer produced by hallmark hall of fame productions with anna paquin \( irena \) , goran visnjic \( stefan \) , michelle dockery \( eva \) , danuta stenka \( hannah \) , rebecca windheim \( karolina \) , sergei marchenko \( jasio \) , paul freeman \( monsignor godlewski \) , leigh lawson \( rabbi rozenfeld \) , marcia gay harden \( janina sendler \) and nathaniel parker \( dr majkowski \)
detroit while his teammates clipped at strands of net , wayne ellington wiped at the tears running down his cheeks his thoughts drifted to the past 12 months , to his decision to forgo the and return to college , to his prolonged shooting slump , to the hardware he acquired monday night ellington considered all of what happened between , and he strained for a summary that would explain everything he did not find it you never know what this really feels like until you experience it , ellington , who was named the most outstanding player of the final four , said it s something that you ca n't explain less than two minutes into the ncaa championship game on monday night , ellington made an open jumper minutes later , he made a 3pointer from the left wing to give north carolina a 155 lead it was a good omen for the tar heels although it is point guard ty lawson who powers north carolina s potent offense , and forward tyler hansbrough collects the most trophies on the most talented team in college basketball , it is ellington , and specifically his shooting percentage , that often signals victory in fact , after north carolina beat michigan state , 8972 , to win the national championship , the tar heels improved to 490 when ellington shoots 50 percent or better from the field not hansbrough not lawson but ellington , a less heralded junior guard and the tar heels' third option on some nights and the fourth on others on the court afterward , his shoes flecked with pieces of colorful confetti , he said he did not play well earlier this season but he turned to extra jump shots instead of pity , shooting his way out of the slump , and the result was a swirl of emotions monday night he shot the ball great this tournament , the tar heels' danny green said he stepped up big for us over the weekend , as north carolina dominated its games at ford field , it was a sharpshooting guard from pennsylvania who transformed the tournament into the wayne ellington 3point shootout against villanova in the national semifinals , ellington made five 3pointers and finished with 20 points he made 7 of 14 shots 50 percent on the button , signaling another victory in a north carolina season filled with them tar heels fans sprinkled throughout the green and white sea at ford field screamed for ellington in the first half monday night they appreciated his contribution , maybe more so because he had been doubtful to return this season ellington was a secondteam allatlantic coast conference selection after his sophomore season , and like his teammates hansbrough , lawson and green , he flirted with the nba ellington , green and lawson made themselves eligible for the draft , but none signed with an agent , and they decided to return to north carolina they came back for this surrounded by more than 70 , 000 hostile fans , sentiment and hometown pride in their opponent s favor , one final chance to deliver the national title they had come so close to but never won north carolina coach roy williams said earlier this weekend that his guards make the offense go when teams double and tripleteam the tar heels' waves of post players , williams said , ellington and green provide the outside balance , playing yin to the yang of the tall trees that dominate inside so it was that ellington provided the punch that took the tar heels to the title in the first five games of the ncaa tournament , he scored 25 , 23 , 19 , 9 and 20 points he has one speed , michigan state guard travis walton said his one speed is going hard tonight was his night he had a great tournament run ellington resumed the scoring barrage against michigan state , scoring early and often , staking north carolina to a 5534 halftime lead in the first half , ellington made three 3pointers , scored 17 points and emerged as an early favorite for most outstanding player as the game ended , ellington stood above the tar heels' bench , trying to suppress the tears he knew were coming after the return , the slump and the tournament of a lifetime , his emotions were so strong , so wide and so varied , he could not come close to explaining them maybe the nba awaits after this season maybe not but for now , ellington and his fellow returnees will savor the moment they returned for
detroit labor unions usually dread bankruptcy , and for good reason their pay , benefits and pensions typically suffer significant cuts , as airline and steel workers can attest but for the union , s chapter 11 case , which began in new york on friday , could turn out to be if the company survives and thrives the cadillac of bankruptcies the uaw , for example , has received upfront protection from the treasury department for its pension plan and the fund that will take over responsibility for retiree medical benefits moreover , that fund , called the voluntary employee beneficiary association , or veba , will control 55 percent of the equity in the new chrysler once it emerges from bankruptcy , and hold a seat on the chrysler board of course , those hardfought gains , and the big ownership stake , could be worthless if chrysler does not make it and the company s fortunes continued to sag in april , when sales fell 48 percent compared with the same month in 2008 chrysler will also have to wait roughly two years or more for new cars designed by its partner , the italian automaker fiat , to show up in chrysler dealerships but for now , even though chrysler workers had to agree to lower pay and less generous benefits as part of the deal , the uaw appears to be enjoying relative safety in helping steer the course of the chrysler bankruptcy i'm very comfortable , ron gettelfinger , the uaw s president , said friday on national public radio it s not like we 're going into this bankruptcy fighting with chrysler and fiat and the us treasury we 're going in there in lockstep to put our agreements in place labor and restructuring lawyers said such a comprehensive deal going into bankruptcy was rare this is extraordinary , truly extraordinary , said mary jo dowd , a partner in the financial and bankruptcy restructuring practice at arent fox in washington i never would have thought a year ago that this would occur these are truly unusual times asked if he could recall any other union that fared as well , david l gregory , a labor law professor at st john s university , replied nobody s even close but the uaw is also no ordinary union even though its membership at the detroit automakers has shrunk to a quarter of its size in 1990 , it still maintains tremendous influence in washington , partly because of its heavy political contributions the government , in assessing what was needed to make chrysler viable , decided it needed to support workers , as well as suppliers , and guarantee the warranties on chrysler vehicles because the union agreed to negotiate , it was made a partner , with the government and fiat , in developing the plan to restructure the company in contrast , other companies often use bankruptcy as a way to gain leverage over labor , so that they can lower their costs workers at bethlehem steel , united airlines , delta air lines and us airways lost all or most of their traditional pension benefits when those employers sought bankruptcy protection in this decade , though some of the shortfall was covered by the federal government retiree health care coverage was also cut none of those cases , filed during the bush administration , had the kind of federal support offered to the uaw in the case of chrysler , the treasury said chrysler is giving a veba a 46 billion note , payable over 13 years at a 9 percent interest rate , helping to fund roughly 10 billion in liabilities the rest will be paid in chrysler stock chrysler s pension plans will be preserved , with the help of 600 million from daimler , chrysler s former owner , the treasury said if chrysler goes under , pensions will be covered in part by the federal pension agency , but workers will receive much less than they are owed the veba would be in dire straits , since it would owe the treasury and have nothing to pay it back with the uaw was ready for the probability of a chrysler filing as far back as two months ago , people involved in the negotiations said its stand was clear for it to support a bankruptcy case , workers' health care and pensions had to be protected but the administration , advised by ron bloom , the veteran restructuring expert , also insisted that the union make sacrifices on wednesday , chrysler workers approved concessions , including work rule changes , that would result in lower pay and less generous benefits than in the 2007 contract significantly , the veba can begin adjusting workers' health care benefits in 2010 , two years sooner than the previous contract allowed chrysler workers' concessions , similar to those granted earlier this year at ford motor , form the basis of a prenegotiated labor agreement with the new chrysler , people involved in the negotiations said chrysler s pension liability will shift from the defunct company to the new one , these people said , and workers will continue to have a lucrative contract despite the concessions , chrysler s most senior workers , like those at ford , still have healthy wages and benefits bountiful health care coverage , at least until it is adjusted and subsidies to help bolster unemployment benefits they receive while plants are closed , as they will be at chrysler for weeks until the sale is final that carryover is unusual , ms dowd said , since the buyers of assets in bankruptcy cases normally try to purchase them free and clear of their existing liabilities it also means the union will not have to come to terms with fiat once it takes over the company , or risk having its contracts abrogated none of this sat well with some chrysler s debtholders , who questioned the fairness of the 55 percent stake granted to the veba they did not raise objections in bankruptcy court on friday , however professor gregory said the uaw s position still carried risk chrysler may be worth nothing , and 55 percent of nothing may be worth nothing , he said but a comeback by chrysler after it emerges from bankruptcy could ensure the security of the retiree health care fund , which will begin selling its chrysler shares as soon as possible , mr gettelfinger said friday his legacy , and that of the union , could also could benefit , professor gregory said if chrysler and gm are able to successfully restructure it s walking a very tight rope without a safety net , and a very high wire , he said but if this can get some traction , they could be the envy of not just organized labor , but a lot of folks
the only thing cooler than a pool party on a summer night in new york city is a secret pool party and the only thing cooler than that , as a few enterprising developers recently discovered , is a secret pool party in a pool made out of a dumpster on the banks of the gowanus canal in industrial brooklyn on a rented lot that s hidden from the street they have erected what they call a lofi urban country club three connected pools housed in dumpsters a boccie court some lounge chairs , grills and cabanas on saturday night just three dozen people got the nod to check it out , at an afterparty for the art journal cabinet please do n't forward , the invitation read it s amazing , the artist nina katchadourian said after taking a dip in the moonlight it makes you wonder , as so many things in new york do , what s behind every wall that you ca n't see past bobbing in the water on a pool toy was the last thing i expected to be doing tonight , added aaron levy , a curator visiting from philadelphia since the space opened over the fourth of july weekend , it has been host to barbecues , photo shoots and a film screening lectures and other events are planned for the rest of the summer , but none are open to the public , to the chagrin of the design bloggers and other coolhunters who have been chattering about it the idea , said david belt , a real estate developer and the president of macrosea , the company behind the pools , was not to create an exclusive party destination but to experiment with underused space and materials , repurposing them with urban renewal in mind it s a very simple concept , said jocko weyland , macrosea s project manager there are n't that many places to swim in new york and dumpsters are everywhere they 're ubiquitous the concept itself is borrowed mr belt , mr weyland and alix feinkind , macrosea s creative director , heard about it in april , when they were scouting a project in georgia curtis crowe , a musician in the athens band pylon , had made one after mr weyland had a brief phone conversation with him , macrosea decided to make its own it took about a month to find a suitably out of the way yet accessible space with an agreeable owner \( the pools are insured , mr belt said , and the lot , filled with junk and machinery , is protected by a chainlink fence \) from there the project proceeded quickly and cheaply , in guerrilla fashion the dumpsters were donated by a construction company that suddenly had a surplus \( thanks , economic downturn \) , the designers who helped render the plans were recruited through craigslist , and members of the small crew that erected it in a week were unpaid they just wanted to be able to use it , mr belt said the garbage containers , which he described as newish , were cleaned and lined in plastic , and a filtration system was installed , as on a regular aboveground pool mr belt s wife , antonia , stitched together the coverings for the cabanas the furniture came from ikea the main cost was the wood for the deck and the water about 18 , 000 gallons , delivered from a new jersey aquifer for 1 , 200 i tried to do it so that even if you had to rent one , you could do a standalone dumpster , a grill and chair for under 1 , 000 , mr belt said copycats are welcome , because macrosea itself is using the project as a template for a larger idea turning eyesore strip malls into artsy community destinations , with dumpster pools and other indie attractions i thought if we could get people to come here and swim in a dumpster , i could probably use the same aesthetic sensibility to get people and , not incidentally , better retailers to come to a dingy strip mall , mr belt said the company hopes to open its first repurposed shopping center in atlanta this fall , ideally with dozens of pools in the parking lot that visitors can rent for the day while the project is conceptually simple get a bunch of trash containers , clean and seal them , fill with water , jump in there were a lot of details to finesse the coarse edges inside the containers were filed down , and underneath the liners , the bottoms were covered in sand , for soft landings tightly packed sandbags double as benches along the walls , and pool toys and kidfriendliness provide an intentional counterpoint to the neighborhood grit with brightly colored lanterns crisscrossing overhead and music piped in from an ipod connected to a boombox , the feel is of a doityourself urban oasis the water s amazingly fresh , for swimming in a dumpster , said alexis bloom , a documentary filmmaker from tribeca , after doing a few laps she compared it favorably to the pool at soho house , an actual urban country club the problem , of course , with having such a sexy space especially a sexy private space is that everyone wants to come after mr weyland gave an interview to readymade , the diy design magazine , two weeks ago , breathless coverage and links began appearing all over the blogosphere soon the location was decoded one post led to people standing on the roofs of cars in a nearby lot , snapping photos , mr weyland said with an eye roll though they 're certainly aware that there s nothing more tantalizing to some new yorkers than a party to which they were n't invited , the creators profess surprise at the level of attention their project has received i'm glad that people like it , mr belt said but it s not the end all , be all they hope that visitors will be as chill as the cabinet magazine partygoers , who somehow resisted the temptation to text all their friends the minute they got there it s so easy to ruin something , one sighed the pools are supposed to be open through august or until the coolness wears off if it gets really crowded , mr belt said , i 'll shut it down
san diego because the world baseball classic s two secondround sites are on american soil , their games are quickly demonstrating how this tournament exists far less for the united states than for certain ingredients of its melting pot on sunday , there were just 11 , 059 tickets sold for team usa s doordie victory over the netherlands in miami gardens , fla , the previous day s games , one involving puerto rico and the other venezuela , sold more than 30 , 000 and more than 17 , 000 and in san diego , games on sunday between japan and cuba , and then korea and mexico , drew at least 20 , 000 apiece korea s 82 drubbing of mexico late sunday night attracted a particularly vocal crowd to petco park with tijuana just 15 miles down interstate 5 and a large korean community throughout southern california , the game almost resembled a home affair for both teams it also evidenced how expatriate fans delight in using the word root as both a verb and a noun antonio l pez , an associate in a medical and legal consulting company in san diego , was born in mexico before moving to the united states at age 9 as he watched his greenandwhite team face korea , he said this tournament is about national pride we can wave our flag with pride several sections over , three koreanborn sisters yelled , daehan minguk , which essentially means , korea ! they were not really baseball fans they just wanted to reconnect with their homeland usually when i live in america , i feel like i'm american , but tonight , i feel like i'm from korea , said kris yi , who moved from her home nation in 1976 at age 20 , became a teacher in southern california and now works for a family business in chula vista judging by the loud korean cheers sunday night a continuation from 2006 , when korea appeared to have the most passionate fans throughout the inaugural classic she was joined by many members of nearby korean communities , which have grown in part because of nearby samsung and hyundai facilities we 're connecting to our culture here , yi said , soon after finishing her seventhinning stretch and a spirited rendition of take me out to the ball game it s belonging to a culture it feels really exciting , and makes me really proud san diego s next two games were to be allhispanic and allasian matchups cuba and mexico played in monday night s elimination game , and korea will play japan on tuesday night the winner on tuesday earns an automatic berth in the semifinal round that begins saturday in los angeles cuba and mexico looked awful on sunday , mexico in particular many new yorkers , regardless of their national heritage , will be particularly interested in the primary reason mets pitcher oliver p rez p rez all but served batting practice to korea s hitters over four and twothirds innings he yielded four runs on six hits and two walks three pitches ambled over the heart of the plate and were crushed for solo home runs to left field by bum ho lee in the second , tae kyun kim in the fourth and young min ko in the fifth \( somehow , they all came with no one on base , as did one pitch that hit the backstop on the fly \) p rez was booed loudly not so much by mexican fans , who would have been entitled , but by most of the stadium , for diffidently throwing more than a dozen times to first base , delaying the inevitable this failure followed p rez s first classic start a week ago in mexico city , when he yielded four runs on seven hits in two innings against australia some of those pitches were good , but we also need to understand that they are professional players , and that s what the results came to be , p rez said p rez s reminder that korean players have talent underscores how little is known about them among followers of major league baseball none of the victorious koreans on sunday night have played even one game in the big leagues mexico s players had appeared in more than 5 , 000 almost as striking in that regard is the difference between each secondround bracket s four teams , which might , somewhat paradoxically , explain why the san diego bracket has been more attractive other than mexico , sunday s doubleheader in san diego featured two teams whose players had not one game of major league experience \( korea and cuba \) and one \( japan \) with a little more than 2 , 000 , more than half of those belonging to one player \( ichiro suzuki \) call this the novelty bracket over in florida is the beenthereseenthat bracket saturday s doubleheader , consisting of team usa , venezuela , puerto rico and the netherlands , featured players with more than 30 , 000 games of major league experience the united states , puerto rico and venezuela each had more than 9 , 000 , with allstars all around americans , knowing that these players will be on television for the next six or seven months , appeared contented with college basketball s runup to the ncaa tournament but in san diego , where fans got to root for the teams of their roots and players they almost never see , it was a different type of march madness , fresh as the ocean air
president obama met on saturday with richard phillips , the captain of a usflagged cargo ship who was held hostage by somali pirates last month in their meeting on saturday , mr obama and mr phillips , accompanied by his wife andrea , chatted on sofas in the oval office the white house released a photograph of the meeting but did not release details of their conversation after the navy rescued of mr phillips , mr obama said , i share the country s admiration for the bravery of captain phillips and his selfless concern for his crew his courage is a model for all americans after the meeting , mr obama changed into black sweats and a chicago white sox baseball cap and a motorcade whisked him to the fitness center at nearby fort lesley j mcnair , site of the national defense university , to play basketball his companions included his personal aide , reggie love , a former captain of the duke university basketball team after the game , mr love had a bandage on his chin , according to the pool reporter at the scene and on return to the white house , he muttered he might need stitches the players included a group of guys he used to play with at the y until he departed for what one of them described as that whole campaign tour , a phrase that came complete with finger quotes apparently the obama side beat their younger opponents in three out of five games of 21 , although none of that has been independently verified
bert blyleven threw a wicked curveball , and whatever batters called it the deuce , the yakker , the hook or uncle charlie it was pretty tough to hit why \? it s a figment of your imagination , blyleven kidded ever since someone snapped off the first curve , and there has been a centuryold debate whether it was candy cummings or fred goldsmith , there has been equal discussion over exactly what the pitch does in flight there s something physical about it and something illusory about it , the said a diehard mets fan well versed in the field of visual sciences , shapiro has studied curves from every angle , and he reached the same conclusion as many other experts they look like they jump or break or do all these funky things , but they do n't , he said the idea that the bottom falls out is n't so he added i'm not saying curveballs do n't curve i emphasize that , yes , they curve they just do so at a more gradual rate instead of making a sudden hook , they would form a really big circle that might have pleased he had a favorite line for those who doubted the ball moved at all dean liked to say , stand behind a tree 60 feet away and i 'll whomp you with an optical illusion ! shapiro , however , offers a new theory on why hitters might think a ball bends so drastically the eye exaggerates the break shapiro said the brain processes objects it sees in peripheral vision differently than things it observes looking straight on so a batter tracking a pitch from the corners of his eyes might throw himself a curve to illustrate his point , shapiro presented a tantalizing design that recently was judged the world s best visual illusion by a group of neuroscientists and psychologists it depicts a spinning ball that quickly changes direction , depending at which angle it is viewed straight on , it appears to simply drop from the side , it seems to veer i'm not saying this is it , shapiro said it s a hypothesis shapiro developed the illusion with three collaborators the university of southern california professor zhonglin lu and the former students emily knight and robert ennis i would agree there is an illusion taking place when a batter visually tries to deal with a curving pitch , but not due to peripheral vision , the hall of famer mike schmidt told the associated press in an email message curveballs are like snowflakes , none are the same , schmidt wrote no two curveballs have the same rotation speed , velocity toward the hitter , arm delivery angle or break nolan ryan and bert blyleven had the tightest rotation and velocity combination schmidt batted 348 \( 8 for 23 \) against blyleven , hitting two home runs and striking out five times hitters are seeing the ball with both eyes , not out of the side of the front eye as suggested , schmidt wrote i believe the illusion is a result of the speed with which the action takes place , not a peripheral view then again , i'm not a scientist , just a hitter blyleven won 287 games and two world series rings he is now a minnesota twins' announcer blyleven said he used to listen to the dodgers' broadcaster vin scully describe sandy koufax s curveball on the radio as a ball that was almost tumbling i visualized the dropping motion , he said blyleven said he worked off the thirdbase side of the rubber , especially to righthanded hitters , to make it harder to pick up he saw the differences in shapiro s illusion , and focused more on his own grip and motion shapiro will move from bucknell , in lewisburg , pa , to american university in washington this fall , and will keep rooting for the mets he admits that when he watches games with his 10yearold twins , benjamin and sarah , and his 7yearold son , joel , his critical apparatus goes down as in , when mets ace johan santana gets in a jam , shapiro becomes more of a fan and less of an expert oh sure , he said i 'll be like , c'mon , break one off right here'
today is the 50th anniversary of the court ruling that overturned america s obscenity laws , setting off an explosion of free speech and also , in retrospect , splashing cold water on the idea , much discussed during sonia sotomayor s supreme court confirmation hearings , that judges are umpires rather than agents of social change the historic case began on may 15 , 1959 , when barney rosset , the publisher of grove press , sued the post office for confiscating copies of the uncensored version of d h lawrence s 1928 novel lady chatterley s lover , which had long been banned for its graphic sex scenes most lawyers of the time would have advised mr rosset that he had a weak case back in 1873 , anthony comstock , the former postal inspector who founded the new york society for the suppression of vice , had persuaded congress to pass a law outlawing obscenity , which state and federal courts came to define over the decades as works that community standards would regard as lustful , lewd , lascivious or prurient as recently as 1957 , the supreme court had ruled in a case involving a bookseller who sent erotic literature through the mail that the first amendment s guarantees of free speech did not apply to obscenity the case against lady chatterley s lover seemed cut and dry whatever the book s literary merits , it met the legal definition of obscenity however , mr rosset hired a lawyer named charles rembar , whom he 'd met playing tennis in the hamptons rembar had never argued a case in court but was an adviser to several writers , including his cousin norman mailer \( when mailer wrote the naked and the dead , his careersparking world war ii novel , rembar advised him to avoid legal controversy by spelling his characters' most common utterance fug the trick worked \) looking over the roth decision , rembar spotted a loophole the opinion , written by justice william j brennan , noted that the first amendment s purpose was to assure unfettered interchange of ideas and that all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance unorthodox ideas , controversial ideas , even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion have the full protection of the guarantees but , brennan went on , implicit in the history of the first amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance rembar mulled over a question that brennan apparently had n't considered what if a book met the standards of obscenity yet also presented ideas of redeeming social importance \? by brennan s logic , would n't it qualify for the first amendment s protection after all \? on a sheet of paper , rembar drew two slightly overlapping circles he labeled one circle material appealing to prurient interests he labeled the other material utterly without social importance by brennan s reasoning , only material that fell inside both circles that was both prurient and worthless should be denied the privileges of free speech this was the argument that rembar made before judge frederick van pelt bryan of the united states district court for the southern district of new york with the assistance of several literary critics' testimony , he presented lady chatterley as a novel of ideas that inveighed against sex without love , the mechanization of industrial life and morbid hypocrisy the united states attorney representing the post office , s hazard gillespie jr , thought rembar had misread the law , and he recited a clause of the roth ruling that rembar had omitted justice brennan had written that controversial ideas have the full protection of the first amendment unless , gillespie underlined , these ideas were excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests one of those interests , surely , was keeping obscenity under wraps hence rembar s argument was irrelevant this was , however , just the rebuttal rembar was hoping for he pointed out a footnote in which brennan elaborated on what kind of more important interests were excludable all of them involved actions peddling , picketing , parading without a license , playing loud music from a truck the first amendment did n't protect any of that but none of brennan s examples involved writing expression unattached to conduct pure expression could be forbidden , rembar argued , only if it was utterly without social importance on july 21 , 1959 , judge bryan ruled in favor of grove press and ordered the post office to lift all restrictions on sending copies of lady chatterley s lover through the mail this , in effect , marked the end of the post office s authority which , until then , it held absolutely to declare a work of literature obscene or to impound copies of those works or prosecute their publishers this was n't exactly the end of obscenity as a criminal category into the mid1960s , barney rosset would wage battles in various state courts over william burroughs s naked lunch and henry miller s tropic of cancer , other grove novels now widely regarded as classics but the chatterley case established the principle that allowed free speech its total victory the post office did appeal judge bryan s verdict a panel of three judges upheld it unanimously the government s lawyers decided not to appeal further to the supreme court they knew that they would lose that the justices who , just two years earlier , had excluded this sort of literature from constitutional protection would now change their minds they knew that rembar s creative view of justice brennan s opinion a view that brennan had not explicitly considered when he wrote it was logically unassailable the case also made clear that laws are more complex than strike zones or foul lines , which is why the analogy between judges and umpires is so misleading the distinction is sharpened by another argument rembar made during the lady chatterley trial a novel , no matter how much devoted to the act of sex , he said , can hardly add to the constant sexual prodding with which our environment assails us in the mass media of the day , with its appeals to a booming youth market , movies and advertisements were often calculated to produce sexual thoughts and reactions , to the point where we live in a sea of sexual provocation in short , community standards were radically changing the proof was that , after the ban on lady chatterley was lifted , the book reached the no 2 slot on the new york times bestseller list \( topped only by leon uris s exodus \) and , within a year , sold two million copies for many decades , the courts upheld racial segregation then , suddenly , they did n't for many decades , the courts let the post office decide which books people could read then , suddenly , they did n't in both cases , and many others that could be cited , the laws had n't changed society did and the courts responded accordingly

the 147 million for a new airport on an alaskan island that averages only 42 flights a month the halfmillion dollars for a new skateboard park in unemploymentravaged rhode island the 34 million for fencing and tunnels to keep florida turtles from becoming roadkill those proposals for spending federal stimulus money were all criticized by cable news commentators , republican officials and , in the case of the airport , the inspector general of the transportation department but they have something else in common , too they are popular locally and they underscore a truth that has been evident since the new deal sometimes the boondoggle is in the eye of the beholder dan clarion , the maintenance manager and harbor master in , a town of about 170 people on an island off alaska , said the new airport was vital for safety reasons the island s current runway is too short , mr clarion said , and its location leaves it vulnerable to dangerous crosswinds that sometimes shut down the airport , stranding islanders who rely on planes for their mail , their groceries and their access to the mainland when the seas are too high many times it s the only way we can get in and out , mr clarion said by telephone the outcry that greeted pawtucket , ri , over its plans to spend stimulus money on a playground with a skate park at a junior high school was so fierce that city officials soon scrapped the idea and decided to spend their stimulus money on road work instead but residents of pawtucket had sought the skate park for a decade to lure skaters off the steps of the city s library , the granite walls by the old mill and even the steps of city hall so the city is building it anyway , using the original source of federal financing that it had planned to use before the stimulus law passed and florida s plan to build a wall and culverts to help turtles cross a deadly stretch of road by lake jackson near tallahassee was mocked by senator tom coburn , republican of oklahoma , in a report he issued in questioning many stimulus projects why did the turtle cross the road \? the report asked to get to the other side of a stimulus project but local advocates have sought the monitoring the steady stream of turtle deaths , building the temporary fence that protects turtles there now and mounting a large grassroots campaign that eventually won state support for a more permanent ecopassage of course , none of these projects are likely to stimulate much in the way of new , longterm economic activity , a goal of the federal stimulus plan , once the construction crews decamp but neither will many of the street repaving jobs that are getting the bulk of the highway money in the stimulus bill , however badly they may be needed one of the main purposes of the stimulus is to use government spending to prop up the economy in the short term by offsetting the decline in privatesector spending but in doing so , the obama administration has given rise to a debate that goes back many decades the divide has n't really changed since the depression , said nick taylor , an author who chronicled the fierce debates of the new deal era over boondoggles in americanmade the enduring legacy of the wpa \( bantam , 2008 \) mr taylor said many of the projects that were mocked back then as boondoggles went on to have long and productive lives but he added that there were some truly wasteful projects back then as well , like a lake dug at a spot in north carolina that turned out not to have a water source before it became a bad word , boondoggle was an innocent , humble craft it was the boy scouts of america who claimed credit for coining the word , to refer to the plaited leather lanyards that they made and wore around their necks that all changed on april 3 , 1935 , at a hearing in new york city on how new deal relief money was being spent a brooklyn crafts teacher reluctantly testified that he was paid to show the jobless how to make boon doggles the outcry was swift 3 , 187 , 000 relief is spent to teach jobless to play , trumpeted a boon doggles' made a new , more sinister meaning was born , and the word came to signify government makework , later referring to wasteful government projects in general critics used it to criticize scores of projects , but president franklin d roosevelt took a longer view if we can boondoggle ourselves out of this depression , roosevelt said , that word is going to be enshrined in the hearts of the american people for years to come the depression ended , but the word has not exactly been enshrined in the hearts of the people now , as a new administration in a new century tries to pump 787 billion into the economy with a combination of spending and tax cuts , questions about the usefulness of projects are raging as loudly as ever , even as some economists begin to credit the stimulus with averting an even worse downturn boondogglephobia was a guiding principle in the writing of the bill after a water park in florida was mocked for seeking stimulus money while the bill was being drafted , a provision was added barring states and local governments from using their money to build swimming pools \( swimming pools may sound frivolous , but they are also popular the government built hundreds of them during the new deal , including 11 of new york city s biggest , grandest pools , many of which are still in use \) another provision barred state and local governments from spending their stimulus money on zoos , which were another big recipient of new deal money \( the national zoological park in washington , which is part of the smithsonian institution , is apparently exempt it is getting 114 million from the stimulus for repairs and safety projects \) robert d leighninger jr , a sociologist who wrote longrange public investment the forgotten legacy of the new deal \( south carolina university press , 2007 \) , recounted the story of a works progress administration official in arizona who went off in search of boondoggles , and discovered that the towns he visited seemed to like their own projects but questioned those of their neighbors i 've been hunting all over the state for one , but everywhere i go i'm told it s in the next county , the official was quoted as saying in a 1936 newspaper article so far i have n't been able to catch up with a real , live one

second goal after 73 minutes hull city was promoted to the premier league with west brom last year and made a stunning start , winning six of its first nine matches that form has long since deserted

for a depressing example of how members of congress can be spoonfed the views and even the exact words of highpowered lobbying firms , consider remarks inserted into the congressional record after the debate and vote on health care reform in the house as robert pear on sunday , statements inserted into the official record by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten , in whole or in part , by lobbyists working for genentech , a large biotechnology company that expects to prosper under some of the provisions in the reform legislation the company estimates that 22 republicans and 20 democrats picked up some of its talking points the comforting news is that none of the ghostwritten material sought to change the contents of the bill , which was not open to much revision during the debate rather , the statements were inserted into the congressional record as revisions and extensions of briefer remarks made by legislators on the house floor still , there they are in the official record for historians to read , or perhaps a judge trying to determine the lawmakers' intent in passing this bill the apparent goal was to show that , even though there were sharp divisions between the parties on the overall reform bill \( only one republican voted for it \) , there was bipartisan support for provisions relating to drugs produced by the biotechnology industry one provision , for example , would allow generic competition to expensive biological drugs but only after the original manufacturer had enjoyed 12 years of exclusive use , a generous period by anyone s standards an email message from one top lobbyist urged his colleagues to conduct aggressive outreach to congressional staff members to secure as many supportive statements from their bosses as humanly possible sure enough , republicans who denounced the overall bill , said in their industryfed statements that the biological drug provisions struck the appropriate balance it is disturbing that the industry was able to so easily shape the official record to its liking it is even more disturbing that so many members of congress were willing to parrot the industry talking points
will not face charges for crashing his car into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his house early friday beyond a traffic citation for careless driving , the florida highway patrol announced after ending its investigation tuesday a highway patrol spokeswoman said at a news conference in orlando that although woods was found to be at fault in the incident , evidence did not support further investigation or subpoenaing woods s medical records additionally , the highway patrol said , no claims of domestic violence had been made conviction of careless driving would result in a fine of 164 and four points on woods s license there was no testimony or evidence to support any charges other than careless driving , sgt kim montes , a florida highway patrol public affairs officer , said meanwhile , woods s neighbors , who rushed out of their house to help him and called 911 , tried to clear up some of the mystery surrounding that night , saying through their lawyer that woods s injuries appeared consistent with a minor car crash and not an altercation with his wife bill sharpe , a lawyer for jerome and linda adams , the woodses' nextdoor neighbors in the gated community of isleworth , shared their observations in a news conference tuesday at his office in orlando sharpe said the adamses ran out to see what happened after hearing the crash and found woods lying on the ground being helped by his wife , elin , who urged them to call 911 he said they saw scratches on woods s face , but did not suspect they were caused by anything other than the accident the scratches on the face were consistent with somebody in a minor car accident , sharpe said none of his injuries looked like he was beat up by his wife sharpe said that woods appeared woozy to jerome adams , a retired physician , who then instructed woods not to move and placed a pillow under his head and covered him with a blanket someone from the family three of the adams children also came out of the house called 911 , but sharpe did not say which one although neither woods nor his wife had talked to the florida highway patrol as of tuesday , the adamses were interviewed by the police sunday , sharpe said they retained a lawyer because they have been inundated with requests from reporters and believed the version of events they told to the police was being misrepresented in the news media these people were trying to be good neighbors , sharpe said they do n't want to be movie stars sharpe said someone in the family was awake and watching television at the time of the incident around 2 25 am and rushed outside at the sound of the crash he said the adamses described themselves as friends of the woods family they have a good relationship with mr woods , and they 'd like to keep it that way , sharpe said among the unanswered questions are why woods was leaving his home at that hour , the circumstances surrounding the presence at the scene of his wife , and how he sustained his injuries the windermere , fla , police chief , daniel saylor , said that woods s wife had told the police she had used a golf club to break the rear window of the sport utility vehicle to help extricate woods according to sharpe , the family said woods s wife did not appear to be anything but concerned about her husband and they did not see anything inconsistent in his behavior it did not appear that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol , sharpe said of the family s account he did not appear to have been in a fight with his wife he did n't look like he was beat up with a 9iron
many of con edison s challenges are well known blackouts and steam pipe explosions included but a lesserknown problem has proved no less nagging how to protect equipment from the thousands of that nest in the utility poles of queens and brooklyn also called monk parrots or quaker parrots are attracted to the heat given off by the transformers and other equipment high up on the utility poles their nests often wreck the electrical equipment by engulfing the electrical devices , blocking ventilation the resulting trapped heat can cause the devices to shortcircuit , and often to catch fire , sometimes leading to local power failures in eight fires on overhead equipment in past 18 months , the nests are the main suspects con edison officials have tried to shoo the birds with nets , spikes , deterrent sprays and sound machines none have been successful , said al williams , a senior scientist with con ed who tracks the monk parakeet , a native of south america one con edison crew has come up with its own solution a plastic batterypowered owl that swivels its head and makes a hooting noise , bought at a local nursery the idea came from gerry goodwin , 65 , a 44year con edison veteran who tired of continually replacing the 24 , 000volt feeder reclosure on a pole on 11th avenue , just off clintonville street in whitestone , queens , which has become a main parakeet habitat , along with canarsie and midwood in brooklyn these things cost about 20 , 000 to replace , and we 've gone through five in the past couple years , mr goodwin said of the feeder reclosures these nests are killing us pondering the problem , mr goodwin recalled that a coworker had installed a plastic owl on his boat to keep sea gulls away i figured , if it works for sea gulls , it 'll work for parakeets let s put one up on the equipment , ' mr goodwin said so last year , they bought an owl and named him hootie hootie worked like a charm months went by with no new nests but suddenly the nests were back , and again they caused the feeder reclosure to shortcircuit and catch fire hootie s batteries must have run out , the workers said , and the birds immediately detected him as a fake and built their nest next to him i think one of them married hootie , joked sam maratto , a con edison supervisor at any rate , when mr goodwin took hootie down , he saw that he had been damaged by the fire so mr maratto drove to a nearby plant nursery and bought another one , and a set of fresh batteries on the way , mr maratto pointed out some huge nests in the area when the nests become wet , he said , they conduct electricity and cause the devices to shortcircuit and explode they 're all over , and they 're huge , he said he stopped at a device on a pole near seventh avenue and 150th street smothered by a huge nest look at that capacitor bank it s a condominium , he said it s engulfed that s a piece of con ed equipment you ca n't even see it according to the prevailing theory , the birds escaped from cargo at and now proliferate mostly in brooklyn and queens , with perhaps 300 nests that cause a tremendous cost to con edison , mr williams said the men said working in whitestone had given them double duty as parrot home wreckers \( though parrot sympathizers should know that the birds rebuild their homes within several days \) when working on nestinfested equipment , con ed workers must wear protective suits and face masks these birds do n't go easy , said one worker , patrick chery they hover right around you , and if they have eggs in the nest , they 'll attack you mr goodwin said that the hootie solution seemed like the way to go citywide , except for the need to change the batteries every few months he has asked con edison engineers to come up with a way to feed lowvoltage direct current from the lines to power the owls last week , mr chery mounted the new hootie within minutes , a parakeet flew over to take a look steve baldwin , who runs , a web site devoted to chronicling the wild urban parakeets , said the parakeets have strong instincts to return to their original nesting spot they will not be fooled for too long by a plastic owl , he said a better solution might be using recorded hawk calls to deter the parakeets , he added , and providing alternate nest platforms on poles i know there are people who think con edison is killing them , but i think they 're pretty humane about removing the nests , he said it would be nice if , on our con ed bills , there was a box you could check to donate 5 for humane monk parakeet nest removal
weak reviews , cranky fans , a pirated version none of it mattered  xmen origins wolverine kicked off the springsummer blockbuster season with 87 million in ticket sales , continuing the year s boxoffice boom and keeping a core franchise alive for 20th century fox and marvel entertainment the fourth in a series that began in 2000 with xmen , wolverine stopped short of the performance by iron man , which took in about 986 million when it was released by paramount pictures and marvel on the same weekend last year but the fox film , which was directed by gavin hood with hugh jackman in the lead role , became an instant hit in the face of obstacles that have included boycott calls some of them triggered by fox s earlier threat to block warner brothers from releasing watchmen in a legal dispute and a stillunsolved leak that put a pirated version of wolverine on the internet a month before its release the performance was particularly impressive in that wolverine opened without the advantage of the supersized imax screenings demand for the bigscreen technology has exceeded supply that have boosted the opening weekend of fantasy thrillers like the dark knight  if you had to nail it down to one thing , it would be the affection and appetite for hugh and the character he s created , said chris aronson , a senior vicepresident of fox s distribution unit , said of wolverine s resilience mr aronson said concern over the online leak had been agonizing , and that even as late as saturday night a heavily viewed nba playoff game had bitten into audiences in chicago and boston and the critics did not help one of many to pan the film , a o scott , writing in the new york times , cited it as evidence that the superhero genre is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue but an unexpectedly large female audience nearly 50 percent of the total and a possible return of fans who were distracted by the basketball game boosted fox s expectations for the film s continued strength returns from 101 foreign territories reached about 73 million , to give the film a global boxoffice take of about 160 million , mr aronson said  ghosts of girlfriends past , a romantic comedy with matthew mcconaughey and jennifer garner , took in about 153 million to place number two for warner brothers and its new line cinema division , according to a studio estimate last weekend s numberone film , obsessed , a thriller from sony pictures and its screen gems unit , placed third this weekend , with about 122 million in sales , and a total of 47 million since opening on april 24 other pictures in the top five were 17 again from warner brothers and new line , with about 64 million in ticket sales and 485 million since opening on april 17 , and monsters vs aliens from paramount and dreamworks animation , with 58 million , and 1824 million since its release on march 27 in all , the weekend s top 12 films took in about 1522 million , up about 1 percent from 1507 million last year , when iron man which eventually took in over 318 million to become last year s second biggest hit , after the dark knight turned in an exceptionally strong performance , according to the hollywoodcom boxoffice tracking service for the year to date , the total box office is about 32 billion , up 164 percent from about 28 billion last year , hollywoodcom boxoffice said the ongoing surge in ticket sales appears to show an audience drawn to diversion in tough economic times , and the growing power of the ultralarge screen and 3d technologies that pulled viewers to monsters vs aliens , and will support a number of upcoming pictures , including the science fiction thriller avatar , expected from fox and the filmmaker james cameron later this year
s handshake can be limp and his air that of a somber mortician but his words are like the red beam of a sniper s laser scope they soon may target the larcenous heart of a chicago political legend , the former alderman edward vrdolyak sitting in the federal appeals courtroom last thursday , i waited for mr posner , america s most provocative jurist , to pull the trigger finally , after all these years , the maniacally shrewd and seemingly bulletproof fast eddie vrdolyak may be carted off to the big house for two generations , walking through valleys of political death , mr vrdolyak appeared to fear no evil during his lengthy city council tenure , many aldermanic colleagues fell to prosecutions fast eddie , who faced off against mayor harold washington in the tumultuous council wars of the 1980s , emerged unscathed then , in a makeover that would impress even the arbiters on project runway , the man who once occupied the late mayor richard j daley s chair as head of the cook county democratic party was transformed into a cicero republican the mafiabride mayor of cicero , betty lorenmaltese , who paid him those fat fees , was carted off to prison , as were various minions but not fast eddie as a lawyer , he was sanctioned for misconduct , but he never wound up in prison mr vrdolyak s perpetual state of freedom seemingly underscored a comment he once made to the wbbmchannel 2 reporter mike flannery i treat everyone as though they 're wearing a wire but he was too slick by half or , better put , by 15 million , in dealing with stuart levine , the corrupt political insider at the heart of the government case against rod r blagojevich mr vrdolyak pleaded guilty in 2008 for involvement with mr levine in a 15 million kickback scheme involving the sale of a gold coast property owned by rosalind franklin university and , with houdinilike aplomb , he wound up free judge milton i shadur of federal district court stunned many by imposing a sentence of mere probation , concluding that the university had n't lost any money he also was sympathetic to presentencing letters on mr vrdolyak s behalf , none of which were initially released but when they were , they included a testimonial from a curious appraiser of personal morals , the bears linebacker brian urlacher the government appealed and last week appeared before a threejudge panel of mr posner and daniel a manion and david f hamilton , the latter being one of president obama s first judicial picks but judge manion and judge hamilton were potted plants in the dominating presence of judge posner , the prolific \( about 40 books \) and eclectic \( antitrust , sex , the bushgore election \) authorblogger termed the most mercilessly seditious legal theorist of his generation in a 2001 new yorker profile the brutal , impatient and democratic candor of the mostcited legal scholar was unceasing \( mr obama has called his onetime university of chicago law school colleague the judge he would most want to argue before \) surely , the government desired a judge other than milton shadur to resentence mr vrdolyak , judge posner declared he s made up his mind , he said the business of the letters with a person like this , you could gin up 1 , 000 letters vrdolyak took a lot of money for a corrupt purpose it s the attempt to corrupt the bidding process that s the important thing , judge posner continued if a judge takes a bribe from a litigant he was going to rule for anyway , that s still a crime , right \? he asked rhetorically fast eddie was absent eddie when his lawyer , barry spevack , argued that the scheme was to sell property at a fair market value , suggesting no harm , no foul that was derided by judge manion , who was himself fleetingly notorious when vice president george bush had to break a senate tie to win his confirmation in 1986 and judge posner , 70 , was not moved by the sympathy shown by judge shadur , 85 , for mr vrdolyak , 71 , due to the defendant s age if you get old enough , you can commit a whitecollar crime , judge posner said acidly about the mild penalty he then called an end to the proceeding , with the ruling to follow at the court s pleasure probably quickly if fasttyping judge posner writes it the only question now may be how many more books he will have written by the time mr vrdolyak loses his freedom
newark mayor described himself as a hopeless dreamer wednesday morning booker had just finished presiding over a ceremony honoring terrence kelsor , a security guard from newark who last week rescued a man who fell on the tracks as a path train was coming into the christopher street station in manhattan booker praised kelsor s courage and used him as an example of the impact citizens can have on one another booker extended the concept to the impact a professional team could have on a city in fact , he said that when he spoke of being a dreamer , he was referring to bringing to newark , the odds of which seem slim to none everyone associated with the nets' owner , bruce c ratner , insists there is no way the nets are staying in new jersey ratner s vision has always been that the team would be the crown jewel of a sprawling real estate complex in brooklyn the fact is , we 're going to brooklyn , brett yormark , the nets' chief executive , said wednesday booker is undaunted he spoke confidently about luring the nets he was passionate in describing the economic and psychic impact they would have on the city , which already has a great arena in the prudential center , where the nets will play two preseason games in october we do n't have to use state money to build anything , booker said the nets coming to newark would supercharge the city i'm working on it every day he added , we think it s the right thing for the state , it s the right thing for the team and it actually makes sense still , ratner is determined to give brooklyn a pro basketball team whether the borough wants one or not so a franchise that has been searching for an identity , for a true home , is once again at a crossroads newark desperately wants the nets brooklyn has been lukewarm the nets want lukewarm from the moment ratner announced plans to move the team to brooklyn , the project has encountered wave after wave of protest using money , influence and political muscle , ratner has waded through resistance the way a fighter wades through punches in hopes of landing a knockout blow there have been victories along the way , but no peace in early february , a major lender agreed to extend its loan and not demand full payment , which was due that month late last month , a state appellate court ruled against opponents who had challenged the 4 billion project on environmental grounds another major decision remaining is a lawsuit challenging the state s use of eminent domain to seize private property on behalf of the project a defeat could be devastating for the project , which is already reeling from the poor economy the nets , meanwhile , who struggled to draw fans when they were going to the nba finals , are again relying on opposing teams' stars to draw newark could help stop the bleeding the team is hemorrhaging money , booker said i can show bruce tomorrow how bringing the team to newark will stop the hemorrhaging the team is doing right now in the event ratner eventually wants to sell , booker is looking at ownership groups willing to bring the nba to newark i am talking to some people who are interested , he said i know that we can show them that this can be a moneymaking team he would n't be more specific there s a lot of talk , he said last may , ratner said the nets were not on the market but that was before a global economic tsunami hit still , with sponsors on board , there would seem to be no sentiment to sell the nets have eight founding partners and it is believed they will be announcing a ninth next week corporate america believes in the project , the barclays center specifically , yormark said , referring to the proposed brooklyn arena they know we 're going to get there , and they want to be a part of it but newark is a good fit for the nets it is a city with a roughandtumble past and a promising future most important , it would give the nets an identity , something they have lacked for decades there is a compelling socialjustice argument to make , that this team coming here will have a multiplier effect of social good in our city , booker said newark is really a basketball city this is something that should be here for the team to leave new jersey is ridiculous meanwhile , ratner , whose company , forest city ratner , was the development partner for the midtown headquarters for the new york times company , continues to nip and tuck and shrink his grand development project in deference to a ravaged economy , he said he would build the basketball arena first and hold off on proposed office buildings and most of the housing until the economy improves according to reports , he is trying to cut the estimated 1 billion cost of the arena in half in the hope of attracting financing and attracting more city and state subsidies newark would be so easy unfortunately , that s never been the nets' way the struggle always continues
away from the constant commotion of the , jowilfried tsonga likes to spend his evenings at a kitschy french bistro in midtown manhattan called tout va bien , french for all is well and with a spot booked in the third round of the open , tsonga can hardly complain about the way the tournament is going for him neither can some of his favorite dinner companions , ga l monfils , gilles simon and josselin ouanna monfils and simon are in the third round , too the four make up perhaps the most talented crop of french players in a long time all younger than 25 , they are prompting chatter about the first grand slam title for a frenchman since yannick noah won at roland garros in 1983 you have to go back to noah , henri leconte and thierry tulasne in the 1980s for a generation like this one , said c dric pioline , the former french no 1 , who is currently in charge of elite men s development at the french tennis federation this generation has been a decade in the making tsonga , monfils , simon and ouanna have known each other since they were youngsters who happened to hit a tennis ball that much harder and that much cleaner than most and more than just encounter each other at junior tournaments all over france , they have roomed together while navigating the rigorous structure of french sporting academies these guys , they 're like my brothers , said monfils , seeded 13th at the open we 're all extremely close it s tough to describe what it is because we 've just always known each other it s always been the way until the last few years , the french tennis scene had been distinctly devoid of stars s bastien grosjean rose to no 4 in the world and was a mainstay at grand slam events for the last decade , and arnaud cl ment peaked with an australian open final appearance in 2001 but tsonga and monfils led the charge for french tennis s strikingly quick youth movement monfils was the first of the four to break into the top 50 and qualified for the semifinals of the last year in january , tsonga went one better , reaching the australian open final more than delivering results , they are doing it with entertaining tennis ga l and jo have some serious charisma , ouanna said it s a nice change it s like when noah was playing and everyone knew his face monfils , with his teased hair , gregarious personality and captivating athleticism , is the consummate showman at roland garros , he whipped up the crowd with a dance routine inspired by the rapper soulja boy off the court , he decorates his sneakers with rhinestones and gold marker , always signing them with his nickname , la monf and after knocking off andreas beck in the open s second round on friday , he paid homage to his hero muhammad ali by throwing four quick jabs at the baseline and finishing with an uppercut then he paid homage to himself by tracing the bulge of his exposed biceps with his racket i'm just being natural , being me , monfils said i love being in front of a crowd when it s buzzing tsonga puts on a different kind of show and he never dances with sheer power and a rugby player s build , the 6foot2 , 200pound tsonga brutalizes opponents , always wearing his emotions on his sleeve he swaggers , he yells on the court , and with a wave of the arms , he turns up the volume wherever he plays i actually like to kid around and laugh , and on the court i do like to put on a show , said tsonga , the seventh seed but i do n't have that actor side like ga l simon , seeded ninth , is more reserved on the court and mutters to himself ouanna seems downright shy but even with their wide range of personalities , the four grew up as one another s support network in france , young athletes are selected early to leave home for what is known as a sport tudes programs , meant to develop elite athletes in all sports so after long days split between the classroom and the practice courts , monfils , tsonga , simon and ouanna counted on one another to preserve some modicum of balance in their lives we could hang out with each other like human beings , normal people who do n't play tennis all day , tsonga said even so , simon said , little was normal about the situation we did whatever we could to make it as fun as possible , and none of us regrets our choices , he said but in no way was it what teenagers are used to experiencing for years , the four pushed each other to be better , without a trace of jealousy even as coaches who made careers dealing in broken dreams constantly reminded them that perhaps only one would make it to the big time , they kept driving forward , each at his own pace we all stayed tight growing up , and i think that as each of us got better , we pulled the others , tsonga said subconsciously , it was always about keeping up when one of us was playing well now on the professional tour , where each player travels with coaches , trainers , agents and hangerson , they still stumble through the crowds of the open to keep an eye on each other if the top 100 could be entirely made up of my buddies , simon said , it would be a lot more fun
ameen abdul kareem mohammed , 21 , looks younger than his years he is smaller than most of the other 30 men standing with him in a hall at the baquba jail in diyala province waiting for the paperwork so that they can walk free until a few days ago the men were detainees at camp bucca , the largest of the american detention centers in iraq as the american troops draw down , they are slowly sending home the detainees that have not been charged with any crimes that means most of them the detention population has dropped already to not quite 15 , 000 from a high of close to 26 , 000 the plan is to release 1 , 500 each month until there are none left and the americans can close both camp bucca in the southern iraqi desert and camp cropper , on the edge of baghdad they hope to leave both by the end of the year mr mohammed is one of those being released even his family does not yet know he is on his way home he was allowed only to tell them he was coming to baghdad for security reasons despite never having been charged with a crime and losing a year of his life while he waited for the americans to conclude he should no longer be held , he expresses surprisingly little rancor towards his jailers america s future credibility in iraq will depend a lot on people like mr mohammed , and the message they carry home to their family and friends if he truly believes that on balance detention under the americans was better than the alternative that is detention under the shiitedominated iraqi government then sometime in the future the americans will have a chance to become trusted brokers between sectarian and ethnic groups but if people like mr mohammed believe the americans humiliated and demeaned him , he will only ratify the worst image of the americans , making it unlikely there will be much of a place for them in iraq for now , mr mohammed seems to still be working out what he thinks much of it was good but there was that lost year the treatment was good at bucca there was no torture or beating i went to school when we left they gave each detainee a holy koran , he said , as he shyly holds up a plastic bag with the holy book inside it several other detainees hold up their korans as well how did he come to be a detainee \? there had been an attack nearby on coalition forces it was night and my two brothers and i were talking and three soldiers came to the door with an interpreter the interpreter talked to my father and said we want your eldest son and your youngest son the accusation was that we had attacked coalition forces did he \? he shakes his head no and smiles faintly as if to say this is one of those benighted american ideas mr mohammed is the first to be given the official release form , signed by a baquba police officer he can present it to his employer to prove he was in detention and not just a slacker , avoiding work that should allow him to collect his back salary he holds it carefully , then slides it into plastic bag with his koran i was at bucca for one year and twenty days i had two visits from my family there was no evidence it was a very long time , but what shall i do \? he shrugged
doing exactly what he needed to all weekend , sebastian vettel scored pole position and drove a perfect race in his red bull to win the japanese grand prix and reignite his challenge for the drivers title , as the series leader struggled again to score any points at all indeed , jenson button , continued his downhill slide at the roller coaster of a track in suzuka , not only by finishing only eighth and losing nine points to vettel , but by finishing one spot behind rubens barrichello , his teammate at the brawn team , who is second in the drivers series vettel is now 16 points from the leader with two races and a maximum of 20 points left to take beaming with delight after the race , vettel pointed out that this was a similar situation to what happened in 2007 when kimi raikkonen overcame a 17point deficit in his ferrari with two races left to win the title over lewis hamilton in a mclaren mercedes it was the third victory of the season for vettel and the fourth of his career it can still be done , it s looking much better now , said vettel of his chances at challenging for the title it s a shame there are only two races to go we ll see what we can do , he added we ll focus on us , on ourselves , simply focus to win i will surely keep pushing jarno trulli finished the race second in his toyota , 48 seconds behind vettel , and hamilton finished third for mclaren button leads the series with 85 points , barrichello is second with 71 and vettel is third with 69 the brawn team leads the constructors championship with 156 points to 1205 for red bull , while ferrari is third with 67 points but after saturday afternoon produced the wildest qualifying session in years with three relatively serious accidents , expectations were high for an exciting , but dangerous race as the formula one drivers returned to one of their favorite circuits for the first time since 2006 but vettel sped away from his pole position with little problem , successfully fending off a small attack by hamilton hamilton briefly nosed ahead of vettel , but the german had a positional advantage it was closer than i thought it would be going into turn 1 , vettel said all of a sudden i saw a silver arrow going in but i had the inside hamilton did manage to pass trulli , however , to move into second it wasn t our best start , but this year we re not happy with our starts , said hamilton and it was not a very long straight to turn 1 i tried , but unfortunately the outside is not a good place to be trulli would later regain his second position through pit stop strategy , and indeed , while there were a number of changes of position up and down the pack , through both ontrack moves and pit stops , the suzuka circuit in southwest japan produced little more than a procession for nearly all of the 53 laps of the race in the end , there would be only one serious accident , and no further injuries than the gash on his left leg that timo glock got in his accident during qualifying and which prevented the german driver from taking part in the race in the other toyota the accident that looked as if it would finally draw the race to life came nine laps from the end when jaime alguersuari in a toro rosso ran into a barrier and destroyed his car , sending debris across the track the safety car was deployed to allow track marshals to clean the mess before the interruption , vettel had led by more than 12 seconds on trulli and hamilton was third suddenly , it looked as if everything was up for grabs as the cars bunched up behind the safety car and all the drivers prepared to attack as soon as the race restarted when you re leading by more than 10 seconds it s the last thing you hope for , said vettel of the safety car deployment but vettel had romain grosjean in a renault behind him and protecting him from the threat from trulli the race resumed with only four laps left , and despite a few attempts by robert kubica in a bmw sauber to pass button , the order did not change , as none of the drivers appeared ready to risk everything for a point or two more button won the first six of seven races this year , but has not won a race since the turkish grand prix on june 7 and his lead in the championship has been steadily diminishing the circuit , a long , narrow , winding and rolling track next to an amusement park is a favorite of most of the drivers when i went into the last lap i was regretting a bit that it was over , said vettel i was enjoying again the first sector for the last time simply fantastic this circuit , and if you get 53 laps more you appreciate it even more it s made by god s hands
one of our regulars in the comments section , walt bennett , says it s time for the jets to tell the gunslinger to put the pistol in the holster and walk away by walt bennett over at the jets web site is a multimedia gallery , and i check it out every couple of days today i watched the nfl network roundtable discussion regarding the hiring of rex ryan as head coach , and all four participants quickly agreed that the no 1 issue for coach ryan is the brett favre situation i couldn t agree more ryan has to find a way to tactfully tell a legend that it s time to retire don t even give favre the chance to offer his services for 2009 i m sure that woody johnson would be happy to giftwrap the deal with some buyout money , and that seems fair consider this the baltimore ravens went into the conference title game with a firstyear quarterback because they had two things rex ryan s defense and a running game and consider also this favre probably ruined eric mangini s tenure in new york , because mangini didn t have the courage to bench an obviously struggling starter when the team desperately needed wins , and thus lost whatever authority over the team that he once had does ryan need to be burdened with an aging rock star in his first season \? a living statue \? i loved the idea of bringing favre in , and if he had won , mangini would still be coach and none of this would matter but favre failed , and he looked very bad while doing it he absolutely cost mangini his job in more than one way he could very easily poison the rex ryan regime right out of the gate that would be unacceptable mr johnson brought in the right man , and that man needs to have complete authority over his team he needs to be the one to decide who stays and who goes ryan said all the right things in his first press conference he referred to favre as a legend and extolled favre s exploits against him on the nfl network , however , he listed several priority items that would come ahead of calling favre and said that he would not beg favre to come back ryan will succeed only to the extent that he always does what he thinks he should do he should remember that coaches such as bill parcells had to learn the hard way that you can t please everyone he can learn from his own father that if you win , they ll love you no matter what sort of personality you have that s especially true in new york consider that kellen clemens spent a season under favre s wing and had shown promise as a starter consider that brett ratliff , who will be in his second pro season , is considered to have star potential give ryan a minicamp and a training camp with the two of them , and let him pick a starter for the season that quarterback s job will be to execute a very methodical , groundbased game , with occasional strikes downfield joe flacco showed how well that plan can work in baltimore this past season if ryan believes that either clemens or ratliff shows enough skill in camp to deliver that type of performance , then he doesn t need favre or anyone else to run his offense at the end of the roundtable clip from the nfl network , adam schefter said that there was no way that ryan could go into camp with a plan to choose between clemens and ratliff he suggested that the jets could bring in , for example , a rex grossman that would be rex grossman , who was benched in chicago for gross ineffectiveness how absurd is that \? rex ryan was brought in to build a certain type of team the brett favre of a couple of years ago might very well have been the right man to run ryan s offense , but there is no way that a firstyear coach should gamble his success on an aging veteran who may or may not have something left in the tank in my view , ryan will be far better off going with one of his young guns and making a commitment to developing this young , talented squad in his image it says here , that s exactly what mr johnson brought him here to do
it has become an inevitable part of the selection sunday ritual almost immediately after the ncaa men s basketball tournament bracket is revealed , pundits and fans start debating whether deserving teams from conferences known as midmajors were unfairly excluded from the field of 65 in favor of teams from one of the power conferences proponents of midmajor basketball will have plenty to squawk about this year , as only 4 of the 34 atlarge bids went to teams from outside the six top conferences \( atlantic coast , big 12 , big east , big ten , pacific10 and southeastern \) that is down from six in 2007 and 2008 , and the fewest atlarge berths for midmajors since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985 among the most conspicuously snubbed were st mary s of the west coast conference , creighton of the missouri valley conference and san diego state of the mountain west conference despite those arguable sins of omission , the selection committee may have inadvertently done a favor for the midmajor conferences and true college basketball connoisseurs by creating several compelling firstround matchups between the elite conferences and the lesserknowns how does the class of the mountain west compare with a middling team from the pac10 \? a firstround game in the midwest region pits fifthseeded utah \( 249 \) against 12thseeded arizona \( 1913 \) that is just one of nine firstround matchups that will allow the debate to take place on the court in the west region , 11thseeded utah state \( 246 \) , a perennial power in the western athletic conference , will have the chance against marquette , from the big east , this year s glamour conference with seven tournament teams , including three no 1 seeds this year , all but 9 of the 32 teams seeded between no 5 and no 12 hail from the six major conferences of the nine midmajor teams in that group , none is scheduled to play another midmajor in the first round that is a significant shift from 2007 and 2008 , when a high number of midmajors were slotted to play one another last year , 8 of the 13 midmajor teams seeded between no 5 and no 12 were slated to play one another , including drakewestern kentucky and davidsongonzaga the majority of midmajors were not given the chance to show they could hold their own against powerconference teams mike slive , the commissioner of the sec and chairman of this year s selection committee , said that the designation of major versus midmajor was an arbitrary one and that the committee did not consider conference affiliation when ranking the tournament teams from 1 to 65 , or when placing teams in the bracket according to those rankings we actually do n't see the brackets until all of the seeding is done and the bracket is then put out , slive said on a conference call sunday night some years , maybe it turned out one way this year , it turns out another but it s based upon the quality of the teams in that year , where they end up where they have ended up in 2009 is ideal for viewers who like to watch lowerprofile programs play for validation on the national stage with firstround matchups like ohio statesiena , west virginiadayton and illinoiswestern kentucky , this year s tournament could be a reprise of 2006 , when six midmajors beat majorconference teams in the first round , four won secondround games over powerconference teams , and george mason of the colonial athletic association made a run to the final four as the prognosticators work to identify this year s potential george masons , many may lament the low number of midmajors in the field but at least the few midmajors that did make it into the tournament will not be facing each other on thursday and friday

mattered greatly to ultraconservatives because the new secretary of state , alexander m haig jr , had not included ideological hardliners in his policymaking team at the state department dr lefever told the senate committee on foreign relations that the united states had no right or power to promote human rights in other sovereign states , a direct refutation of carter policy and he drew a sharp distinction between oppression by communist and other brutal governments , speaking out much more strongly against communism his confirmation hearings were far from smooth for him when senators asked dr lefever about a statement in 1979 to the house foreign affairs committee that all human rights standards should be repealed , he replied that he had goofed to the same committee , he excused the use of torture by the military junta in chile as a residual practice of the iberian tradition and dr lefever insisted he had not said that people opposed to his nomination were inspired by communists

nestl sa , a manufacturer of infant formula , which had given more than 25 , 000 in grants to the center critics said the center had helped promote the sale of infant formula , which was a

york times on june 16 , 1981 , dr lefever acknowledged that his center had reprinted an article on nestl by a fortune magazine editor , but said the article was critical of nestl for aggressive

mermaids ahoy ! dvorak s rusalka \( 1901 \) returns to the repertory on march 9 revived george balanchine s oneact swan lake in february \( it returns in may \) and at the end of march both the royal ballet and american ballet theater will play their fulllength productions of swan lake in simultaneous performances in nearby opera houses in london \( ballet theater s returns to the metropolitan opera house in june \) on broadway the disney run of the little mermaid continues what do these different stage dramas have in common \? they all derive from the same short novel , undine \( 1811 \) by friedrich de la motte fouqu each is about a heroine who , though partly or wholly an animal of the water , longs to belong to the human race and to have \( as humans do \) an eternal soul and about a hero whose love for her is powerful but flawed the story takes on a different quality in each telling each time , however , it touches on the psychopathology of sexual relations legends about undines , rusalkas , mermaids , sirens , ladies of the lake go back to ancient mythology some of them , in the way they give their heroines fishlike lower bodies , probably express aspects of misogyny and horror of female libido but a fresh wave of these mermyths started when fouqu published undine this still goes in and out of print throughout the 19th century it inspired operas , paintings , ballets , poems , instrumental music , sculptures and other fiction in huldebrand , fouqu created a romantic hero for whom this world is not enough he has a human fianc e , but he finds what he craves in the affections of undine , a water nymph who lacks a soul it s a classic expression of adulterous desire , blown up into elemental terms huldebrand wants undine because she s unholdable , impalpable he is human \( and chivalrous \) , but she is water liquid and refreshing on one hand on the other , a destructive embodiment of chaos depth of emotion in fouqu s tale all belongs to the hero it took later artists alexander pushkin in his dramatic poem rusalka \( 1832 , though unfinished \) and hans christian andersen in his story the little mermaid \( 1837 \) to see the story principally from the heroine s point of view pushkin himself had trifled with many women , in one case making a serf girl pregnant now , in rusalka , he looked through those women s eyes his heroine , jilted by a prince , drowns herself in the river dnieper the prince , unhappy in his marriage , returns to the river where he knew happiness with her she is now a rusalka , a water spirit in revenge she sends their daughter , a rusalochka , to lure him into the water pushkin s story , however , ends just as the prince confronts this apparition andersen s little mermaid knows no such sense of revenge he was to create other otherworldly heroines the snow queen , the ice maiden who heartlessly break up human relationships but his mermaid is , instead , one of the supreme embodiments of pathos she wants a human soul she wants the love of the prince she has spotted through his cabin porthole to gain a human form even though she is told every step you take will feel like you are stepping on a sharp knife that makes you bleed she sacrifices her voice though she becomes dear to him when she is a voiceless human , he still takes another woman as his bride the mermaid s sisters urge her to save her life by killing him instead , she throws away their knife and lets herself dissolve into foam the anguish andersen s mermaid endures the bleeding , the voicelessness may have expressed several aspects of 19thcentury womanhood , not all of which have vanished today her longing and resignation also surely expressed andersen s own feelings as a repressed homosexual and with the intensity he gave it , the undinemermaid myth gained new vehemence many composers now depicted waternymph heroines in opera among them , the homosexual tchaikovsky in undina \( 1869 \) and the heterosexual dvorak in rusalka though tchaikovsky composed undina with passion and enthusiasm , it was never performed later he decided that this was for the best he destroyed the score but he reused several of its musical items in new contexts , none to better effect than the love duet for undina and huldebrand in 1877 he rearranged it at the center of the drama of his ballet swan lake , with the two solo voices now taken by violin and cello , and it contains the most sublime and most intimate moments of this most celebrated of all ballets odette , the heroine of swan lake , belongs to three elements by day she is the queen of the swans , belonging to air and water and , less gracefully , to dry earth by night , which is when we see her in the ballet , she is a human being of great beauty , dressed in the white that may symbolize not only her swan condition but also her virginity love can save her if a man will love her faithfully , she will not be a swan anymore there s no doubt that this existential bind agonizes odette in the traditional version of the ballet she explains it to the ballet s hero , prince siegfried , within the first two minutes of meeting him and there s no doubt that she hopes he will be the one whose love will free her in the best romantichero tradition he obliges by promptly declaring his love then , like all too many other romantic heroes , he swears love the very next day to another woman , admittedly in the belief that she is odette \( this is not too unreasonable when the other woman is played by the same ballerina , as usually happens \) yet several things about the love between odette and siegfried in swan lake are peculiar she needs him to love her yet at no point does she say she loves him her behavior leads us to assume that she feels tenderness for him but what she s urgent about is freedom when he proves faithless , we do n't know whether he has broken her heart we do know that he has wrecked her chances of escape from her swan fate it s fair to think that while he keeps showing his devotion to her in the pas de deux to the undina music , her own feelings are close to what wagner s flying dutchman sings in the comparable scene in that opera should i call this love \? no it is the longing for redemption odette , like so many 19thcentury protagonists , wants redemption but how badly \? odette , for all her hope of freedom , is the most diffident of ballet heroines again and again in that pas de deux she keeps withdrawing from his embrace , falling \( almost fainting \) away from his touch , retreating to corners of the stage in which she feels safe if you read odette s conflict of feeling in sexual terms , this becomes one of the most profound malefemale duets in drama odette s feelings for this man are divided she wants him , and she fears him she wants release from her current condition , and she wants to remain in its sanctuary it s at least possible to see this as a metaphor for a woman s divided feelings about the loss of virginity , to sense even a reluctant frigidity in her dvorak s rusalka , one of the most heartrending heroines in all of opera , is divided the same way the librettist jaroslav kvapil drew on andersen s little mermaid for inspiration and he went beyond andersen in probing the reasons the prince cannot find satisfying love with rusalka she gives up her voice to become human , but that amazingly in an opera is not his main problem why is your embrace so cold \? he asks why are you so afraid to surrender to passion \? and again , i have to make you mine , completely mine , no matter how cold and diffident you are this is astonishing we know \( he does n't \) that she has defied her folk , has changed race and has sacrificed her voice and tongue , all for love of him yet some inner part of her cannot yield to him unheard by him , she says , i was born of cool water , and such passion is alien to me passion and sensuality are what she recognizes in her rival , the foreign princess , and in them she sees her own defeat like the little mermaid she returns to the water her kinfolk urge her to save herself by stabbing the prince she becomes a roaming phantom the prince returns to the water s edge and to her , aware too late \( like the princes of both pushkin s rusalka and tchaikovsky s swan lake \) that he was never happier than with her her kiss , she warns him , can now only bring him death that , he replies , is all he now wants and she gives him it the hero in these dramas is caught between two loves between this heroine from another species and a woman of his own kind the heroine in each case has a second figure in her life too \( rothbart in swan lake , the water goblin in rusalka \) usually he is male , a sorcerer and a father figure almost invariably he embodies repression especially in this figure , of course , these stories were ripely ready for freud hero and heroine seem to be facing each other across an unbridgeable abyss he wants her because she is out of his world she cannot fully give herself to him for that very reason each is torn in two there is one further classic 19thcentury treatment of this myth ibsen s play the lady from the sea \( 1888 \) ellida , the heroine here , is married to the country doctor wangel but she is haunted by a man from her past , a nameless stranger who has journeyed away \( another flying dutchman \) but who believes he and she have married themselves to the sea she loves her husband , but she tells him that she cannot give herself to him the mariner from her past is ibsen s version of the sorcerer figure of the rusalka myth ellida s fear of , and attraction to , him control her thoughts and no play of this era comes closer to freudian psychoanalysis in the final scene dr wangel gives his wife liberty she is free to leave him as she chooses with this act she finds that the stranger s power over her suddenly vanishes once given independence she finds she can for the first time reject both her former lover and the sea here ibsen anticipates feminism give a woman freedom , and you end much of the repression that has hitherto marked her existence but as long as repression remains , these other mermyths will hold sway and as we follow these dramas of the loves between princes and rusalkas , mermaids , swanmaidens , we do n't just respond to the human side we 're made also to recognize the part of us that feels alien the part of us that swims outside humanity and looks in at it longingly through a porthole
ryan giggs and park jisung each scored goals to lead manchester united a comfortable 20 win at middlesbrough on saturday and extend its lead in the english premier league to 6 points with four games remaining united , the defending champion , was unruffled by a boro team that offered surprisingly little fight considering it is in grave danger of being relegated it would now take a monumental collapse by manager alex ferguson s united for it to miss winning its 18th title in later games , chelsea and arsenal kept alive their fading hopes with wins chelsea dispatched fulham , 31 , and arsenal won at portsmouth , 30 we are whittling the games away , said ferguson , whose team has 80 points from 34 games compared to liverpool s 74 newcastle united , which is also in danger of being relegated , plays at liverpool on sunday it s a big step forward today there s only four games left and eventually there will be none , and hopefully we 'll still be top of the league , ferguson said united was without the injured rio ferdinand , and ferguson rested cristiano ronaldo , edwin van der sar and michael carrick in advance of tuesday s champions league semifinal second leg at arsenal manchester united holds a 10 lead in the homeandhome , totalgoals series once we got in front , that sealed the victory , ferguson said middlesbrough are a young side , and once they had to chase the game it opened it up for us really boro began well and could have gone in front before giggs scored when jeremie aliadiere s shot was saved by ben foster giggs , voted england s player of the year by his peers in the professional footballers' association last week , showed his skill when he put united in front when the ball came to him at the edge of the penalty area , the 35yearold giggs looked up , picked his spot and drilled a low shot past boro s helpless keeper , brad jones jones almost provided united with a second goal when he cleared the ball straight to dimitar berbatov , who set up paul scholes , but scholes shot wide boro could hardly get a kick at the start of the second half , and a fluid passing move ended with wayne rooney s reverse pass springing park to shoot past jones the rest of the match was a lesson in possession by united as it conserved energy for tuesday while boro wilted the defeat left boro in second to last place with 31 points and only three games remaining newcastle is above it on goal difference , while hull , which plays at aston villa on monday , has 34 uli hoeness , the bayern munich team manager , said that louis van gaal , who won this season s dutch championship with az alkmaar , was one of the club s possible replacements for j rgen klinsmann as coach klinsmann , the former coach of germany s national team , was fired at bayern last monday after only 10 months in charge van gaal , 57 , has been mentioned as a possible replacement , along with two other dutchmen , martin jol and frank rijkaard van gaal is one of the candidates we are interested in , hoeness told the sueddeutsche zeitung before adding that there is a list of possible candidates bayern s bosses want to have coach their side according to the munich newspaper , bayern has already contacted van gaal , who is under contract with az alkmaar until 2011 van gaal , who has a reputation for discipline , has coached top european clubs like as ajax , which he guided to champions league success in 1995 , and barcelona as well as the dutch national team bayern has jupp heynckes as caretaker coach for the last five league games of the season and was third in the bundesliga , 3 points behind firstplace wolfsburg , after both clubs won their games on saturday but hoeness said bayern , the defending bundesliga champion , was determined to find a germanspeaking coach as a matter of priority it is an enormous handicap if the trainer must constantly pass on his ideas through a translator , hoeness said there are only a few cases , for example rafael ben tez at liverpool , who would make you rethink , but he is not available scott mcdonald scored two goals as glasgow celtic handed aberdeen its first home defeat in six months , 31 the win gave celtic a 4point lead in the scottish premier league celtic will be top of the league heading into next week s old firm derby match at ibrox regardless of the result in the game between rangers and hearts on sunday

throughout the jets' locker room monday , the answers did not match the record the rookie quarterback mark sanchez sounded giddy linebacker bart scott remained defiant player after player expressed satisfaction with his respective individual or unit performance halfway through this season none of that changed the bottom line , the string of uneven play , fixing one leak to find another , the 44 record those scattered performances produced the jets head into their bye week with the nfl s topranked rushing attack and a defense that stands second in fewest yards and fourth in fewest points allowed per game , before monday s game in the offseason , in training camp and into september and october , many jets sounded like professional wrestlers , creating expectations they have failed to live up to they placed that target on their back , and when they started this season 30 , those already raised expectations shot even higher by doing so , safety kerry rhodes said the jets opened themselves to criticism when they won , the bragging and boasting and bravado seemed endearing when they lost , it seemed misplaced on nbc on sunday night , tony dungy , the super bowlwinning coach , addressed that topic , even quoting his mother , who he said told him when you win , say very little when you lose , say less to which ryan responded monday i was brought up differently we 're not going to get anywhere by tiptoeing greg bishop
tobi umodu is a junior fullback for the ucla bruins he is blogging for the quad periodically during the season throughout my football career i have played for a lot of different coaches at a number of different levels none of the coaches i played for had any national prominence or had a name that caused peoples eyes to light up when they heard it , but that all changed when norm chow became our offensive coordinator at ucla there are many coaches in college football that are famous for their particular style frank beamer at virginia tech is known for his great special teams and joe paterno at penn state is known for his tough , hardnosed defenses , but when it comes to offense , norm chow is definitely one of the first names that comes to mind when i found out he was coming to our university i was really excited our offense really needed to improve and it seemed that having a coach like him was just what we needed to get ourselves back on track i don t really get star struck at all , but i had missed a meeting because i had to take care of some personal issues back at home and he wanted to meet with me to talk to me about switching over to offense the first time i happened to meet him was while i was in the bathroom near our football office i remember thinking , man it s really norm chow , i don t even know what to say to him eventually i got over it and just asked him when he would like to meet with me and everything was good from there for those people who never heard of norm chow or are wondering what makes him such a special coach , he was the mastermind behind quarterbacks carson palmer and matt leinart when they were at usc and helped vince young become the nfl s offensive rookie of the year while he was an assistant for the tennessee titans but to fully explain what makes him so effective as a coach will take a little bit more than naming a couple of highlights on his resume to me a leader is someone who is able to instill their values in the people they are leading and help them develop the skills they need to move forward and be successful the main thing coach chow tries to teach us is attention to detail he knows that if we do all the little things right everything else will take care of itself whether it is finishing a play all the way through the whistle at practice , knowing where you are supposed to be on a certain play , or making sure you actually execute the play correctly instead of trying to do it your own way because you think it s better , he is always harping on us to focus on those things if we can do those little things the right way he knows that when it comes to the game where the stakes are a lot higher , we will be able to do it without worrying about anything another aspect of him he tries to pass on to us is his genuine passion for the game we don t really get to seem him too much during the game , except for before the game and at halftime , but at practice it is a different story he is always the most animated person out there during practice it could be him trying to get us hyped up for practice , wanting us to put more effort into a play , or just being excited about how a play worked out whatever it is , his main goal is to tryto get us to love the game as much as he does and to try and have fun while we are out there instead of dragging our feet like we are someplace we don t want to be something he always says is that we don t work football , we play football so we shouldn t be looking at football like a job we have to do instead it s a blessing that we are able to go out and play the great game of football while there are many others who would like to , but can t what i admire the most about coach chow is how much he cares about the players he coaches he is one of the coaches that you know has your back even if the problem you are having doesn t have anything to do with football coaching is more than a 9to5 job to him he loves being around us , joking with us , or just talking to us about being more than just a good football player , but also being a good man i don t know if i ll ever be able to play football at the next level , so my time at ucla might be the last football years i have , but even if they are i m glad i got to spend a few of my football years playing for coach chow
washington it was not the fullforce , letathousandsaxophonesbloom , thisisourmusic festival that some might have wished from a white house where the language of jazz seems to have a place , at least in the president s ipod but it was a good start on monday afternoon , invited about 150 high school jazz students to the white house for a program called jazz studio there was a student clinic including five members of the marsalis family and the clarinetist paquito d'rivera , and then a short concert introduced by the first lady before some readers begin feeling too righteous , it s important to know that the event was n't a pure , standalone expression of love for jazz it was the first in a series of three very different musical events in the white house this year so if the short afternoon event was largely symbolic for those on the sidelines , quickly and easily establishing the notion that the new administration is interested in musical genres other than country , it was a useful , practical event for the students the young musicians were divided into three groups of 50 , and the workshop themes were american history and jazz , syntax of jazz , the blues experience and jazz and duke ellington and swing other workshop leaders included the saxophonist todd williams , the trumpeter sean jones and the pianist eli yamin the event was organized in conjunction with the duke ellington school of the arts and the duke ellington jazz festival in washington , jazz at lincoln center in new york city , the thelonious monk institute of jazz and several other institutions the marsalises especially wynton and his father , ellis are born teachers , and , at least during the part of their hourlong clinic that journalists were allowed to watch , they packed important , basic lessons about jazz history and practice into short spaces the students drank it in , and the teachers beamed after the elder mr marsalis talked for a while about individual expression in jazz and the birth of swing rhythm , the students traded 12bar improvisations with the master musicians on a blues tune and then doled out bits of advice , without aiming them at particular players the advice never slink off looking mad at yourself after your solo , do n't abuse the rhythm section and play shorter the blues forces us to feel vocal elements in our playing , mr marsalis said , and it keeps us from going here he played a fast , ripping , showoff improvisation that was n't vocal at all now , i'm going to play , and branford is going to imitate the students quickly jumped in none were virtuosos some , including a trumpeter from new york , ivan rosenberg , were quite good perhaps sensing a competitive spirit , mr marsalis pushed mr rosenberg into smeared , highly expressive whines finally he played a whinnying phrase that trailed into fast , articulated notes i ca n't do that , man , mr rosenberg said , laughing and backing off sharing a stage with wynton marsalis , who teaches constantly on the road , is not out of the realm of possibility for a gifted young jazz musician but doing it at the white house can make you starryeyed that was crazy , said phillip slyde , an able 17yearold alto saxophonist who played questionandanswer with mr d'rivera he came up from new orleans the day before , he said he was recuperating from nerves , in the expectant hush before mrs obama s arrival kyle wedberg , the president of his school , the new orleans center for creative arts , appeared behind him this says that normal , everyday americans have a place in this white house , versus people that have some leverage to get in here , mr wedberg said , breathlessly we changed 14 lives today that s amazing it s a great use of this public facility in her fourminute speech , mrs obama brushed across two wellknown thoughts about jazz that it may be america s greatest gift to the world and that there is no better example of democracy than a jazz ensemble but she basically made way for the closing concert , which put mr d'rivera and mr marsalis in front of a young band , including the pianist tony madruga and the saxophonist elijah easton mr d'rivera played embroidered versions of famous jazz melodies on the clarinet , encouraging the student audience to guess their titles and composers when he played a famous dizzy gillespie phrase , the audience including mrs obama , seated in the front row with her daughters answered promptly with the correct response salt peanuts , salt peanuts ahhh ! mr d'rivera shouted , looking extremely pleased michelle knows it ! the next event in the white house music series , with details to be announced later in the summer , will focus on country music
the hit men moved in on their target , shot him dead and then disappeared in a matter of seconds it would have been a perfect case for jos \? barra lim \? one of this violent border city s most dogged crime investigators had he not been the victim mexico has never been particularly adept at bringing criminals to justice , and the drug war has made things worse investigators are now swamped with homicides and other drug crimes , most of which they will never crack on top of the standard obstacles too little expertise , too much corruption is one that seems to grow by the day outright fear of becoming the next body in the street mr ibarra was killed on july 27 in what his bosses at the federal attorney general s office consider an assassination related to a case he was investigating as if to prove the point , less than a month later , one of the lawyers who had worked for mr ibarra also turned up dead two days afterward , an investigator named to replace mr ibarra insisted on being transferred out of ciudad ju \? z , mexico s murder capital the current prosecutor investigating mr ibarra s cases is working anonymously , his or her name kept secret by the government the mexican government knows that revamping its problemplagued justice system is an essential part of breaking the cartels that control vast areas of mexico major efforts are under way to make the judiciary faster and fairer , and the united states has contributed millions of dollars to help bring more criminals to justice but even with training programs by american lawyers and judges , american aid to improve forensics and screen more effectively for corruption , as well as other crossborder initiatives , the traffickers and the cumulative pressures they are putting on the judiciary are straining it as never before obviously what happened affects us , said hector garc \? rodr \? ez , the federal prosecutor in ju \? z and the supervisor of the slain investigator we 're still working we ca n't stop but we know the dangers we face president felipe calder \? oints to the arrests of more than 50 , 000 people on drug charges since he began his antidrug offensive in december 2006 many of the arrests appear to have come from topnotch detective work other suspects , though , are quietly released after they have been paraded before the news media the federal government refused to provide statistics on how many arrests had resulted in convictions , how many suspects were still under investigation or how many arrests had proved to be mistakes but independent reviews by scholars suggest that only about a quarter of crimes in mexico are ever reported and that only a small fraction ever result in convictions compounding matters is the sheer number of crimes , especially murders on a single september night in ciudad ju \? z , 18 men were shot to death in a drug treatment center near the border , more than the number of killings all year long in el paso , just across the texas border law enforcement is overwhelmed , said david a shirk , a professor at the university of san diego and the principal investigator for the justice in mexico project , a binational research initiative if you have murders with 13 bodies one day and then you have 4 more the next , there s not a lot of investigation into who pulled the trigger specifically fear gets in the way one of the two dozen or so cases that mr ibarra had been investigating involved the killing of a journalist , armando rodr \? ez carre \? 40 , who had produced a string of scoops as the longtime crime reporter for the newspaper el diario mr rodr \? ez was shot to death last nov 13 as he prepared to take his 8yearold daughter to school she was at his side and saw her father struck by at least 10 bullets it was similar to hundreds of homicides we 've had here , remarked mr garc \? mr ibarra s supervisor it was an execution it is also similar in that the perpetrators remain at large fear prevents many cases from being solved because investigators hesitate to dig too deeply , and witnesses refuse to talk nobody cooperates with anything , mr garc \? complained they 're too afraid nobody wants to say what they saw nobody wants to give you a plate number mexico is promoting confidential telephone lines and rewards to encourage witnesses , but resistance lingers , especially when news reports circulate about threats made to those who do call in and there is considerable doubt that the reward money is worth the risk the attacks on investigators only magnify the problem if you had a difficult case , you went to him and said , 'ibarra , what do you think \? ' mr garc \? said now in trying to solve mr ibarra s murder , his colleagues wonder aloud how he might have pursued his killers , possibly four men in all , who shot him many times in the head with 45caliber and 9millimeter weapons the slain journalist s wife , blanca mart \? z , said that she had met once with mr ibarra , but that she did not think he had been murdered for closing in on her husband s killers , despite his reputation for solving difficult crimes i do n't think he was really investigating , she said prosecutors had asked once to interview her young daughter , a witness , but had never followed up , ms mart \? z said pedro torres , mr rodr \? ez s editor and close friend , was similarly unimpressed with the government s effort to find the killers of his top police reporter

presidentelect barack obama , in fulfilling a campaign promise , plans to issue an executive order next wednesday directing the closing of the guant namo bay detention camp in cuba but he acknowledged in an interview on sunday on abc , that it is more difficult than i think a lot of people realize to balance an adherence to a rule of law without releasing people intent on blowing us up we asked these experts what the hardest challenge the new administration will face , and how that might be resolved , a senior fellow and research director in public law at the brookings institution , is the author of law and the long war the future of justice in the age of terror and a member of the hoover institution task force on national security and the law the hardest single question in closing guant namo is what to do with those detainees whom the government believes in good faith to be too dangerous to set free yet who could not plausibly face trial before any tribunal of which america could stand proud today s times reports that the obama transition appear s to have rejected a proposal to seek a new law authorizing indefinite detention inside the united states such a rejection would be a real shame the alternatives to creating a responsible new detention authority are all bad , and establishing reasonable authority to detain the enemy in a global struggle against terrorism would be neither radical nor inconsistent with america s constitutional traditions if obama has ruled out a new detention law , he has only three options for handling the group of hard core detainees he can the let them go and try to manage the risk they pose by means other than detention he can keep holding them under current detention authorities , rooted in the laws of war if he pursues this second course , then the closure of guant namo will be something a sham guant namo will have moved and shrunk , but the policy will not really have changed much the third possibility is to transfer lots more detainees to the custody of other countries , which might do anything from freeing them to torturing them none of these options should be attractive to the new president that s why a new detention law warrants a second look the war on terror is a hybrid conflict with attributes of both warfare and criminal justice but all of the hallmarks of neither like conventional warfare , there is the need to detain the enemy outside of the criminal justice system but global counterterrorism shares with criminal justice the issue of genuine doubt in many instances about who the bad guys really are hence the need for due process protections carefully designed to make sure that the people we lock up are actually the dangerous terrorists we believe them to be a carefully drawn administrative detention law could provide for both of these needs it could give the executive branch flexibility that the criminal justice system rightly denies it in locking up individuals who mean to do america great harm , and it could also give those accused a robust set of procedural rights designed to protect against erroneous detention unless mr obama is willing to take on significant new risk , not having such an administrative detention law would not mean ending extracriminal detention the united states and its partners will continue to act to neutralize terrorism threats without new legal tools , in all likelihood that means there will still be some combination of detentions abroad , under less protective lawofwar standards , detentions by proxy governments , and targeted killing these possible outcomes would present a dubious accomplishment for human rights is a professor at georgetown university law center , and the author , most recently , of justice at war the men and ideas that shaped america s war on terror , ' and the essay published in boston review closing guantanamo raises the contentious issue of what to do with the 250 people still being held there many in the human rights community advocate a simple solution try them in criminal courts or release them but that solution fails to recognize the united states legitimate interest in holding individuals fighting against it in armed conflict others have advocated a new preventive detention regime for suspected terrorists such a scheme would give the government more flexibility , to be sure , but at an unacceptable cost to fundamental rights those who can be tried for war crimes should be , not in makeshift military tribunals , but in regular courts martial or civilian criminal courts and those whom even the bush administration admits do not need to be detained should be released either to other countries or resettled in the united states but there are still others , as many as 100 detainees , who may not be prosecutable for a specific offense , but who are too dangerous to release eg , admitted al qaeda or taliban fighters who have said that they would return to the battle in afghanistan if released what should be done about them \? my view is that , consistent with international and constitutional law obligations , these individuals can continue to be held for the duration of the ongoing armed conflict with the taliban and al qaeda as prisoners of war , without criminal charge or criminal trial we need not try or release , so long as we hold only those fighting for the other side in an ongoing armed conflict and do so consistent with the laws of war , international human rights , and due process the problem with guantanamo was that the administration asserted that it did not have to follow any of the minimal rules that protect prisoners of war it did not have to give them hearings to ascertain whether they were indeed fighters for the enemy , and it was not limited to holding al qaeda and taliban fighters , but could hold anyone it deemed even distantly associated with those groups a law authorizing military detention only of those fighting for al qaeda or the taliban not suspected terrorists , not those who provide material support , not those associated with groups associated with al qaeda and only for the duration of the ongoing conflict in afghanistan , would pass international muster nothing in the laws of war prohibits such detentions indeed , the laws of war assume that persons fighting against the state will be detained , and simply seek to establish minimum levels of treatment for them we should detain individuals only if the government can establish by clear and convincing evidence in a fair hearing that they meet the narrow definition of enemy combatants detainees should be afforded counsel , and at bottom must be afforded a meaningful opportunity to contest their status but if the united states could hold italian and german soldiers during world war ii for the duration of the conflict , it should have the same authority to hold al qaeda and taliban fighters not for the neverending war on terror , but for the duration of the conflict with al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan , a former federal prosecutor and author of willful blindness memoir of the jihad , is legal affairs editor at national review it is impossible for someone who has demagogued a complex problem , as presidentelect obama has , to move from overheated rhetoric into responsible governing so , he has begun trying to control the inevitable damage reports about his imminent executive order represent stage two of that effort unfortunately , what mr obama is saying is meaningless where it is not wrongheaded the guant namo executive order should instead be called a symbolic order since it is not intended to execute anything guantanamo will continue operating just as it has mr obama s stated desire to close it at some future point is the same desire members of the bush administration have been stating for some time in fact , the promise to make diplomatic efforts to repatriate alleged combatants is the same effort bush has been pursuing for years which is why over 500 detainees \( twothirds of the detainees \) have already been transferred out of guantanamo mr obama falters in his premises first , his spokesperson says , the legal framework at guant namo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists but the purpose of holding enemy combatants in wartime \( which the supreme court has repeatedly validated , as recently as the 2004 hamdi case \) is not to prosecute them but to remove them from the battlefield and derive intelligence prosecution is incidental to that purpose , and often not practical if your first imperative in detaining people is the right one \( ie , to defeat the enemy and protect americans \) , you are going to detain many people who cannot be prosecuted at all , let alone swiftly mr obama has said that evidence proving detainee dangerousness , though possibly true , could be tainted that misstates the problem the intelligence at issue was not collected for prosecution purposes it may not be usable in court because it is too sensitive or its acquisition was not attended by routine lawenforcement protocols \( like miranda warnings \) that doesn t make it tainted it reflects the fundamental difference between investigating a criminal and fighting a combatant is a law professor at university of california , davis a particularly difficult challenge facing the obama administration is , put simply , politics there are many ways to close guant namo , to invoke the elastic catchphrase of the day at one extreme mr obama could end indefinite detention at the us naval base in cuba but reinstate it stateside or at some new offshore site at the other , he could order every us terrorism detainee , everywhere in the world , to be charged with a crime or released he is not likely to do either choosing a middle path will be difficult mr obama will have to acknowledge that even if it had no legal constraints , government could not act to ensure absolute security yet government can work toward that goal can manage the risk of terrorism even while acknowledging that it cannot fully eliminate that risk the first step in closing guant namo must be to talk to americans as adults about the nature of terrorism in a way that president bush never did then mr obama and his lawyers will need to take fresh looks at the case files to determine who poses no genuine , continuing threat even the bush administration says that many of the 250 detainees fall into this category those detainees should be released at once sent home or , if they risk harm at home , given asylum in some third country \( allowing a small number of these persons to settle in the united states would make it politically easier for our allies to accept others \) he next must make good on his promise to bring detainees deemed threats to stand trial in us courts there are many ways for prosecutors to secure convictions untainted by coerced evidence through imaginative use of existing criminal laws not unlike approaches going back to the days of al capone the capone solution may not close the matter there may indeed be a few individuals who are truly dangerous but whom the united states cannot convict , at least in part because it subjected them to torture in the course of captivity american laws require that such persons be released whether to obey or defy those laws whether to accept the consequences of a two hundred year old american legal tradition or to change it forever on account of a few individuals is a political decision that the new president , and congress , will have to face is associate professor at columbia law school , adjunct senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , and member of the hoover institution task force on national security and law he previously held senior positions at the us state department , defense department and national security council more important than whether presidentelect obama closes guantanamo is how his administration does so especially what legal process it provides those detainees it holds on to mr obama s recent statement that we need a detention system that adheres to rule of law but doesn t result in releasing people who are intent on blowing us up seems designed to keep options open he s smart to do so the big question is what to do with any detainees who are too dangerous to send home but who cannot be effectively prosecuted some expect this category to be very small , but i m not so sanguine even when the information linking some of the most dangerous suspects to al qaeda terrorism is reliable , it may not be usable or admissible in court if federal prosecutions aren t workable , and releasing the most dangerous detainees is ruled out , the new administration has few good options it could continue to hold them in us facilities as enemy combatants an alternative is seeking legislation authorizing administrative detention for periods of time of a narrow category of detainees , pursuant to strict standards and robust judicial review critics justifiably worry that such proposals institutionalize detentionwithouttrial and it appears the obama administration has rejected such a plan , at least in the short term but the thorny problems of detaining terrorism suspects picked up in lawless regions or amid covert intelligence operations will persist long after the 250 remaining guantanamo cases are resolved
seal harbor , me on a perfect august afternoon , some of the nation s wealthiest and most philanthropically generous citizens gathered on the porch of david rockefeller jr s home here , but neither the crowd nor the view of the sparkling atlantic ocean was the attraction instead they had come to grab \( they hoped \) a few minutes of chitchat with the documentary filmmaker , who for the occasion had reluctantly put on a blue blazer to go with his everpresent jeans in recent years mr burns , whose patented blend of original photographs , celebrity readings and articulate historians has captivated the television documentary audience with programs like the civil war , baseball and jazz , has suffered some setbacks his last project , with lynn novick , the 15hour 2007 world war ii history the war , received a couple of particularly dismissive reviews , and he has lost his guaranteed financing from the struggling general motors , forcing him to spend more time hustling for support none of that seems to matter to his fans , whose ardor has only increased \( the war drew pbs s largest audience in a decade \) and that celebrity is particularly crucial to a broad list of groups that need him more than ever pbs has high expectations for mr burns s new 12hour film , the national parks america s best idea , which begins sept 27 , and which prompted the august cocktail financially challenged public television stations want him to visit their towns as a draw for major donors the national park service is hoping that the new film will inspire more visitors and has prepared dozens of tiein events across the country and philanthropic groups like the national park foundation \( of which david rockefeller jr is vice chairman emeritus \) , the national parks conservation association and friends of acadia , a sponsor of the august event , are using him to raise the profile for their own causes ten years in the making , the new film , while not a travelogue , is an unabashed love letter , with its backdrop of spectacular vistas filmed in 53 national parks it had its beginning when dayton duncan , an author who was the national press secretary for michael dukakis s 1988 presidential campaign \( and is mr burns s best friend and frequent collaborator \) , was appointed to the national park foundation board and was pondering how to contribute mr duncan , who appears in the film and wrote a companion book with mr burns , frequently chokes up when discussing the project the film covers a wide scope , from the inspirational writings of the naturalist john muir in the 1800s up through 1980 it tells the multiple stories , mr duncan said , of an individual , a small group of people , an organization who fell in love with a place so deeply that they dedicated themselves to finally convince the government over a long struggle that it should be set aside for everyone the grand canyon , mr burns said , is the most obvious thing to be a national park , and yet it took decades to make it so , given the special interests that wanted it for other uses in each place , he added , there s great conflict and drama and unbelievable characters and great scenery but the film s broadcast is merely the most visible centerpiece of myriad related initiatives for the last year mr burns has , by his estimate , been away from his new hampshire home for 110 days , hopscotching the country as part of a 6 million promotional campaign in one august week mr burns , 55 , flew from a meeting with television critics in los angeles to a station event in cleveland , and then drove some 1 , 800 miles for several days of promotional activities , with 6 , 000 people coming out to hear him in chautauqua , ny 1 , 200 in bar harbor , me and 1 , 500 in portland in between he recorded promotional spots , posed for tourist pictures snapped by mr duncan and went to the top of cadillac mountain in acadia national park at 4 45 am to watch the country s first sunrise for cbs cameras of his travels , he acknowledged there s an evangelical dimension to it people ask me what i like i like shooting i like getting up at 3 am and getting out with the camera and getting out and filming i like that moment in the edit room where the removal of something or the addition of something or the rearranging of something makes it better and then i love the proselytizing that is a good deal of his appeal , said judith goldstein , a historian who appears in the film and whose private somes pond center was one of the sponsors of the rockefeller event when mr burns and mr duncan discussed the film in bar harbor , she said , people were almost more touched by their language , by the things they had to say about the film , than by the film itself she added , it s very rare that filmmakers are as articulate mr burns was cuttingedge once , and now he s traditional , ms goldstein said , but his fans , of which she is one , appreciate that these films are partly talking head but also a kind of wonderful deference to those who mattered in the past not all the critics agree the new yorker s nancy franklin , for one , called the war tedious alessandra stanley in the new york times faulted it for ignoring voices that happened not to be american but that did n't discourage viewers the program reached 378 million people in its first run , according to nielsen numbers provided by pbs mr burns admitted to the portland audience that he has made the same film over and over again , one with a single theme at its core who are we \? in an interview , he said , i think 90 percent of the reason that people like these films is that we treat them like they 're smart he said he has resigned himself to the negative reviews , which he attributed partly to his work s lack of irony irony is a protective armor that substitutes sometimes for the experience of real emotion , he said it s easy to dismiss huge swaths of a complicated american polity because they are unironic as powerful a pull as similar projects may be he is updating his baseball series , investigating prohibition and profiling the two president roosevelts next mr burns is working on one film that raised many eyebrows when he discussed it in maine a reexamination of the 1989 rape and beating of a central park jogger the five men originally convicted and imprisoned were released in 2002 after another man confessed mr burns , who has already found financing from atlantic philanthropies , said he became interested in the men s story after his daughter interned at a law firm handling a suit on their behalf the subject is hardly historic , but mr burns says he has found a way to make it so he sees parallels between the central park five , as he calls them , and the socalled scottsboro boys , charged in a 1931 rape case that eventually led to a supreme court ruling on the racial makeup of juries but first there is america s best idea to promote so on sept 26 , national public lands day , there will be screenings in national parks across the country and one on the ellipse in washington and on sept 23 there will be an evening preview in the east meadow of central park , accompanied by performances from carole king , eric benet , gavin degraw , jose feliciano , alison krauss and union station , and counting crows it will be beamed to pbs stations

inayat kalay , after a sixmonth campaign , the pakistani military is claiming victory over the in bajaur , a northern sliver of the tribal areas , saying the militants have suffered heavy losses and have been pushed over the border into afghanistan as evidence , the military this month showed off the oncebusy , milelong marketplace here , captured from the militants and pulverized to bits of concrete and mounds of dust a tank was still parked in the remains of a shop the resistance has been broken down we control the roads , said maj gen tariq khan , the inspector general of the , the paramilitary force responsible for security in the tribal regions they have lost already , pakistani officials are hailing bajaur as a landmark turn in the battle against islamic militants and are trying to persuade the 300 , 000 people displaced by the fighting here to return , aided by a 19 million program financed by the united states but beyond the bounds of a tightly guarded tour of bajaur for reporters , the larger battle against the taliban and al qaeda , whose fighters are deeply entrenched across northwestern pakistan , seems unsettled residents and western military experts , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the political situation , said it was likely that rather than being finally uprooted from this slice of bajaur and a nearby stronghold in loe sam , the bulk of the taliban forces had retreated to mountain enclaves , waiting to return , as they have so often , when the military eases off at the same time , a who have seized the swat valley , an area just east of here , has called into question the military s ability and the government s willingness to take on the militants with finality the heavy bombardment and troop concentration , cited by the military as its winning formula here , have alienated much of the population , according to interviews with residents and refugees from this area the joint pakistani and american plan to keep this area free of the taliban hinges on meeting the tough challenge of rapidly winning the support of these displaced people if the government does n't build and attract tribesmen back quickly , and do things to put money in their pockets , there is every likelihood of a reversion to the militants , said khalid aziz , a former chief secretary of the northwest frontier province , who is working on the pakistaniamerican effort for bajaur among other things , he said , the displaced need agricultural help the economy does n't exist now , he said under the joint program to bring refugees back here , essential services like electricity and water would be repaired , damaged homes rebuilt , and cashforwork programs started , the representative of the federal government in bajaur , shafirullah wazir , said the plan envisions creating a new civilian volunteer force , backed by the paramilitary frontier corps , to help keep order , an american official said but many obstacles must be overcome , including convincing disaffected tribal elders who have been singled out by the taliban and abandoned by the government that it is in their interest to return , the officials said one of them is idrees khan , a tribal elder from inayat kalay who with his four brothers owns most of the properties in the ruined marketplace he said he had been asked by the government to return now that the military campaign was over but now , he said , he has conditions a natural ally of the government , whose duty as a tribal leader is to act as a broker between the militants and the authorities , mr khan said he left inayat kalay two months ago when it was clear that the military was planning to attack he left with bad feelings and remains bitter , he said the family tried under tremendous odds to stave off the taliban in december , he said when the militants attacked one of their houses near the market and his brother called for help , the army showed up late and was of little help , he said a helicopter gunship came after the taliban had fled , but it shot at the family house anyway , severely damaging it , he said the government betrayed my brother , he said in an interview in peshawar , the capital of the northwest frontier province we want compensation for the structures that have been demolished , mr khan said , and we want accountability from the government and the taliban despite the government s assurances , many refugees said they were not convinced that it was safe to return in a camp for the displaced near peshawar , families from bajaur complained that they had received no offers of aid from the government others said they had little information several residents of inayat kalay said they were nervous about security because they had tried to raise a volunteer army against the taliban last fall , but had received inadequate backing from the authorities what s going on is very secretive , said nawab khan , a laborer from inayat kalay it s like being in the dark where you ca n't see he said he was reluctant to return , in part because he had no confidence in the pakistani government when we returned in november they shelled us , he said we do n't want to repeat that general khan , in a briefing of reporters invited by the army to bajaur , said that 1 , 600 militants had been killed in the sixmonth campaign but residents said they did not believe that claim , and western military officials said it was impossible to gauge how many taliban fighters had been killed because the army had not shown any bodies mr khan , the tribal leader , was outraged that the main compound of fakir mohammed , a senior taliban leader in bajaur , appeared to go completely unscathed fakir mohammed is sitting in damadola , mr khan said why do n't they hit his house \? general khan acknowledged that none of the taliban s top leaders had been killed he blamed weak intelligence in mohmand , the neighboring tribal area to the south of bajaur , the pakistani military is also claiming success against the taliban the frontier corps escorted reporters to qandharo , a village on flatlands where a boys' high school that served as a military headquarters of mohmand s taliban leader , abdul wali , was now controlled by the frontier corps an islamic court run by the taliban is no longer operating , officers of the corps said but the day before the reporters' visit , militants shot and killed three frontier corps members in mohmand , and three government security men were killed on patrol when their truck hit a land mine and on saturday , in a sign that the militants can still create havoc in mohmand , 14 paramilitary recruits , known as levies , were killed by the taliban in the yaka ghund area , the authorities said the levies , the most lightly armed of the paramilitary troops in the tribal area , were killed after trying to come to the rescue of a tribal elder whose house had been surrounded by the militants the taliban apparently singled out the elder because he had been visited by a senior government official a doctor from mohmand , who was interviewed in peshawar but spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his family s safety , said the militants had been weakened in mohmand and were no longer able to roam freely instead of traveling in large groups and convoys of many cars , they must now travel furtively , he said but he said the militants were regrouping in the mountains around the villages of mitai and chinarai in mitai , a considerable number of arab men , with their wives and children , recently arrived , he said even if the military victory in bajaur and mohmand holds , some pakistani and american officials cautioned that it might not mean much in the larger picture though strategically placed , they are relatively small pockets of the tribal belt , with relatively educated populations and benign terrain much tougher challenges would face the pakistani military , the officials said , if it decided to take on the harsh territory and entrenched taliban and qaeda forces in south and north waziristan
democratic officials have been busily trying to tamp down talk of a second stimulus package anytime soon , after their support for that possibility set off a flurry of headlines and generated new republican opposition representative john boehner , the minority leader in the house , released a statement calling plans for a second stimulus a plot for another spending spree others pounced on the notion as an admission that the first package which states are just beginning to grapple with would fail in response , democrats have been walking back the notion a little bit , seeking time to see how effective the 787 billion moving into the economy will be but even as lawmakers face what s been called spending fatigue with such huge price tags on items like the first stimulus , the bailout money from last fall and the 410 billion omnibus spending bill from last year that president obama signed yesterday , a second stimulus may well be considered later on and certainly has been on the minds of some economists and lawmakers as they assess the worsening economy representative david obey , chairman of the house appropriations committee , acknowledged this week that he had told his staff to start thinking about it , aides said talking with reporters yesterday , he said the first stimulus would take a while to have an impact but , he added , prudence would dictate that you would anticipate that you might need other things so it s a simple routine to begin to prepare possible options if you have a next requirement now most of the economists i talked to said it s spectacularly unreasonable to expect to see this stimulus package any time soon it takes a number of months to get out in the field and to get moving update speaker nancy pelosi took another stab at explaining her position at her weekly news conference this morning , when the first question directly aimed at whether there would be another stimulus bill she said i really would like to focus on the first one i know that people have made suggestions that we should be ready to do something , but i really would like to see this stimulus package play out i think it s important that the american people and the congress of the united states have confidence in the recovery package that we have passed we believe that it has the right components to take the country in a new direction in terms of job creation , tax cuts for the middle class , investments in the short term for job creation and longer term stabilization so i ve always been trying to be fiscally responsible about doing getting the most for i won t say a small amount of money because we re talking hundreds of billions of dollars as we go down that path as people make judgments , i would hope that we get the results that we need from this package but that doesn t mean that people won t talk about it , as one of our economists suggested the other day but not from my initiation much has been made of ms pelosi s comments on tuesday , after she met with economists and held a short news briefing asked if she supported such a measure , she said yes , i do a short while later , after discussing how effective the 787 billion package that has barely seeped out into the states would be in the coming months , she added you have to keep the door open to see how this goes but her embrace of the idea was coupled with caution about the need to monitor how the first package was working and the economists surrounding her retreated on estimates of job creation , saying the stimulus probably would generate a million fewer jobs than had been touted by the white house and the capitol building ms pelosi had been following up on comments made by mark zandi , the moody s economist , who said he was worried that the economic crisis was worse than he had anticipated and believed that more funds would be needed to turn it around with regard to taxpayer money , the point i m would like to make there is that we are going to need more taxpayer money up front i think another stimulus package is a reasonable probability , given the way things are going i think more money for financial stability , to shore up the banking system , is likely that s very likely i think more money for foreclosure mitigation may also be necessary at the end of the day again today , ms pelosi also acknowledged that house members may be talking about another stimulus , but said she preferred to concentrate on the budget and other bills making their way through committees then , she added of the possibility of further stimulus legislation but you don t close the door to some other things it s just not something that right now is in the cards none of this talk , of course , sat well with republicans , who opposed the first stimulus bill as too big and too expensive senator mitch mcconnell , the republican minority leader , said he believed repeated stimulus efforts would fail to revive the economy and drew parallels to japan s experience in the 1990s on cnn last night , representative eric cantor , the republican minority whip from virginia , said talk of a second stimulus was an admission of failure asserting that a republican plan would cost a lot less and still create more jobs , he added perhaps now if they re going back and putting another stimulus bill out there , that they will take some of our suggestions and focus the efforts on small business people around this country , that s how we re going to create the jobs still , a second stimulus seems in the far , not near , offing , and the fallout from talk about the need for another package seemed to distress some aides at the white house an economic adviser to vice president biden , jared bernstein , told msnbc i m not sure what cantor is saying , but the idea of attaching failure to the recovery act when it s literally getting into the system as we speak is just a really , really bad thing to do it s completely misleading and it doesn t represent reality in any way , shape or form remember , we ve got a plan that was signed literally a few weeks ago and this is a plan that is part of an economic package including financial stabilization , including getting the housing market back up and running again , all in the context of a budget that organizes spending over the course of the next ten years at the white house yesterday , robert gibbs , the press secretary , was also asked about the rumblings while saying he wasn t aware of discussions between the administration and lawmakers about another package , he added again , i think the onus is on all of government and all levels of government to institute effectively and in a transparent way the stimulus package that congress has approved that that s the onus that we have i think i said a few weeks ago we were trying to do too much now some think we re doing too little i think it speaks to the notion , as i ve said many times , that we have to there are a number of different things that have to be done in order to both stabilize our financial system and see our economy grow again stay tuned
how often does politico feel the need to scoop the contents of a newspaper column \? yesterday politico reported that george will was going to call for us ground troops to leave afghanistan , and in his washington post column today will does just that time to get out of afghanistan  will s column comes at crucial moment in the conflict , which candidate obama called a war of necessity \( as opposed to the war of choice in iraq \) once in office , president obama sent 17 , 000 more troops to the country , then sacked the us commander there tomorrow he gets the initial assessment of his new commander , lt gen stanley mcchrystal , who is expected to follow up with a request for more troops , anywhere from 10 , 000 to 45 , 000 meanwhile reports of corruption in the recent afghan election continue to surface public opinion polls show declining support for the engagement politico reports today that white house officials are increasingly worried liberal , antiwar democrats will demand a premature end to the afghanistan war to add a dash of confusion to the big picture , mcclatchy reports today that despite obama s apparent willingness to ramp up , the military brass are growing concerned regarding the administration s actual appetite for the war i think they \( the obama administration \) thought this would be more popular and easier , a senior pentagon official said we are not getting a bushlike commitment to this war in the midst of the all this , does will s dissent matter \? will opens by invoking the blood sacrifice of us soldiers america s finest in afghanistan and says that washington should keep faith with them by rapidly reversing the trajectory of america s involvement in afghanistan , where , says the dutch commander of coalition forces in a southern province , walking through the region is like walking through the old testament' will takes issue with the necessity for the country s recent election and the whole idea of nationbuilding even though violence exploded across iraq after , and partly because of , three elections , afghanistan s recent elections were called crucial to what \? they came , they went , they altered no fundamentals , all of which militate against american success , whatever that might mean creation of an effective central government \? afghanistan has never had one joint chiefs chief mike mullen speaks of combating afghanistan s culture of poverty but that took decades in just a few square miles of the south bronx gen stanley mcchrystal , the us commander in afghanistan , thinks jobs programs and local government services might entice many accidental guerrillas to leave the taliban but before launching new deal 20 in afghanistan , the obama administration should ask itself if us forces are there to prevent reestablishment of alqaeda bases evidently there are none now must there be nationbuilding invasions of somalia , yemen and other sovereignty vacuums \? will stops short of calling for a complete disengagement instead , he counsels that forces should be substantially reduced to serve a comprehensively revised policy america should do only what can be done from offshore , using intelligence , drones , cruise missiles , airstrikes and small , potent special forces units , concentrating on the porous 1 , 500mile border with pakistan , a nation that actually matters at new majority , jeb golinkin argues that as opposed to the doves on the left , which do not threaten the administration s afghanistan policy , the administration should be worried about losing george will to lose mr will s support will deeply trouble many administration officials not only because mr will remains one of , if not the most recognized newspaper columnist in america \( conservative or democrat \) but also because mr will s defection indicates that support on the right , particularly amongst realists like mr will \( and myself \) may not be as reliable as the administration may have originally believed anything resembling serious opposition to the war effort from moderate republicans and democrats alike would require a pr blitz that would quickly suck up much of the administration s remaining political capital the white house knows this , and you can expect them to mount a pr blitz in the coming days aimed at countering mr will s arguments , and in doing so holding together a portion of the right s suddenly fragile war support at salon , alex koppelman is not so sure that will s defection is a big moment it s an interesting piece , one bound to get some attention , but it s almost certainly not going to be a cronkite and vietnam moment , koppelman writes will doesn t hold the sway he used to , because there aren t many republicans like him left the blueblood east coast gop er economically conservative , socially moderate is all but extinct these days there isn t a single new england republican in the house of representatives anymore you re definitely not going to see , say , sarah palin quoting de gaulle on bismarck and the francoprussian war , as will did in this latest column \( and no , he didn t use first names or titles for either de gaulle or bismarck such things are for commoners \) so the other side of the right , the one that s come to dominate the republican party these days , isn t likely to respond favorably to will s suggestion , even if it does mean opposing a proposal of obama s judging by the response the dominate other side of the right which has been scathing toward will koppelman s take is more on point than golinkin s  my esteem for george will knows no bounds , writes rich lowry at national review but i don t find his column persuasive he s advocating a version of the murtha strategy for afghanistan counterterrorist strikes from a distance there are various problems with this one is that alqaeda is not in afghanistan , so who would be the targets \? are we going to wait for alqaeda to reestablish bases , and then hit them \? does that make any sense \? or are we going to target the taliban \? and if so , why would we pull out , which would very likely lead to the collapse of the afghan government and army and create the conditions for a taliban takeover \? at commentary , peter wehner says will has suffered a loss of nerve , and his column is one that could have been written in japanese aboard the uss missouri in 1983 the french journalist and intellectual jeanfrancois revel wrote how democracies perish it was a withering critique of the west s loss of nerve and will in the face of the totalitarian threat it faced in his book , revel wrote , democracy tends to ignore , even deny , threats to its existence because it loathes doing what is needed to counter them in a column praising revel s book , george will wrote , defense of democracy depends on pessimists who are not defeatists it depends on spirited realists such as jeanfrancois revel now , like then , america needs spirited realists , not defeatists we need individuals who believe a nation must be willing to fight for what is right even when it is hard we need people who are going to resist the temptation to eagerly support war at the outset and then prematurely give up on it what we need , in other words , is what george frederick will once was in the national review , frederick kagan dings will for criticizing the british effort in afghanistan , for deficiencies in his understanding of counterinsurgency theory and practice and for tone neither waving the bloody shirt nor rudely disparaging the efforts of allies who have shed their own blood alongside our troops is appropriate to this discussion but doing both in the same column is simply reprehensible at his own site , jules crittenden says will s column can be summed up quickly war s hard vietnam was hard , and also impossible , afghanistan s harder and more impossible abandon now cruise missile counterterrorism policy , please what is fascinating is how will writes as if sept 11 never happened , and the afghan war is happening in a vacuum in which the only strategic goal is providing security and economic development for the afghan people though in fairness will does , towards the end , mention the goal of denying al qaeda bases of operation , but only in despair , to suggest it s impossible , so why try \? it s also as if the 1970s and 80s , the postvietnam abandonment , never happened and , on the other hand , as if the turnaround in iraq never happened finally , in the washington post , william kristol says that will is not calling on the united states to accept a moderate degree of success in afghanistan , and simply to stop short of some overly ambitious goal will is urging retreat , and accepting defeat retreat and defeat ! it appears that the neocon rhetoric can be turned on those inside the tent as well as outside or maybe he s not so much inside anymore , at least on this issue david frum writes that what is being said by george will in public is already being muttered in private by congressional democrats , and therein lies trouble for the president barack obama has given afghanistan men and money but one vital resource is being withheld presidential time and commitment turning around an unsuccessful war demands intense presidential focus everyone around the president must be made to understand that the war is priority 1 , and that everything else on the agenda must be subordinated to this supreme imperative george w bush accepted that responsibility in 20062008 barack obama has not the results are as we see , in afghanistan and now in the darkening assessment of as strongspined an observer as george will

new haven when justice john paul stevens retires from the supreme court , probably at the conclusion of the new term that begins on monday , an era will end , but a window will open that is because justice stevens is the last remaining member of the court to have served with justice potter stewart , an eisenhower appointee who retired in 1981 when justice stewart gave his papers to yale , his alma mater , he stipulated that the files from his 23year supreme court tenure would become available only when none of his fellow justices remained on the bench whether justice stewart s papers are particularly illuminating remains to be seen even paul gewirtz , the potter stewart professor of constitutional law at yale law school , has no idea what is in them but many active players in supreme court affairs or at least active followers of the court during that consequential midcentury period are still around , and it is reasonable to suppose that more than a few will make their way to the sterling memorial library here to see for themselves unless life expectancy expands significantly during the next halfcentury , that will not be the case by the time the papers of the court s most recent retiree , david h souter , open to the public justice souter announced in late summer that he had given his papers to the new hampshire historical society in concord , where they will remain closed for 50 years given david souter s wellknown penchant for privacy \( he once that television cameras would enter the supreme court only by rolling over his dead body \) , his decision is perhaps not surprising but it is too bad he served on the court for 19 years , a period that included most of william h rehnquist s tenure as chief justice and the consolidation of conservative power under chief justice john g roberts jr no one who argued a case , brought a case or even read a case during those years unless it s one of today s law students , swinging by concord during an elderhostel trip to new england to see the changing leaves is likely to be examining justice souter s files in 2059 \( one exception might be savana redding , the middleschool student whom school officials stripsearched on a quest for concealed advil in june , justice souter wrote the court s declaring that the search , which turned up nothing , was unconstitutional ms redding will be 70 , the age that justice souter is now , when she can view the case file \) recognizing that my own chance of ever seeing justice souter s files is less than slim , i tried to persuade myself that i did n't really care \( i had already had my fun with supreme court files , writing a book in 2005 based on justice harry a blackmun s papers \) but then i thought of all the supreme court mysteries i would like to solve with the help of the memos and drafts that i assume this longtime diary keeper would have preserved in the interests of space , i will mention just one of these mysteries , from the court s last term it is the surprising outcome of the big voting rights act case , in which the court had undertaken to decide whether congress exceeded its authority in renewing the requirement for some states and jurisdictions , mostly in the south , to obtain federal approval before making any change to a voting procedure , however minor this preclearance provision , section 5 of the act , was the key to the law s effectiveness over three decades in expanding and preserving minority voting rights the by chief justice roberts , ducked the constitutional issue on the ground that the small texas sewer district that brought the case might be entitled to bail out of the law and so might have nothing to complain about this was an implausible outcome , to put it mildly , because the statute s text actually made the sewer district and other small jurisdictions like it ineligible to escape the law s provisions chief justice roberts has won praise in some quarters for a statesmanlike , minimalist solution to a hotbutton constitutional problem i have strong doubts as to whether the praise is deserved my belief is that he would have gone as far in the direction of declaring section 5 unconstitutional as he could have and still hold a majority the court surely did not accept this case for argument \( as opposed to simply affirming the law s constitutionality , as the bush administration had urged \) in order to decide whether the northwest austin municipal utility district no 1 was entitled to bail out i suspect that a member of the onceeager majority , perhaps justice anthony m kennedy , got cold feet , and that one or more of the liberal justices , maybe even justice souter , brokered a deal that allowed the court to extricate itself from a tight spot my evidence for this theory \? along with evidence for any other theory , it will be locked in a vault in concord , nh
los angeles the dodgers had two runners on base with no one out in the bottom of the eighth inning friday , so they ordered russell martin to bunt squaring around , he let four straight pitches from chan ho park zip past , fouled off another to send the count full and , with the sacrifice sign taken off , proceeded to swing away martin ripped a ground ball to third that resulted in the pivotal moment of the los angeles against the in game 2 of the national league championship series trying for a double play , second baseman chase utley misfired on his relay throw to first , allowing the tying run to score and extending what had been a bizarre inning for philadelphia asked whether it was dumb luck that martin did everything wrong but still accomplished his goal , phillies manager charlie manuel said he did not think so you know what i call that \? i call that baseball , manuel said , adding , sometimes , it comes our way sometimes , it goes the other team s way the dodgers may view utley s error and , by extension , their seriesevening victory friday as further evidence of their charmed postseason , that a world series is their destiny a misplayed liner by the st louis cardinals' matt holliday with two outs in the ninth inning turns into a dramatic comeback victory for the an inability to bunt turns into a botched double play that ties the score things must be going the dodgers' way for a reason , and there must be some cosmic meaning behind their stretch of good luck you hope , and you do n't try to think about it too much , said the dodgers' jim thome , who was 0 for 7 against scott eyre before lining an eighthinning single against him you take momentum and you try to carry it out as long as you can maybe there is something special here but for a veteran baseball man like manuel , it is one of those weird innings that defy statistical analysis or rational explanation in an era in which more and more metrics are used and numbers are dissected , the initial response , after a game like friday s , is to search for larger significance what does it mean when the defending world series champions have a ball go off a glove , overplay a bunt , foul up a double play , force in the winning run on a basesloaded walk \? that they are doomed , their quest for a repeat squashed \? hardly in the eighth inning , what befell the phillies , who had the secondhighest fielding percentage and made the secondfewest errors in the nl during the regular season , was a confluence of negative things that arrived without warning pedro feliz was shaded toward the thirdbase line , so he was a step slow to casey blake s leadoff single that caromed off his mitt ronnie belliard did not try to bunt the ball as hard as he did , but he pushed it past park for a single utley committed 12 errors this season , but by some measures , including the sabermetric ultimate zone rating , he was one of the best defensive second basemen in baseball when utley made an errant throw on a similar play in game 1 , his rhythm was disrupted by the flow of the play and he lost his grip on the ball he just flung the ball away in game 2 i do n't think he s made a throw like that all year long that s been that far off the mark , said the phillies' thirdbase coach , sam perlozzo , who works with the infielders i thought he s been pretty darn good , to be honest with you especially in the postseason , baseball s appeal is grounded in happenstance and unpredictability mariano rivera is the greatest closer ever , but he committed a throwing error in that spurred the yankees' downfall the los angeles angels are as fundamentally sound a team as there is , but they committed three errors and allowed a popup to drop between infielders on friday against the yankees even in game 1 at dodger stadium , george sherrill , who had not given up a home run to a lefthanded hitter all season , surrendered one to raul ibanez , and park , who had not pitched in a month , entered in the seventh inning with the tying run on second and subdued the teeth of the dodgers' lineup all of the momentum the phillies supposedly carried over from a fourhour game 1 into an early start did not matter much friday but they , unlike the cardinals , have a greater margin for error heading back home st louis never recovered from holliday s error , falling behind by two games to none in the bestoffive series and looking flat in succumbing in game 3 the phillies are a resilient bunch , coming from behind twice against colorado in the division series , and , having earned the split they wanted in los angeles , they return to philadelphia for game 3 on sunday with their ace , cliff lee , on the mound it s not like we went up there and they just pummeled us , phillies shortstop jimmy rollins said it s a game that got away from us , and we like the way we 're playing

kandahar , one morning two months ago , shamsia husseini and her sister were walking through the muddy streets to the local girls school when a man pulled alongside them on a motorcycle and posed what seemed like an ordinary question are you going to school \? then the man pulled shamsia s burqa from her head and sprayed her face with burning acid scars , jagged and discolored , now spread across shamsia s eyelids and most of her left cheek these days , her vision goes blurry , making it hard for her to read but if the acid attack against shamsia and 14 others students and teachers was meant to terrorize the girls into staying home , it appears to have completely failed today , nearly all of the wounded girls are back at the mirwais school for girls , including even shamsia , whose face was so badly burned that she had to be sent abroad for treatment perhaps even more remarkable , nearly every other female student in this deeply conservative community has returned as well about 1 , 300 in all my parents told me to keep coming to school even if i am killed , said shamsia , 17 , in a moment after class shamsia s mother , like nearly all of the adult women in the area , is unable to read or write the people who did this to me do n't want women to be educated they want us to be stupid things in the five years since the mirwais school for girls was built here by the japanese government , it appears to have set off something of a social revolution even as the tighten their noose around kandahar , the girls flock to the school each morning many of them walk more than two miles from their mudbrick houses up in the hills the girls burst through the school s walled compound , many of them flinging off headtotoe garments , bounding , cheering and laughing in ways that are inconceivable outside for girls and women of any age mirwais has no regular electricity , no running water , no paved streets women are rarely seen , and only then while clad in burqas that make their bodies shapeless and their faces invisible and so it was especially chilling on nov 12 , when three pairs of men on motorcycles began circling the school one of the teams used a spray bottle , another a squirt gun , another a jar they hit 11 girls and 4 teachers in all 6 went to the hospital shamsia fared the worst the attacks appeared to be the work of the taliban , the fundamentalist movement that is battling the government and the americanled coalition banning girls from school was one of the most notorious symbols of the taliban s rule before they were ousted from power in november 2001 building new schools and ensuring that children and especially girls attend has been one of the main objectives of the government and the nations that have contributed to afghanistan s reconstruction some of the students at the mirwais school are in their late teens and early 20s , attending school for the first time yet at the same time , in the guerrilla war that has unfolded across southern and eastern afghanistan , the taliban have made schools one of their special targets but exactly who was behind the acid attack is a mystery the taliban denied any part in it the police arrested eight men and , shortly after that , the ministry of interior released a video showing two men confessing one of them said he had been paid by an officer with the directorate for interservices intelligence , the pakistani intelligence agency , to carry out the attack but at a news conference last week , hamid karzai , the afghan president , said there was no such pakistani involvement one thing is certain in the months before the attack , the taliban had moved into the mirwais area and the rest of kandahar s outskirts as they did , posters began appearing in local mosques do n't let your daughters go to school , one of them said in the days after the attack , the mirwais school for girls stood empty none of the parents would let their daughters venture outside that is when the headmaster , mahmood qadari , got to work after four days of staring at empty classrooms , mr qadari called a meeting of the parents hundreds came to the school fathers and mothers and mr qadari implored them to let their daughters return after two weeks , a few returned so , mr qadari , whose three daughters live abroad , including one in virginia , enlisted the support of the local government the governor promised more police officers , a footbridge across a busy nearby road and , most important , a bus mr qadari called another meeting and told the parents that there was no longer any reason to hold their daughters back i told them , if you do n't send your daughters to school , then the enemy wins , mr qadari said i told them not to give in to darkness education is the way to improve our society the adults of mirwais did not need much persuading neither the bus nor the police nor the bridge has materialized , but the girls started showing up anyway only a couple of dozen girls regularly miss school now three of them are girls who had been injured in the attack i do n't want the girls sitting around and wasting their lives , said ghulam sekhi , an uncle of shamsia and her sister , atifa , age 14 , who was also burned for all the uncertainty outside its walls , the mirwais school brims with life its 40 classrooms are so full that classes are held in four tents , donated by unicef , in the courtyard the afghan ministry of education is building a permanent building as well the past several days at the school have been given over to examinations in one classroom , a geography class ,

like me , you re probably still licking your proverbial wagering wounds from the kentucky derby thanks to jockey calvin borel and the 501 longshot mine that bird but for those looking for salvation , have no fear , the preakness is here chances are you won t be able make a killing like you could have in the derby even though the preakness is shaping up to a be a full field , favorites have won the middle jewel of the triple crown an astonishing 69 times in 133 years \( a 52 percent clip \) to put that in perspective , a good rule of thumb is favorites win around onethird of the time as you are starting to zoom in on who you like for the battle in baltimore , i ve got some interesting stats for you to consider the longest price winner in the preakness was master derby at 231 in 1975 the derby meanwhile has seen four larger upsets in just the past 14 years thunder gulch , 1995 , 241 charismatic , 1999 , 301 giacomo , 2005 , 501 and mine that bird , 2009 , 501 the only two real upsets in the past 30 years came with excuses for the derby winners the tragic 2006 renewal when barbaro pulled up shortly after the start , leaving bernardini to coast home at odds of 121 and the 1983 edition , which saw deputed testamony take advantage of a sloppy surface on his home track , leaving the derby winner sunny s halo to finish a nonthreatening sixth so what s in store for next saturday \? if the super filly rachel alexandra s new owners elect to run her in the preakness , she will likely be the favorite and deservedly so her kentucky oaks win was breathtaking and none of the colts in this sophomore class have been all that impressive and for those who are wondering yes , fillies have won the preakness four in fact , but 54 have tried \( that s just 7 percent \) that s a lot of history to overcome , and rachel alexandra would be the first since nellie morse in 1924 but what of the derby winner \? most derby winners are the posttime favorite but , as we can assume this year , winning the run for the roses doesn t guarantee you preakness favoritism looking at the derby winners with the longest odds at preakness post time , we find that charismatic won at odds of 8401 \( 1999 \) , gallahadion ran third at 6701 \( 1940 \) , broker s tip finished 10th and last at 6501 \( 1933 \) , and giacomo closed for third at 61 \( 2005 \) mine that bird , who could have a new jockey aboard , will likely not be the favorite with or without rachel alexandra if borel doesn t ride mine that bird , it would be the first time a derbywinning jockey didn t ride the horse in the preakness since eddie arcaro and hoop jr in 1945 \( and the two other previously guilty parties in this case are brokers tip in 1933 , and bold venture in 1936 in 1927 , whiskery was ridden by different jockeys in the preakness and the derby , but the preakness was run first that year \) as of today , with a potential field that includes rachel , pioneerof the nile and the derby favorite friesan fire , mine that bird lovers could very well be rewarded handsomely again how high of a price might you get \? if i had to put money on it right now , and if there is a fast track , i d say that mine that bird will be just as overlooked at the betting windows as charismatic was but be careful the latter was nearly a triple crown winner if the track is sloppy , then the bird will be one of the favorites either way , study hard because there will be ways to make some money i know i will after the bird picked my pocket in the derby lane gold , the former director of derby spin at churchill downs , is now based out of new york but he can still be heard talking horses to anyone who ll listen whether on louisville radio or to his favorite mutuel clerk
leonard nimoy is an author whose poetry collections include a lifetime of love poems on the passages of life , a photographer whose monographs include shekhina and the director of seven films including three men and a baby he has also appeared on such television shows as mission impossible and in search of oh , what the heck leonard nimoy is spock played him in three seasons of the original star trek television series as well as six feature films , including star trek iii the search for spock and star trek iv the voyage home , both of which he directed he can also be seen reprising his role as spock or is that spock prime \? in the newly released star trek film directed by j j abrams  we spoke with mr nimoy earlier this morning about star trek , his famous role and an early encounter he had with the president a few days ago i learned i d been so how is your last name correctly pronounced \? i say neemoy but that s interesting what you re saying about gahdoh i ve always said godoh the last year , my wife and i went to see a wonderful production done by the abbey theater players , they did it in los angeles and they referred to it as gahdoh so i thought , well , i guess we re wrong but i say neemoy when was the last time someone approached you by saying they really enjoyed your performance in invasion of the body snatchers \? oh , thank you i like that a lot i thought that was a very good movie i know that the title of your book i am not spock has been misconstrued , but was the burden of having been spock ever too much for you \? the only time it was a concern was when we had finished making the original series , and star trek became enormously popular in reruns in the 1970s around 71 , 72 , suddenly this whole thing erupted into a phenomenon there was this tremendous hunger for star trek , but there were none produced for 11 years during that time , whenever i went about my business acting in other projects , the questions were always about star trek tell us about star trek why don t you do more star trek \? it was a problem then and i did write a book called i am not spock , which was a mistake i was trying to illuminate the actor s process in creating a character i talked about the fact that i grew up in boston and spock did not my parents were russian immigrants spock s were not i m an actor who portrays this character but i did say in that book that if i were given the choice of any character ever portrayed on television , i would choose spock not enough people made it to that page of the book a lot of people didn t get past the title do fans still expect you to be as conversant in star trek lore and mythology as they are \? i had an embarrassing experience once , many years ago i was invited to go to caltech and was introduced to a number of very brilliant young people who were working on interesting projects they walked me through , and they would we re doing this and we re doing that , and we re trying to figure out why this is happening and then they d say to me , what do you think \? expecting me to have some very sound advice and i would nod very quietly and very sagely i would say , you re on the right track i ve heard that you were approached over the years to portray spock in other trek projects and declined how were you persuaded to appear in the new film \? when they made the first generations film , there was one scene where all the original cast was included , including spock but the spock dialogue was not spock character dialogue it was expositional dialogue that had nothing to do with the spock character and i said to the producer at the time there s no real spock character in this film you can distribute those lines amongst anyone else in the scene and it wouldn t make any difference i did not appear in that film that s the film in which they killed captain kirk , i thought rather gratuitously there was no reason for doing that i had not been asked to play spock ever since then , until j j abrams contacted me for this movie i had a wonderful meeting with j j and bob orci and alex kurtzman , the writers they spoke intelligently and very passionately about what star trek was for them and it really put me back in touch with what i felt was the best of what star trek and spock were when we were making the original shows they wrote a very exciting script i think it s obvious that it s a very big movie , but it s also a very touching and very personal movie there s a great heart at the center of it if you were approached with the same passion and interest , could you be convinced to record another album \? oh , i doubt that that s too bad i have a colleague here who really swears by i had a great time doing it i never looked for a recording career what happened was , we were making the original series and somebody from the studio came to me one day and said , there s a gentleman in new york who s producing an album of music from star trek your picture as spock is going to be on the cover would you like to be involved in the making of the album i thought i should be they had already recorded six of the 12 tracks , and in a very short period of time we recorded the other six tracks may i nerd out on you for one moment \? your character in the new star trek is called spock prime is that in the celestial sense , meaning the largest or most important \? or in the mathematical sense , meaning a derivative or a piece of something larger \? i think it s in the celestial sense laughs i kind of like it it gives a dignified presentation of the character it could also be in the usda sense that s right this is the good stuff president obama has drawn notinfrequent comparisons to the spock character do you see any similarities there \? i ve met him twice the first time was a couple years ago , very early on when he had just announced his candidacy he was in los angeles , speaking at a luncheon we were invited to there was a very small crowd minuscule compared to the crowd that he gathered later at a private home in los angeles and we were standing on the back patio , waiting for him and he came through the house , saw me and immediately put his hand up in the vulcan gesture he said , they told me you were here we had a wonderful brief conversation and i said , it would be logical if you would become president as a member of the tribe , can i ask if being jewish influenced your portrayal of spock \? i don t know if i can honestly say that maybe unconsciously , some of that seeped into the character certainly it did with the vulcan gesture it s derived from a blessing i learned about in synagogue when i was about eight or nine years old it has hebraic origins but the stoicism and reserve of the character , that wasn t a jewish thing \? no , i don t think so because on the other hand , you ve got bill shatner who s also jewish but is not exactly stoic
jakarta , indonesia every year during , the poor from every corner of the island of java gravitate here to the capital to beg they wander in between cars stuck at traffic corners , in the shadows of the city s skyscrapers and gigantic shopping malls , in the knowledge that islam s most sacred month makes people particularly charitable this year , however , jakarta is cracking down on the seasonal influx of beggars many of them belong to organized gangs and simply exploit religious sentiments , the authorities say and they add that the beggars pose a threat to the stability of jakarta , indonesia s most important city and the seat of power , a bubble of fivestar hotels and luxury stores that , in the words of one law enforcement official , feeds the outsiders' sweet dreams thirteen days into ramadan , jakarta had rounded up 1 , 465 beggars , most of them women and children , almost all from outside jakarta for the first time , the authorities are also going after those caught giving to beggars , though they have fined only 12 people so far a capital is built on the condition that it be a comfortable , safe and dignified place , said budiharjo , who took over jakarta s social welfare agency eight months ago and decided to penalize charity givers for the first time if we stop giving , naturally they will disappear , said mr budiharjo , who , like many indonesians , uses only one name he said investigators found that about 500 of the arrested beggars belonged to groups that gathered indonesians in villages and bused them to jakarta to beg during ramadan officials have arrested coordinators of the ring in jakarta , but were still looking for leaders outside the city , he said the authorities were enforcing a 2007 city bylaw that made it illegal not only to beg on city streets , but also to give to street beggars violators on both sides can be fined up to 2 , 000 and jailed for up to two months the 12 people caught giving were fined between 15 and 30 , mr budiharjo said all were apprehended while handing out money to beggars from inside their cars , an act as common as the city s traffic jams but the severity of the crackdown , in a developing country with not much of a social safety net , has drawn criticism from some of the local media , as well as those caught in the daily raids against beggars begging should be allowed , said jariyah , 39 , who had traveled a couple of hours by bus to beg with her 16monthold son we can ask for assistance from our relatives , but only once or twice otherwise , i 'd lose my dignity that s why i came here ms jariyah , who was being held in a screening center after being arrested , said she had come to jakarta on her own she had started begging , she said , because a daughter was entering junior high school and her husband , a , earned only a couple of dollars a day if he was lucky enough to find work the city was trying to steer both the needy and their donors to organized charities , though the number of poor vastly overwhelmed the few national charities one of this country s largest charities , rumah zakat , raised 71 million last year from individual and corporate donations , mostly in jakarta about 40 percent of the gifts came during ramadan and during the festival of id aladha , another important holiday , said rachmat ari kusamanto , the organization s chief executive rumah zakat finances educational and health programs , and lends money to help people start businesses the concept of charity is to empower people , not to make them dependent , mr rachmat said by giving money directly to a person , we are not empowering that person and yet things did not seem so clearcut at the screening center where some of the beggars were being held along with others picked off jakarta s streets a bus arrived regularly , dropping off people who were then placed in one of 15 categories at the center beggars , of course , but also unlicensed hawkers and musicians , the mentally ill , prostitutes , transvestites and other fixtures of jakarta s streetscape according to a large board , 120 beggars were among the 500 people being held at the center seventyfive were women , and children made up many of the 45 males they would stay at the center for up to 21 days , though most were held only a few days before being released or transferred to a rehabilitation center most milled around a large , open courtyard where laundry hung on clotheslines and neighborhood women were selling fried plantains but most of those caught for begging were inside a large room with carpets on which mothers and children usually lay none of the people randomly interviewed said they belonged to begging organizations the women , many of them nursing infants , said they just needed extra money i did n't know that begging was illegal , said sumilah , 33 , who said her husband had deserted her and their three children people like us have n't gone to school suciardi , the social welfare official in charge of the center , walked around , joking with some of those being detained a young girl , brought to the center for being a street musician , followed him around in his office , mr suciardi said that allowing beggars to operate freely would lead to increased criminality and , eventually , political instability if we allow them here , he said , jakarta will become the center for indonesia s poor a deaf and mute teenage boy who had made the center his home after being picked up in a gutter a decade ago came inside the office , clearly happy to see mr suciardi smiling , he patted mr suciardi s shirt pockets eventually , mr suciardi reached for his wallet inside his pants pocket and handed the boy a 20 , 000 rupiah bill , or 2 we do n't want to be mean to these people , mr suciardi said but national security and safety are at stake
if you wanted to pick the moment when the american news business went on suicide watch , it was almost exactly three years ago that s when stephen colbert , appearing at the annual white house correspondents' association dinner , accusing his hosts of being stenographers who had , in essence , let the bush white house get away with murder \( or at least the war in iraq \) to prove the point , the partying journalists in the washington hilton ballroom could be seen \( \) fawning over government potentates in some cases the very sources who had fed all those fictional sightings of saddam hussein s wmd colbert s routine did not kill the washington post that it fell flat the times initially but to the beltway s bafflement , colbert s riff , ultimately to have a marathon run as the most

has accelerated ever since newspaper circulations and revenues are in free fall legendary brands from to are teetering the new york times company if its employees did n't make substantial sacrifices

twitter than that more than 60 percent of twitter users abandon it after a single month the causes of journalism s downfall some selfinflicted , some beyond anyone s control \( a worldwide economic meltdown \) are well known to timetravel back to the dawn of the technological strand of the disaster , search youtube for what you 'll find is a 28yearold local television news piece from san francisco about a farfetched , preweb experiment by the city s two papers , the chronicle and the examiner , to distribute their wares to readers with home computers via primitive phone modems though there were at most 3 , 000 people in the bay area with pcs then , some 500 mailed in coupons for the service to the chronicle alone but , as the anchorwoman assures us at the end , with a twohour download time \( at 5 an hour \) , the new telepaper wo n't be much competition for the 20cent street edition the rest is irreversible history this farfetched newspaper experiment soon faded , even in san francisco , the gateway to silicon valley today the examiner , once the , exists in name only , as a the chronicle is under  but this selfdestructive retreat from innovation is hardly novel in the history of american communications in the last transformative tech revolution before the internet television s emergence in the late 1940s the pattern was remarkably similar the entertainment industry referred to tv as the monster , and by 1951 , the editor of the industry s trade paper , variety , was fearful that the monster would eventually swallow up practically all of show business movies had killed vaudeville a generation earlier this new household appliance threatened to strangle radio , movies , the broadway theater , nightclubs and the circus and newspapers too nbc s new today' attacked by papers as competition screamed a frontpage variety headline in 1952 the vulnerable establishments in all these fields went nuts most movie studios pushed back against the future by refusing to sell their old movies to television or allow their stars to appear on it few seized the opportunity to produce programs for the new medium instead , some moguls tried to compete by exhibiting sports events by closedcircuit in networks of movie houses in 195253 , cinerama , 3d and cinemascope were all heavily promoted to try to retain movie audiences none of these desperate rearguard actions could slow the video revolution movie newsreels , movie palaces , radio comedy and drama , and afternoon newspapers , among other staples of the american cultural diet , were all doomed and yet in 2009 , hollywood movie studios , radio and the broadway theater , though smaller and much changed , are not dead they learned to adapt and to collaborate with the monster in the internet era , many sectors of american media have been reenacting their at first complacent and finally panicked behavior of 60 years ago few in the entertainment business saw the digital cancer spreading through their old business models until well after filesharing , via napster , had started decimating the music industry it s not only journalism that is now struggling to plot a path to survival but , with all due respect to show business , it s only journalism that s essential to a functioning democracy and it s not just because as we keep being tediously reminded thomas jefferson said so yes , journalists have made tons of mistakes and always will but without their enterprise , to take a few representative recent examples , we would not have known about the wretched conditions for our , the government s , the or  such news gathering is not to be confused with opinion writing or bloviating including that practiced here opinions can be stimulating and , for the audiences at fox news and msnbc , cathartic we can spend hours surfing the posts of bloggers we like or despise , some of them gems , even as we might be moved to write our own blogs about local restaurants or the government documents we obsessively study online but opinions , however insightful or provocative and whether expressed online or in print or in prime time , are cheap reporting the news can be expensive some of it monitoring the local school board , say can and is being done by voluntary citizen journalists with time on their hands , integrity and a web site but we ca n't have serious opinions about america s role in combating the taliban in pakistan unless brave and knowledgeable correspondents \( with security to protect them \) tell us in real time what is actually going on there we ca n't know what is happening behind closed doors at corrupt , hardtopenetrate institutions in washington or wall street unless teams of reporters armed with the appropriate technical expertise and assiduously developed contacts are digging night and day those reporters have to eat and pay rent , whether they work for print , a tv network , a web operation or some new bottomup news organism we ca n't yet imagine it s immaterial whether we find the fruits of their labors on paper , a laptop screen , a blackberry , a kindle or podcast but someone and certainly not the government , with all its conflicted interests must pay for this content and make every effort to police its fairness and accuracy if we lose the last major newsgathering operations still standing , there will be no news on google news unless google shells out to replace them it wo n't one of the freshest commentators on internet culture , clay shirky , , correctly , that nobody really knows what form journalism will take in the evolving postnewspaper era looking back to the unpredictable social and cultural upheavals brought about by gutenberg s invention of movable type , he writes , we 're collectively living through 1500 , when it s easier to see what s broken than what will replace it so who will do the heavy journalistic lifting \? whatever works every experiment must be tried , professional and amateur , whether by institutions like the times or some 19yearold kid few of us have heard of what ca n't be reinvented is the wheel of commerce just because information wants to be free on the internet does n't mean it can always be free web advertising will never be profitable enough to support ambitious news gathering if a public that thinks nothing of spending money on texting or pornography does n't foot the bill for such reportage , it wo n't happen that s why the debate among journalists about possible forms of payment \( subscriptions , nprstyle donations , itunesstyle micropayments , foundation grants \) is inside baseball so is the acrimonious sniping between old media and new the real question is for the public , not journalists does it want to pony up for news , whatever the media that prevail \? it s all a matter of priorities not long ago , we laughed at the idea of pay tv free television was considered an inalienable american right \( as long as it was paid for by advertisers \) then cable and satellite became the national standard by all means let s mock the old mainstream media as they preen and party on in a washington ballroom let s deplore the tabloid journalism that , like the cockroach , will always be with us but if a comprehensive array of real news is to be part of the picture as well , the time will soon arrive for us to put up or shut up whatever shape journalism ultimately takes in america , make no mistake that in the end we will get what we pay for
baghdad despite major bombings that have rattled the nation , and fears of rising violence as american troops withdraw , s security forces have been relying on a device to detect bombs and weapons that the united states military and technical experts say is useless the small handheld wand , with a telescopic antenna on a swivel , is being used at hundreds of checkpoints in iraq but the device works on the same principle as a ouija board the power of suggestion said a retired united states air force officer , lt col hal bidlack , who described the wand as nothing more than an explosives divining rod still , the iraqi government has purchased more than 1 , 500 of the devices , known as the ade 651 , at costs from 16 , 500 to 60 , 000 each nearly every police checkpoint , and many iraqi military checkpoints , have one of the devices , which are now normally used in place of physical inspections of vehicles with violence dropping in the past two years , prime minister nuri kamal almaliki has taken down blast walls along dozens of streets , and he contends that iraqis will safeguard the nation as american troops leave but the recent bombings of government buildings here have underscored how precarious iraq remains , especially with the coming parliamentary elections and the violence expected to accompany them the suicide bombers who managed to get two tons of explosives into downtown baghdad , had to pass at least one checkpoint where the ade 651 is typically deployed , judging from surveillance videos released by baghdad s provincial governor the american military does not use the devices i do n't believe there s a magic wand that can detect explosives , said maj gen richard j rowe jr , who oversees iraqi police training for the american military if there was , we would all be using it i have no confidence that these work the iraqis , however , believe passionately in them whether it s magic or scientific , what i care about is it detects bombs , said maj gen jehad aljabiri , head of the ministry of the interior s general directorate for combating explosives dale murray , head of the , which does testing for the department of defense , said the center had tested several devices in this category , and none have ever performed better than random chance the justice department has warned against buying a variety of products that claim to detect explosives at a distance with a portable device normal remote explosives detection machinery , often employed in airports , weighs tons and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars the ade 651 s clients are mostly in developing countries no major country s military or police force is a customer , according to the manufacturer i do n't care about sandia or the department of justice or any of them , general jabiri said i know more about this issue than the americans do in fact , i know more about bombs than anyone in the world he attributed the decrease in bombings in baghdad since 2007 to the use of the wands at checkpoints american military officials credit the surge in american forces , as well as the , in which iraqi insurgents turned against al qaeda in mesopotamia , for the decrease aqeel alturaihi , the inspector general for the ministry of the interior , reported that the ministry bought 800 of the devices from a company called atsc \( uk \) ltd for 32 million in 2008 , and an unspecified larger quantity for 53 million mr turaihi said iraqi officials paid up to 60 , 000 apiece , when the wands could be purchased for as little as 18 , 500 he said he had begun an investigation into the nobid contracts with atsc jim mccormick , the head of atsc , based in london , did not return calls for comment the baghdad operations command announced tuesday that it had purchased an additional 100 detection devices , but general rowe said five to eight bombsniffing dogs could be purchased for 60 , 000 , with provable results checking cars with dogs , however , is a slow process , whereas the wands take only a few seconds per vehicle can you imagine dogs at all 400 checkpoints in baghdad \? general jabiri said the city would be a zoo speed is not the only issue colonel bidlack said , when they say they are selling you something that will save your son or daughter on a patrol , they 've crossed an insupportable line into moral depravity last year , , an organization seeking to debunk claims of the paranormal , publicly offered atsc 1 million if it could pass a scientific test proving that the device could detect explosives mr randi said no one from the company had taken up the offer atsc s promotional material claims that its device can find guns , ammunition , drugs , truffles , human bodies and even contraband ivory at distances up to a kilometer , underground , through walls , underwater or even from airplanes three miles high the device works on electrostatic magnetic ion attraction , atsc says to detect materials , the operator puts an array of plasticcoated cardboard cards with bar codes into a holder connected to the wand by a cable it would be laughable , colonel bidlack said , except someone down the street from you is counting on this to keep bombs off the streets proponents of the wand often argue that errors stem from the human operator , who they say must be rested , with a steady pulse and body temperature , before using the device then the operator must walk in place a few moments to charge the device , since it has no battery or other power source , and walk with the wand at right angles to the body if there are explosives or drugs to the operator s left , the wand is supposed to swivel to the operator s left and point at them if , as often happens , no explosives or weapons are found , the police may blame a false positive on other things found in the car , like perfume , air fresheners or gold fillings in the driver s teeth on tuesday , a guard and a driver for the new york times , both licensed to carry firearms , drove through nine police checkpoints that were using the device none of the checkpoint guards detected the two ak47 rifles and ammunition inside the vehicle during an interview on tuesday , general jabiri challenged a times reporter to test the ade 651 , placing a grenade and a machine pistol in plain view in his office despite two attempts , the wand did not detect the weapons when used by the reporter but did so each time it was used by a policeman you need more training , the general said
san francisco \( ap \) the operator of a lightrail train that crashed here , injuring dozens of passengers as well as the operator , came under scrutiny on sunday as federal investigators tried to figure out why he turned off the automatic controls moments before the accident ted turpin , an investigator with the national transportation safety board , said that the operator switched the controls from automatic to manual in a tunnel near the west portal station and that he never engaged the emergency brake had the operator kept the autopilot on , mr turpin said , the train would have slowed down before arriving at the station and most likely not have careened into a parked train while going 23 miles per hour he said the operator never engaged the emergency brake the crash injured 48 people , 4 seriously , but none of the injuries were lifethreatening , officials said two safety board investigators based in los angeles were working with transit officials to interview passengers and witnesses , and assessing the condition of the train tracks and signal systems and the structural integrity of the train cars involved investigators were also still checking whether the signaling system played a role in addition , investigators will be looking at whether cellphone use was a factor in the crash , as is standard in all train accident inquiries , mr turpin said neither mr turpin nor local transit officials would identify the operator , who was hospitalized after the crash and who was administered a drug test , which is standard procedure for crashes the crash is the fourth major subway or commuter rail accident in the united states in the past 10 months in september , a commuter rail train crashed with a freight rail in los angeles , killing 25 people the crash was attributed to a commuter rail engineer s sending on a cellphone about 50 people were injured in boston in may when a trolley rearended another trolley the conductor admitted to texting when the crash took place and last month , a subway train rearended another in washington , killing nine
it has come to this germany will almost certainly have a bigger budget deficit next year than italy will traditionally , germany is the continent s keeper of fiscal rectitude , perpetually fretting that the italians and other freespending southern europeans are about to undermine and rekindle inflation by not reducing their red ink but in 2010 , the german deficit is expected to total 65 percent of its gross domestic product , while the italian gap is forecast at 62 percent of gdp , according to deutsche bank there is something really odd going on here , with italy being more prudent , spain getting more serious and even the french talking about pension cuts , said gilles mo c of deutsche bank germany is the odd one out it is more than a matter of role reversal the german shift underscores just how profoundly the economic and political situation has changed in berlin , as well as how desperate chancellor is to restore growth in europe s largest economy as she begins her second term given the longstanding aversion to borrowing and spending that has shaped german fiscal policy since the great hyperinflation of the weimar era during the 1920s , mrs merkel and her new finance minister , wolfgang sch uble , have set off a fierce debate by proposing to cut taxes by 24 billion euro , or 359 billion , in 2010 and 2011 , rather than immediately attack the country s projected budget gap i want us to do everything we can to create the conditions for new , stronger growth , mrs merkel said tuesday , laying out her agenda in a speech before the bundestag in berlin without growth , there will be no investment without growth , no jobs without growth , no money for education without growth , no help for the weak cutting taxes now and balancing budgets later is a highwire act for all politicians , of course , and the new german government is divided even within its own ranks over the wisdom of lowering taxes to stimulate the economy but it is a sign of just how painful the recession has been across the continent , especially germany , that officials in berlin and elsewhere in europe are so reluctant to reduce borrowing anytime soon because of the risk of harming the incipient recovery like germany , much of europe is struggling with how to gradually withdraw economic stimulus efforts without compounding stillrising unemployment or throwing their economies back into recession the terms of the treaty that created the euro currency are supposed to limit each country s deficit to no more than 3 percent of its gdp none of the 16 countries that use the euro are expected to meet that goal soon , however , with the typical budget deficit projected to reach a record 69 percent of gdp next year , according to the european commission on wednesday , the commission is expected to give germany , france and spain until 2013 to return their budget gaps to below 3 percent but it is not clear whether any of them can achieve that goal for mrs merkel , who strenuously opposed a europewide stimulus package during the depth of the financial crisis last year , the change of approach has been difficult to accept germany has been a kind of symbol for europe of caution and prudence when it comes to spending , said alfred boss , an economist and specialist in german politics at the , who added that berlin s new proposals are not typically german there seems to be a kind of attitude that the tax cuts will finance themselves , he argued it s nonsense it s an attitude prevailing in the us , but this kind of thinking seems to be stronger in the new government indeed , a few prominent german politicians have started echoing the supplyside arguments propounded by former president ronald reagan and his economists in washington in the 1980s and carried forward by the republican party ever since particularly because the coffers are empty we need fair taxes to jumpstart the economic engine so that more money flows into state coffers , the head of the free democratic party , guido westerwelle , said in an interview with the german newspaper bild others within the government are trying to thread the needle more finely even as mrs merkel laid out her economic plan in berlin , mr sch uble told a european union meeting of finance ministers in brussels that a strict budget policy would allow berlin to combine tax cuts with deficit reduction over the next four years but for all the efforts to keep everybody on board , mrs merkel could be on a collision course with much of the business community , as well as axel a weber , the head of the deutsche bundesbank , who sits on the governing council of the european central bank in frankfurt in a speech last month , mr weber set 2011 as a crucial deadline for europe to begin digging out of the stimulus measures and deficit spending now under way given the enormous rise in public deficits and the strain this will put on future budgets , the fiscal exit strategy will have to kick in as soon as the recovery has firmed up , which means no later than 2011 , he said among ordinary germans , the desire for fiscal discipline still runs deep as well , setting the stage for further tensions down the road if the economy lags a poll published last month by forsa , the independent polling institute , showed that only 22 percent wanted tax cuts if they would lead to a wider budget deficit and more public borrowing nearly 70 percent were against the idea moreover , a new law limits federal deficits to 035 percent of gross domestic product from 2016 onward and no longer allows the federal states to run deficits at all from 2020 onward but prof markus heintzen , economics professor at the free university in berlin , reckons such targets will now be very difficult to meet traditionally , inflation , that has been more important to germans than government borrowing , professor heintzen said but now , look at the way the states and local governments have run up huge debts and deficits the public knows it is worrying

london was it something in the air \? was it something in the food \? was it some unspeakable organism lurking evilly on a countertop or skulking under a plate \? whatever it was , it has caused hundreds of people in the past month to report becoming violently sick with projectile vomiting , sudden diarrhea and flulike symptoms after eating at the in bray , berkshire the fat duck , which has three michelin stars and is perhaps britain s most celebrated restaurant , has closed the outbreak s cause remains a mystery britain s health protection agency said it was testing the food , testing the people who had become ill and conducting a risk assessment of all food storage , preparation and cooking processes it is testing for bacteria , viruses , patterns in the sick people s symptoms and in the food they ate and , for good measure , testing other diners , whether or not they got sick they 're looking for a bug , said phillip bicknell , a local government official , something that s causing the sickness , that may well be attached to the restaurant , inside or outside , or to the staff who work there , or to a customer who came in the restaurant s reopening depends on when the testing is completed the restaurant s owner , the celebrity chef , decided to close it on feb 24 after about 40 diners said they had become ill after eating there as news of the outbreak has spread , about 400 people in all have reported being sickened from late january through most of february mr blumenthal declined to comment but a spokeswoman said that none of the tests had so far proved conclusive the british news media have speculated that mr blumenthal could be losing as much as 140 , 000 a week , merely in lost reservations a regular dinner at this small restaurant in the country costs about 140 , without wine the tasting menu costs about 185 mr blumenthal said last week that he felt dreadful , absolutely dreadful , and that closing the restaurant had been an incredibly emotional decision , reported the fat duck is considered one of the world s most innovative practitioners of molecular gastronomy , which uses science and technology to invent new forms and combinations of food \( mr blumenthal prefers the term sensory design \) although his menu includes semiconventional dishes , mr blumenthal is perhaps best known for items like snail porridge and nitroscrambled egg and bacon \( served with tea jelly \) his sound of the sea dish includes seafood , foam and what some reviewers have called edible sand it is served alongside a conch shell with an ipod in it , so diners can listen to wave and seagull sounds as they eat mr blumenthal is known for professionalism and meticulous attention to detail he told the bbc that the restaurant regularly conducted its own tests everything is tested , from the food coming out of the ground , from the farm , into the kitchen and to the customer , he said he also owns a pub in bray , but no one has gotten sick there , said mr bicknell , the local official richard harden , the coeditor of in london , said he could not think of a similar case in 18 years of following the restaurant industry but like many others , he speculated that the diners might have come down with , a highly contagious type of , or norwalklike virus , that has been cutting a swath through britain it has been particularly virulent in schools and hospitals dr steve field , chairman of the royal college of general practitioners , said that the reported symptoms seemed more in line with the vomiting illness than with , say , food poisoning if just one person in the restaurant had it , he said , it could have been passed quickly to everyone else mr bicknell said that funnily enough , i had this sickness and diarrhea last weekend , and the last time i ate at the fat duck was about five years ago he added i ca n't speculate , and at the end of the day the tests will show the answer one way or another but if you want to suggest that my symptoms are the same as those being reported , that would have an element of truth in it

washington top lobbyists for the banking industry were gathered in a war council the obama administration had proposed big changes in financial industry oversight , including a consumer protection commission and regulation of some executives' paychecks the lobbyists listened to presentations from big washington public affairs firms ready to deploy arsenals including television commercials and directmail campaigns but at the end of the meeting , the lobbyists publicly opted to emphasize , if with caveats , their industry s backing of s broader call for reform steve bartlett , president of the and a participant in the discussion , said in an interview , this administration has reminded us of the lesson our mother taught us if you ca n't say anything nice , do n't say anything at all and so it goes the length of k street industry groups and lobbyists typically hostile to intrusive government programs have been professing solidarity with mr obama and his agenda on matters like health care , energy and industry has calculated that it stands a better chance of achieving its ends by negotiating with the white house than by fighting it at least publicly , and at least until the various proposals get down to the final details for partisans who are more ideological , the parade of industry lobbyists trooping to the white house is unnerving conservatives fret that to avoid a messy fight , their business allies are selling out too cheaply , while liberals voice the same worry about the white house and its congressional supporters some lobbyists argue that all the kumbaya , as several called it , may be reaching its final chorus , for instance with banks' efforts to redirect the regulatory overhaul we have sort of a dual goal , mr bartlett said one is to support comprehensive reform , and the other is to kill the consumer financial protection commission in any case , the administration s emphasis on inviting in business lobbyists has arguably changed the way washington does business as much as any of the white house s new rules intended to shut them out the obama people have very skillfully said , hey , we are working on this , and if you want a seat at the table you ca n't be out there throwing rocks at us , ' said doug goodyear , chief executive of , a corporate public affairs firm and that has restrained large corporations or trade associations from waging fullscale campaigns in the last two weeks , the has endorsed the house s version of the health care overhaul , and lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies and forprofit hospitals have stood with the white house to pledge billions in cost cuts so long as the proposed public health insurance program does not threaten to undercut them the drug companies are even underwriting television commercials supporting an overhaul lobbyists for coalpowered electric utilities say they are backing house emissionscap legislation as it moves to the senate , so long as they can perhaps loosen the caps a bit and retain subsidies that the house provided to win their support lockheed martin publicly washed its hands of any lobbying to save its contract from pentagon cuts , then watched as its unions , subcontractors and congressional allies persuaded house committees to restore the plane \( the white house is threatening a veto \) and wall street firms insist that they welcome more oversight , so long as it does not cramp their profits or involve checks on compensation conservatives complain that the support for reform deprives them of firepower disgusting , said amy menefee of the conservative group  ms menefee s organization recently announced a 12 million advertising campaign against the health care overhaul , but she said none of that campaign s cost was being paid by the industry similarly , patrick creighton , a spokesman for the oilindustrybacked , said that group had been unable to finance a full assault on the greenhousegas emissions limits the alliance wound up spending only about 200 , 000 , for radio commercials in 10 districts , before the bill passed the house , mr creighton said why did n't the floodgates open \? he said because a lot of industry was at the table looking for their cutouts and carveouts that is , special treatment liberals , meanwhile , say they fear that the white house and democratic congressional leaders are conceding too much the house emissions bill , for example , gave away as sweeteners about 85 percent of the emissions permits that mr obama had proposed to sell at auction representative ra l m grijalva , democrat of arizona and cochairman of the congressional progressive caucus , called the emissions bill a cautionary lesson for the health care fight collaboration can turn into concessions , said mr grijalva , who recently sent the president a letter saying the caucus feared accepting conditions in exchange for the support of hospitals or drug makers the conciliatory tone on k street has combined with the to tamp down lobbying firms' revenue total reported lobbying spending was about 789 million in the first quarter , roughly flat from the corresponding period last year health industry spending rose about 10 percent , to some 126 million , but financial industry spending fell about 7 percent , to 110 million and even in the face of a major overhaul of the pentagon s budget , spending by the defense industry dropped a bit , to roughly 30 million the issues are more complicated , said charles m campion , a founder of the public affairs firm dewey square group , but the budgets are smaller certain lobbyists with strong democratic connections have bucked the revenue tide , though the , whose chairman , tony podesta , is a top democratic fundraiser and the brother of the obama administration s transition chief , john d podesta , reported that firstquarter lobbying fees were up 60 percent , to 54 million , from 34 million a year ago at the firm of , a longtime aide to richard a gephardt , a former house democratic leader , fees jumped nearly 24 percent , to about 16 million mr elmendorf said he encouraged clients to work with the administration look at the landscape , he tells them , and realize the democrats will control the white house , house and senate for at least four years republican lobbyists say they are growing tired with the talk about shared goals how do you oppose such a popular president , especially when he has a style that seems so inviting and sensible \? said ed rogers , a reagan administration official whose lobbying firm , , reported a 13 percent decline in firstquarter fees , to about 41 million a lot of the typical industry players that would , on paper , be against these initiatives , mr rogers said , have been in part coopted and in part intimidated by the administration
somewhere , casey stengel had a twinkle in his eye stengel , the hall of fame manager of the and the , would have surely understood the symbolism of the final play of friday s raucous game at yankee stadium treading into shallow right field , needing only to squeeze a simple popup in his glove to beat the yankees , luis castillo instead made a blooper as humbling as anything his slapstick mets forefathers could have conjured with two outs , runners at first and second and the mets ahead by a run in the ninth , lifted a casual popup to castillo rodriguez knew what it meant game over and he slammed his bat to the dirt i was just frustrated , rodriguez said i got a good fastball to hit , and i popped it straight up but a game ai n't over till it s over , as another manager of both teams , yogi berra , likes to say castillo drifted back for the ball , got into position , and somehow let it squirt from his glove it fell safely to the ground , and derek jeter scored easily castillo might have had a shot to get mark teixeira at the plate , except for one important detail inexplicably , castillo whirled and fired to second , not the plate teixeira scored and the yankees bounced giddily on the grass , winners by 98 as the losing pitcher , francisco rodriguez , stalked off the field the yankees , 26time champions , again had the edge on the mets , who have never quite lived down their hapless beginnings under stengel in 1962 you could see that play a thousand more times and that would never happen , said jeter , whose single started the rally we stole a game today manager sounded more relieved than elated the yankees tried to give the game away , said girardi , who saw his team hand back leads in the third , fourth and seventh innings before david wright broke a 77 tie with a double off mariano rivera in the eighth in the end , though , the game ended with a moral that could have sprung from a matt christopher children s novel always hustle that is what teixeira did , chugging 270 feet for the winning run as the third base coach , rob thomson , guided him home i always do that , because you never know , teixeira said it takes me about 90 feet to get going , but once i got to second base , i was running as hard as i could topper kept waving me , so i just kept running teixeira had reached base on a twoout walk by francisco rodriguez , who fell behind 30 and threw the last ball intentionally four yankees , including teixeira , had already homered to right field , and rodriguez did not want another ball to shoot there teixeira s a guy , with that rightfield porch right there , i do n't want to lose a game like that , he said with arod , mentally , i had a plan to challenge him and move him around the zone that s what i was trying to do the plan would have worked if castillo had caught the ball , which clanged off the heel of his glove for the kind of ending none of the yankees could remember even teixeira said that after sliding into the plate , the first thing he did was ask jeter what had happened i ca n't believe what i saw , alex rodriguez said , nearly channeling jack buck i 've never seen it before what stands out is mark teixeira s hustle that wins the game he s my mvp the mets could say the same about beltran or wright , who have kept them upright despite a barrage of injuries they were immovable objects for rivera , who had issued just one nonintentional walk to his previous 148 batters before beltran took ball four on a full count wright followed by clubbing a 92 mileanhour pitch on one hop to the right field wall , bringing beltran around with the goahead run it made wright 19 for 30 in his last eight games at that point , it had been a sour night for the yankees , who were trying to soften the sting of another sweep this week by the boston red sox their starter , , had posted a pitching line over four innings that was nearly without precedent only one other pitcher since 1954 has allowed at least five walks and two hit batters but no more than one hit in so few innings that pitcher , jamie mcandrew of the 1997 milwaukee brewers , never pitched again in the majors chamberlain has more of a future , but his present is harder to figure he labored through 100 pitches friday and has lasted past six innings just twice this season chamberlain said he lost his aggressiveness it s frustrating , he said , because you know exactly what you were doing wrong yet in a game like this , frustration is all relative chamberlain s was nothing compared to the anguish of castillo it 'll be a battle for him and a battle for us , mets manager jerry manuel said we will stick together we 're here to fight through this inside pitch johnny damon , who dropped a routine fly ball on thursday in boston , had an eye exam friday and was out of the lineup damon , who had 20 10 vision in spring training , said his eyes were fluttering , or blinking too much reliever damaso marte will see dr james andrews , the noted surgeon , for an exam on his ailing left shoulder on monday brian bruney \( elbow \) will pitch for class aa trenton on saturday hideki matsui , who hit a grand slam on his birthday last season , smoked a threerun shot as he turned 35 on friday the yankees did not sell every seat for the first game of the mets series friday , but they came close they sold 47 , 967 tickets , just 304 fewer than for the home opener , which remains the only sellout this season
mexico city as the year began , the dominant political figure of s left appeared to be heading swiftly toward irrelevance but is not dead yet only two years ago , amlo , as he is known , was the driving force in mexico s polarized politics after he narrowly lost the presidency and led months of street protests charging that it had been stolen from him , politics boiled down to one issue who was for him and who was against last year , his hold on public attention began to falter the public , the news media and many of his supporters had simply moved on , letting fade into history but there are signs that the efforts of mr l pez obrador , a former mexico city mayor , to revive his political career may be gaining traction , as a deepening recession creates opportunities for his brand of economic populism the question now is whether he can capitalize on that momentum to remake and expand the coalition that brought him to within a hair s breadth of the presidency at a rally last week in mexico city s immense central square , the z calo , mr l pez obrador , 55 , drew tens of thousands of supporters though the crowd paled beside the hundreds of thousands who attended his rallies at the peak of the 2006 presidential campaign , it was significantly larger than that at any of his rallies in the previous year unlike his campaign events , it was conducted without the benefit of his party s machinery , which used to truck in supporters from around the country , demonstrating a substantial base of hardcore support saying that the economy will only get worse , mr l pez obrador announced a campaign to press the government to cut wasteful spending , lower consumer prices and taxes , and do more for the poor our movement must continue demanding a change in economic policy , which has demonstrated its failure , he said the model must be changed you cannot put new wine in old bottles the words clearly resonated with his poor and workingclass base we think he really can change things , so that people have the right to decide , said aide florentino , 27 , a member of a small garment cooperative in the rural southern part of mexico city it s not important if l pez obrador is the president , said v ctor baltasar , 49 , who traveled to the rally from guadalajara , where he is a supervisor for the city s train system what s important is that things change but rising anxiety over the economy may be broadening his appeal despite government measures aimed at stimulating the economy and buffering households against the worst effects of the crisis , there is a widespread clamor to do more , from constituencies as varied as business groups and poor peasants and fishermen that demand could alter the political calculus mexico is fundamentally a conservative country , said federico est vez , a political analyst at the autonomous technological institute of mexico but in 2009 , the cards are different referring to the left , he said , i think they 're holding a wild card or a couple of aces with the next presidential election three years off , mr l pez obrador s precise ambitions are unclear he calls his new campaign a social movement and clearly aims to be a force to be reckoned with but his relationship with his own party remains fraught last year he lost a battle with a rival faction over the presidency of the party , the party of the democratic revolution , or prd , and he no longer holds any official position in the party or in government the low point came last fall , when most of the senators from his party broke with him to approve an important energy bill , as his supporters scuffled with police officers in an attempt to block the vote to many who had backed his presidential bid , mr l pez obrador s streetbrawling political style had become a liability his campaign to overturn the results of the 2006 election , which he lost by only sixtenths of 1 percent of the total vote to , consisted of mass rallies and a tent city that shut major avenues in the capital for weeks refusing to concede , even after the country s highest electoral court ruled in favor of mr calder n , he held a grand public ceremony in which as the legitimate president of mexico , a title he continues to claim such antics have damaged the party s reputation , officials say jes s ortega , the party president , who defeated mr l pez obrador s choice for the post , said the party s polling showed that twothirds of mexicans identified the prd as disruptive moreover , the polls put the party in third place for midterm elections in july , when voters will elect all 500 members of mexico s lower house , the chamber of deputies the party is currently projected to win 18 percent of the vote , half its showing in 2006 while mr l pez obrador s popularity catapulted it in 2006 from the third largest to the second largest party in congress , the party now stands to lose many of the seats it picked up then mr ortega , while shying away from blaming mr l pez obrador for the decline of the party , made it clear that he wanted to remake its image into that of a party closer to social democratic governing parties in chile and brazil , and that street blockades were not in the plans protests against injustice should not affect citizens' rights , mr ortega said we have to learn to fight within the limits of the law the party has begun running gauzy television spots asking voters for their forgiveness and declaring its willingness to work with other parties , a pointed contrast with mr l pez obrador s campaign of permanent harassment publicly at least , mr l pez obrador and his party say they have worked through their differences analysts say neither one can afford a split if the left as a whole does n't recoup before the elections on the basis of economic issues alone , mr est vez said , then they really have no chance of ever ruling mr l pez obrador needs the structure and resources a large party provides , analysts said and the party cannot jettison its most charismatic politician the prd realizes they ca n't give him up , said daniel m lund , a pollster who has done work for mr l pez obrador , but not since 2004 if the prd breaks with l pez obrador , they will go to single digits where that leaves mr l pez obrador s movement is uncertain although 2012 is a long way off , none of the party s current leaders have anywhere near his largerthanlife stature as a potential presidential contender what is evident is that while talk of a comeback may be premature , so was writing him off he s a charismatic , intuitive politician , said joy langston , an analyst with the cide , a mexico city research institution he not only knows how to win over the masses but also to govern in a way that

hampton , va every crowd makes its own tune massed sports fans burst to celebration and shrink to groans in a rhythm punctuated by a certain detachment political rallies mix earnest approval with dutiful laughs inspired by jibes and cynical selfdeprecation and then there was the noise , the great rising roar that swelled from 13 , 800 throats here at 7 59 on friday evening the unfettered , triumphant cascade of joy heard only at a major rock concert as the house lights dimmed at the hampton coliseum , the four members of officially took the stage for the first time since august 2004 and as the opening passage of the anthem fluffhead enveloped the room , the eruption of exultation was not merely for the band itself but also for the millions in the phish diaspora who make up perhaps the most fervent fandom in pop music it s like our family has n't been able to be together for four and a half years , lauren knyper , 33 , a teacher from babylon , ny , said near the front of the admission line that snaked hundreds of yards behind her before friday s show ms knyper wore a black tshirt that read this is my 100th show , then pointed to her pregnant midsection , and his first ms knyper s husband , who declined to give his name because i'm not supposed to be here , said it was his 217th phish concert we 're here with at least 20someodd friends , ms knyper said for the last four years we 've been missing that connection because this really is a family , and this is our community it s been years since we could be together , so it just has this incredible emotional meaning my mother died just last month , and this is like my music therapy when phish announced in september that it would reunite and play three concerts here , the news instantly rekindled the internetfueled phish fan network within days of the announcement , even before tickets went on sale , every hotel within at least 20 miles was booked solid local officials estimated that as many as 75 , 000 people might have descended on the area for the shows , according to the associated press in the parking lots were license plates from just about every state east of the mississippi and quite a few west of it at kelly s tavern just down the street , nora brendel , 59 , a waitress , heralded the bumper business on saturday afternoon last night they told us , get on your roller skates , girls , ' she said better get some good sleep tonight' it appeared that almost no one at the shows over the weekend paid the face price of 4950 for each night s tickets , and that most fans had ended up paying at least several hundred dollars each in the parking lot , amid the more whimsical offers of snowboards and mud from the band s 2004 farewell festival in coventry , vt , cash offers of 500 for one night s ticket were being routinely ignored by sellers on friday by saturday , the going rate seemed to be around 1 , 000 you could offer me 20 , 000 , and i would n't walk away from these shows , olen green , a 38yearold truck driver from pittsburgh , said as he sat in the first row of the balcony on friday night mr green said he had paid 1 , 265 for his three nights' tickets people say , oh , why are you going to all three shows \? ' but it s really just like one event and those prices were n't for luxury box seats no such thing here in an era of hightech stadiums and fancy amenities , hampton coliseum is among the great oldschool rock arenas one of the few halls of its size still to offer full generaladmission seating with an open floor , hampton is known to rock fans as crowded , sweaty , stinky , smoky , loud and in every respect intense leave your seat without a friend to watch it \? it s gone next to mr green , dave yanaitis , 32 , manager of a service station down the road in virginia beach , va , was jostling for position at the front edge of the balcony hey this is hampton , mr yanaitis said there is no way this crowd can be stopped i would n't call it violent or rough , but it is very energetic , especially with the rush tonight of being the first shows back it can be a little aggressive just because the energy is so high people are n't going to just take your space , but if you 're not here to hold it he shrugged , grinned and gestured at the teeming crowd stretching out before him look at this sea of people during its shows the band engages in almost none of the betweensong banter common to other acts as the musicians progress through intricately scripted passages and wideranging improvisations , the audience generally maintains an intense , attentive , swaying silence the sound quality at hampton is renowned , and the room has long inspired major rock bands to some of their finest concerts by opening its comeback with fluffhead , a beloved song that the band had not played since 2000 , phish inspired comparisons among the cognoscenti to a legendary hampton performance by the grateful dead on oct 9 , 1989 , when that band performed dark star for the first time in five years with its devoted fans and improvisational ambition , phish has long been bound in the popular imagination with the grateful dead , and there is no question that the two bands and their fans share a musical and cultural lineage yet phish fans are generally of a distinctly younger generation though there were very few people who appeared to be over 40 at the shows here , there was a huge bubble of fans in their late 30s , which makes perfect sense , given that phish \( formed at the university of vermont \) first came to prominence on the college and prep school campuses of the northeast in the late 1980s i would go to dead shows , and there would be all these 50yearolds there , which was fine , but i was like 17 , 18 at the time , said brett fairbrother , 37 , a fan who works at the portsmouth brewery in kittery , me then i saw phish , and it was all of these people my own age , so that was where i was meant to be there also were n't many fans under 25 , probably because of the cost , but there were a few young fans lucky enough to make the hampton shows their first i was 5 years old when jerry garcia died , and 13 when coventry happened , so i 've been waiting all my life to come to a show like this , ben cooper , 18 , a high school senior from knoxville , tenn , said on saturday night mr cooper said his family had pooled 900 to buy him tickets as a combined graduation and birthday present among the fans interviewed , the hampton shows won rave reviews , with the nearuniversal opinion that phish now is far tighter and more energetic than the band that toured five or six years ago the group played for about 35 hours each night , and all of the sets are available as free downloads at  an hour after the last concert ended early on monday morning , with the final notes of tweezer reprise , hundreds of fans lingered in the atrium bar of a nearby hotel , holding onto the weekend as if it were the last night of camp , when no one wants to go home they exceeded my expectations from the very first song of the very first show , said erik rankin , 27 , an ad salesman from great neck , ny the first night was like a recital the second night was more ambient , darker and then tonight they just brought the funk phish is back
austin , tex all week , there was plenty of banter about texas seeking revenge against  it stemmed from the thentopranked longhorns' dramatic lastsecond loss in november to the thenseventhranked red raiders on a reception by wide receiver michael crabtree in what was possibly last season s most thrilling game the stunning defeat had dire consequences because it cost texas a chance to play in the bowl championship series title game and probably denied quarterback a heisman trophy but none of the vengeance talk disseminated from the longhorns , now ranked no 2 they , of course , insisted they were focused on saturday against texas tech and not last season s failure as offensive lineman charlie tanner explained earlier in the week , we are texas , this year s motto that players and coaches wear on wristbands and with topranked and defending national champion florida underwhelming in its victory earlier in the day against tennessee , the stage was set before a national television audience saturday night for the longhorns and mccoy to make their cases for no 1 and the heisman trophy yet texas disappointed early before coming alive in the second half and holding off pesky texas tech for a 3424 victory in front of a crowd of 101 , 297 at darrell k royaltexas memorial stadium in a sloppy start to big 12 conference play this season mccoy , last year s runnerup for the heisman , threw for 205 yards and a touchdown , but he also had two interceptions that came on tipped passes after the game , john bianco , texas' assistant athletic director of media relations , said that mccoy missed practice tuesday and was battling the flu we 're a work in progress , texas coach mack brown said we 've got a lot of things to do i'm proud of the way they grew up i'm proud of the way they worked all game but texas' defense made up for mccoy s offnight and had the biggest play of the game in the fourth quarter it came when defensive end sergio kindle flattened texas tech quarterback taylor potts on a blindside hit that forced a fumble the longhorns recovered it at the red raiders' 14 with 11 minutes 49 seconds left i just speed rushed , kindle said of his hit on potts , who finished 46of62 passing for 420 yards and 3 touchdowns the quarterback was there for the taking the violent collision knocked off potts s helmet as he fell afterward , he lay on the field grabbing at his face six plays later , mccoy threw a 3yard touchdown pass to wide receiver dan buckner to extend his team s lead to 3117 texas tech \( 21 , 01 \) added another touchdown later that was answered by a texas field goal , but there would be no crabtreelike heroics for the red raiders give credit to the defense , mccoy said sometimes , not everything s going to go our way although texas failed to make a statement saturday , its win was instrumental in the big 12 south race hyped in the preseason as the nation s best division , it has been disappointing after earlyseason losses by the former top10 teams oklahoma and oklahoma state texas \( 30 , 10 \) and texas am \( 20 \) are now the division s only undefeated teams the longhorns host texasel paso and colorado before playing oklahoma on oct 17 in dallas in a game expected to be filled with offensive fireworks , the first half was an oddity there were no offensive touchdowns , and the lone touchdown came on a 46yard punt return by texas' jordan shipley before shipley s score , texas tech led by 30 after a 41yard field goal on the game s first possession texas added a 43yard field goal early in the second quarter for a 103 halftime advantage we did not handle that in the first half , mccoy said of texas tech s defense but in the second half we came out and played pretty well texas' victory certainly lacked style points , and it seemed to show on the faces of the longhorns after the game but texas actually had reason to celebrate the longhorns had survived against texas tech , which they failed to do last season that is plenty of revenge for a team that lives to remain in the national title chase for another week it is survival , brown said it s not playoffs it s not anything else it is survival we did n't survive for one half last year and got disappointed
after leaving art school in the 1960s , fred holland embarked on a long and substantial career as a performer , collaborating with writerchoreographers like meredith monk and ishmael houstonjones and creating dances of his own and maybe this background explains features of the sculpture and painting he returned to in the 1990s their use of ephemeral materials and metaphoric narrative and their ability to deliver difficult content with apparent effortlessness for a 1999 solo show at gallery x in harlem \( founded by the turkish artist gulsun erbil and now closed \) , mr holland created an installation on a big theme the circleswithincircles structure of cosmic and personal history using found and perishable materials solarized prints made with onion slices on paper became planetary charts blackeyed peas stuck on a bluepainted wall were spiral nebulae the rings of an old tree trunk , inscribed with tiny names in pencil , became a record of his southern family going back generations the larger part of the tilton show is also an installation of several pieces , each shaped with care on night walks through his manhattan neighborhood over the past few years , mr holland collected castoff pieces of medical equipment wheelchairs , walkers , commodes associated with infirmity and old age he painstakingly recreated each of them from cutout strips of soft powderblue styrofoam joined together with glue and pins unlike the originals , his aids for the weak are of an absurd delicacy they bend at a touch a breeze could knock them over far from giving support , they require it other sculptures in the show underscore the idea of physical frailty in colon i , hung high on a wall , human viscera are reduced to a coil of rough rope squeezed into a transparent box with the one loose end hanging down in another piece a plaster head faces the wall and weeps long strings of tissuepink plastic pearls a third sculpture , so small as to escape immediate notice , seems to be in the shape of some vital organ , a kidney or a heart , but is painted with gold leaf and bristles with small , arterial armlike branches here again mr holland goes for the poetry of the humble the gold object is a common yam , a dietary staple in africa much like the sweet potatoes in the africanamerican home of mr holland s childhood even after being dug from the earth , this root vegetable continues to grow , sending out sprouts , as the gilded one at tilton does , bringing full circle the theme of mortality and resurrection that lifts this beautiful show dan fischer s art could be called retroappropriation instead of rephotographing photographs like a cardcarrying postmodernist , he painstakingly converts them into graphite drawings the compressed velvetiness and devotional air of these small works go against the grain of most postmodernism , yet except for the small patches of grid that indicate the artist s handiwork , they can almost be mistaken for photographs the images mr fischer copies are wellknown photographs of famous 20thcentury artists and artworks that play off one another postmodern irony is represented by shots of marcel duchamp , francis picabia and richard prince impassioned sincerity has its advocates in piet mondrian , marsden hartley , alfred stieglitz and louise bourgeois somehow the twain meet in a drawing based on an unusual photograph of franz kline in a sleeveless shirt that makes his head seem collaged onto an oddly feminine body the artworks whose images mr fischer converts to drawings include umberto boccioni s large bronze 1913 sculpture of a striding man its title , unique forms of continuity in space , is also the show s title mr fischer establishes continuities by transforming related photographs into unique forms duchamp s original urinal , with a hartley painting behind it , is the subject of one drawing elaine sturtevant s reiteration of the duchamp appears in another a shot of constantin brancusi in his studio includes a bird in flight ms bourgeois appears a second time with a marble sculpture that resembles a flock of brancusi birds a selfportrait that duchamp created when he was 58 and made up to look 85 resonates with a photograph of mr prince in a suit and makeup , looking androgynous the show s most beautiful image is a form of continuity unto itself a wall of mondrian s new york studio , where paintings , shelves and tackedup squares of color form an irregular grid of grays so subtly modulated they might as well be colored josephine halvorson s small realist paintings seem to have it both ways they neither function as windows on an illusionistic world , nor do they foster the absolute agreement of flat image and flat surface basic to , say , a jasper johns flag or target instead , ms halvorson s works usually painted from one sitting hold steady in the middle with closely cropped , relaxed renderings of shallow , boxedoff volumes and forms that are forthright but not so simple her images and canvases almost agree in the way that her colors frequently approach monochrome but never absolutely they husband identifiable details , illusionistic space , tonal contrasts and , especially , the effects of real light and shadow still , her depictions of a paneled door , a decaying tombstone , the side of a woodburning stove and a segment of an organ s doubledecker keyboard are essentially modernist monochromes of everyday life to complicate matters , it is the everyday life of a particular premodern american sort noticeably old and tweaked by titles that add further vibrations ms halvorson s idea of a whiteonwhite abstraction is a closeup of an oldfashioned white dress it is titled concrete chest , which can make words like sculpture , confirmation , puberty , mass production and maybe lawn ornament buzz through your mind in confusion the implicitly deconstructive coral is nothing but the parched skeleton of a bush displayed in a box the title refers to the box s painted interior while the branches of the bush suggest the natural form of a branch of coral the plain and empty shaker shelf is like a frontier donald judd box seen at a slight angle , its edges are subtly offsquare with those of the canvas its interior is bisected by shadows that complicate its geometries and basic browns ms halvorson s art adds , as yet infinitesimally but credibly , to visions of late manet , morandi and william nicholson , all of whom enlivened pure painting with reality why is hard to say , but a lot of interesting painting is bobbing around in today s recessionary waters one kind that you do n't see a lot of , however , is realism , which makes it potentially the most interesting approach just because it is so unfashionable a case in point is the work of joseph santore exhibiting solo for the first time since 2001 , mr santore , 63 , has evidently backed down from the kind of bigscale , awesomely ambitious painting he has favored on canvases ranging from 6 inches square to 3 by 3 feet , he has been painting stilllifes and selfportraits with a tender touch , a sharply observant eye and a spider s patience , and without photographic aids the largest and most impressive picture is garden , a bird seye view of tables overloaded with all sorts of studio flotsam and jetsam , including potted plants , glasses and bottles , furniture parts , masks , tools and much more crammed edge to edge with all this carefully detailed stuff , the canvas offers an absorbing , allover field of painterly activity and a nearly surrealistic vividness in smaller , more orderly compositions , mr santore exercises a keen sense of color , as in cyclamen , in which red blossoms and darkgreen leaves resonate against a scarlet wall a feeling of selfless care for ordinary things and for the act of painting in these works calls to mind the great french stilllife painter chardin mr santore s selfportraits are more conventional , but like his stilllifes , they are a blessed respite from the manic distractions and disturbing spectacles of modern life since 1971 the mckee gallery has mounted numerous exhibitions of philip guston s work , but none have featured the small panels that guston painted in between 1969 and 1973 now 45 of these works form a single row around the gallery and rehearse in miniature the themes , images and offhand brushwork that dominated guston s large paintings of the early and mid1970s their motifs alternate between the locales generally known as art and life art , of course , is the studio , indicated by as little as a bare light bulb or solitary coffee mug , or by paint cans accompanied by an ashtray some depict small framed paintings of high horizon lines the deluges and high seas that guston would populate with bobbing heads in larger works others depict fresh , unframed canvases hanging precariously on easels as thick as trees perhaps guston , who was goodsized , saw some silliness in working on canvases not much larger than his hand one painting is a simple grisaille image of a tall , narrow armchair it recalls the one that c zanne used in his early portraits of his father and the dwarf achille emperaire life is an unnamed , minimally indicated town of modest skyscrapers populated by white triangles of sheethooded heads with electric outlets for eyes these are the seemingly hapless , defanged descendants of the ku klux klan figures from guston s paintings of the late 1930s and early '40s still , they ride around in cars , talk conspiratorially and lurk near chimneys and behind brick walls in other paintings clubs poke above these walls , indicating unfriendly congregations , while recurring images of upturned feet suggest lonely victims these works seem almost asking to be arranged into a logical narrative but do n't underestimate the sense they already make
the number of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender characters has grown in recent years on primetime network television , but decreased on cable , the gay lesbian alliance against defamation said for its recently published where we are on tv study , the alliance reviewed 79 scripted comedies and dramas announced to air on the broadcast networks during the 20092010 season , and found that of 600 series regulars on these shows , 18 are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender the study said that abc has the most such characters , with 8 out of 168 total series regulars fox has four \( including cartoon characters from the simpsons and american dad \) , nbc has three , cw has two and cbs has none in its review of mainstream cable channels , including hbo , showtime , comedy central , amc and others , the alliance found that the number of series regulars who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender decreased this year to 25 from 32 last year when the gayoriented cable channels here ! and logo were accounted for , the study said , an additional 27 such characters were added to the tally
with the basketball in his hands , orlando s jameer nelson performs the twoman twostep that the magic and the entire have sought to perfect his eyes dart , his mind absorbs , his feet react as his teammate dwight howard sets a pick and rolls to the basket , initiating a chain reaction designed to produce defensive mayhem no other play in the nba creates such havoc , no other play is used as often the basic pickandroll is the bread and butter of the nba , with two teammates working in conjunction on offense , with one player dribbling the ball and the other standing still and trying to block the path of the ball handler s defender as all hoopsters know , once the pick , or screen , is carried out , the ball handler can pursue several options pass the ball to his teammate who set the pick and is now rolling toward the basket or another space on the floor take a shot himself drive to the basket or pass the ball to another teammate who may be open when it comes down to it , that s what we 're going to be in when the game s on the line , magic coach stan van gundy said of basketball s most reliable play i say it all the time i do n't care how good you are , you ca n't take away everything the pickandroll is the play of choice for some of the league s best players , like new orleans s chris paul , phoenix s steve nash , miami s dwyane wade and cleveland s lebron james the league s dependence on the play is steadily increasing , according to a fiveyear analysis by , which logs every nba game , providing analytics to nearly every team use of the pickandroll rose to 186 percent of the league s total plays last season from 156 percent in 20045 , when synergy began tracking it the nba has largely turned away from relying on power players in favor of uptempo offense the pickandroll allows that , while creating offensive opportunities early in the 24second shot clock nba rule changes have encouraged pickandrolls , cracking down on defensive hand checks that could slow players like nelson the synergy analysis created a statistical portrait of the play s use in the nba and revealed the following the and the used the play the least in the nba last season only 11 percent of their offensive plays originated with the pickandroll with wade as the main conduit , the used the pickandroll the most in last year s regular season the play originated in 26 percent of its total offense the heat was followed by the \( 25 percent \) and \( 24 percent \) the \( surprisingly given mike d'antoni s fondness for disrupting defenses \) placed 24th over all at 16 percent nelson , who is currently sidelined for at least a month with a knee injury , was the most effective pickandroll player last season , according to synergy he averaged 115 points in offense generated for either himself or a teammate each time he ran the pickandroll during an injuryshortened regular season james was second at 11 paul posted a 108 nash had a 106 it s sort of like a fast break where you get a numbers advantage , said garrick barr , who is the chief executive of synergy and who previously spent 11 years as the ' video coordinator pickandrolls create a halfcourt advantage as teams rely more on the pickandroll , the traditional postup game has diminished the number of offensive plays derived from postups dropped in the same five years from 134 percent to 107 percent last season , according to the report perhaps the most enlightening revelation in all this is that the jazz uses the pickandroll so sparingly deron williams and carlos boozer are viewed as extensions of john stockton and karl malone , the retired utah stars who became the pickandroll s most notable tandem in the nba jerry sloan coached both pairs of players , but utah s offense now revolves around cuts and reads everybody just associates pickandrolls with us because of john and karl , williams said they ran it out a lot , but similar to us we run it toward the end of the game when we need baskets , but we try to execute our offense first sloan said you 've got to learn how to play other ways than just strictly pickandroll most of the time , other guys are just standing in the pickandroll we try to run other stuff where they 're not standing and stay active in other parts of the game meanwhile , the lakers use coach phil jackson s triangle offense to spread the floor he has two traditional power players in pau gasol and andrew bynum , and most of kobe bryant s offense is generated through isolation plays the pickandroll is not much of a factor but over all , the synergy numbers confirm what many in the nba have witnessed offenses now spread defenses thin with mobile big men , quick point guards and longdistance shooters the pickandroll is the orchestrator of all that it is also the formula that the magic used as it made its way to the nba finals last season the pickandroll allows howard , the game s most athletic center , to gain position in the post on the move that way , he can step in and get the ball deep in the post and step in and score , nelson said and we can use it for our shooters to create shots for others and myself nba teams use various methods to combat the pickandroll , although none are highly effective the defender guarding the ball handler can squeeze past the player setting the pick to stay with the ball handler \( known as going over the pick \) he can also try to avoid the pick by running behind the pick and then resume guarding the ball handler once he moves past the screen \( known as going under the pick \) the two defenders can also switch whom they are guarding , with the taller defender momentarily defending the smaller ball handler and trying to hinder his vision before hurrying back to the player who set the pick or the defender guarding the ball handler can try to direct him away from the pick before it can take place the strategy varies team to team , night to night the synergy analysis showed that defenses were most effective when the onball defender went under the pick , temporarily abandoning the ball handler and then picking him up again for example , when the defender went under the pick against james , he averaged 093 points when james was played over the pick , he averaged 102 points yet a majority of teams played over the pick they defended that way , barr said , to show defensive aggressiveness instead of passiveness , even if it hurt them in the long run with effective teams , the defensive strategies are limited there are just too many options with the pickandroll , too many height and quickness mismatches for the offense to take advantage of the defensive thought process turns simple , if futile sometimes , it just hopes that the team running the pickandroll misses whatever shot it chooses to take if it s tim duncan rolling to the basket , you want to take tim duncan away with your help , coach eddie jordan said now , if you have tony parker and tim duncan , you have to stop the ball , which is tony parker , and you 've got to give help , so you 're leaving somebody open probably , manu ginobili for a 3 you have to pick your poison
a report by the european union on last year s brief but nasty war between russia and georgia confirms what we have long suspected everyone is to blame georgia is to blame because its blustering president , mikheil saakashvili , initiated a foolhardy attack into south ossetia russia because it bullied and goaded mr saakashvili and then used the attack as an excuse to invade georgia the united states because it tacitly encouraged mr saakashvili for far too long and europe because it did nothing at all none of that may be surprising but is still worth reading as an anatomy of a postsoviet mess that was allowed to fester for too long and could erupt again unless all sides show a lot more sense unfortunately , neither the russians nor the georgians seem interested in learning anything despite the report s findings that the russian invasion was already under way when it decided to send in its own troops georgia s ambassador to the european union said that if the investigators did n't think georgia s citizens deserved protection then that s a matter of opinion the russian government insisted that the report had vindicated its actions , but it rejected the finding that its army used disproportionate force and accused the european union of a continuing bias what these governments should be paying attention to is the report s real bottom line everybody lost more than a year later , an estimated 30 , 000 people , mostly ethnic georgians , are still displaced georgia is divided russia s recognition of the independence of two rebel provinces , south ossetia and abkhazia , poses a lasting obstacle to better relations with the west the only way to repair the damage and head off another fight is for both sides to clean up their acts the kremlin will have to stop looking for ways to provoke georgia and abandon , once and for all , its imperial ambitions georgia s leaders need to figure out that their best chance of recovering their lost provinces is by making the idea of a union with a democratic georgia , one respectful of minority rights , a lot more attractive the united states and the european union also need to learn that heading off conflicts before they erupt is a lot easier than trying to pick up the pieces afterward
moscow does the taganrog automobile factory have a deal for you ! rows of freshly minted hyundai santa fe sport utility vehicles are available right now in exchange well , do you have any circuit boards \? or sheet metal \? or sneakers \? here is a sign of the financial times in barter is back on the table advertisements are beginning to appear in newspapers and online , like one that offered 2 , 500 , 000 rubles' worth of premium underwear for any automobile , and another promising lumber in krasnoyarsk for food or medicine a crane manufacturer in yekaterinburg is paying its debtors with excavators and one of russia s original commodities traders , , has rolled out a splashy anticrisis initiative that he says will link long chains of enterprises in a worldwide barter system all this evokes a bit of d j vu in the mid1990s , barter transactions in russia accounted for an astonishing 50 percent of sales for midsize enterprises and 75 percent for large ones the practice kept businesses afloat for years but also allowed them to defer some fundamental changes needed to make them more competitive , like layoffs and price reductions it also hurt tax revenues the comeback is on a small scale so far the most recent statistics available , from november , showed that barter deals made up about 3 to 4 percent of total sales , according to , an independent bulletin nevertheless , economists are taking note russians are so arrogant that they never cut prices , said vladimir popov , a professor at moscow s new economic school by turning to barter systems during an economic downturn , he said , you are hiding your head in the sand it would be hard , however , to dissuade business owners who see barter as a point of light on a bleak financial horizon among the most upbeat of them is mr sterligov , who , just as the credit crunch brought most business deals to a halt , shoveled 13 million into the  mr sterligov , 42 , is one of the great characters of russian capitalism in his mid20s , on the eve of the soviet union s collapse , he was a freewheeling , chainsmoking commodities trader surrounded by leggy assistants but mr sterligov sat out the oilfueled prosperity of recent years after a failed run against vladimir v putin in the 2004 presidential election , he retreated to a log house outside moscow , opting for the beard and boots of a russian shepherd in august , intimations of the financial crash lured him out of the woods he plans to use a computer database to create chains of six or seven enterprises having difficulty selling their products for cash , in which the last firm on the chain would pay the first in a single cash transaction it is the kind of multiparty barter that rose to prominence in the 1990s , when managers of factories across russia devised complex barter chains to keep the maximum number of enterprises in business when none had cash to pay their bills a computer , he said , can do the same job faster and more efficiently what was in the past will remain in the past , mr sterligov said in an interview last month , from the 26thfloor suite he has rented in a moscow highrise we are making a step into the future so far , economists doubt that barter will grow to the level it reached in the 1990s earlier in the transition to a market economy , industrialists still had little monetary stake in their businesses but were dependent on the prestige that went with executive positions , said andrei yakovlev of the higher school of economics here they had little incentive to cut costs , and barter deals kept them going for five years , he said now , business owners and managers are really trying to reduce costs and reduce inefficiency , mr yakovlev said interest in barter , he said , is more likely to come from regional governments , which have the most to lose from high unemployment barter is a side effect of tight monetary policy , said mr popov , who is teaching at carleton university in ottawa russia is in the grip of a liquidity crisis as in the mid1990s , the government has made it a priority to shore up the economy by buying up rubles , hoping to avoid the panicky selloff that comes with rapid devaluation the ruble has gradually slid from 234 to the dollar in early august , before russia s war in georgia , to 362 to the dollar last week as a result , the money supply continues to contract , and some enterprises turn to barter to survive we are stepping for the second time on the same rake , mr popov said the second time is a greater sin longterm macroeconomic trends , however , are the last thing manufacturers were thinking about in recent weeks the hyundai factory in taganrog , the southern seaport where chekhov was born , rolled out a , offering to trade vehicles for raw materials , hightech equipment or other liquid goods , including finished products of various branches of industry gleb korotkov , a spokesman for the factory , said he could not be specific about what goods were meant , saying it was a commercial secret barter deals seem to be spreading fastest in construction industries dmitri smorodin , who runs a large st petersburg building firm , said he thought for two months before announcing in late january that he was willing to accept barter items including food products as payment for construction work he said he hoped that adopting the strategy early in the crisis would give him an edge over his competitors food we would happily accept , because it s easy to sell , he said of course , money is always preferable in contrast , uralchem , a fertilizer producer , refused payment in grain and beef , because the company conforms to international financial reporting standards in its reports to shareholders , said andrei kocherov , a spokesman for uralchem , which was founded in 2007 the modern accounting system would preclude barter , he said meanwhile , in bashkortostan , a republic in southwestern russia , local development officials publicly encouraged businesses to develop barter chains sergei ryazanov , 30 , a businessman from the siberian city of surgut , took out an advertisement a month ago offering to barter excess metal piping so far , he has not been impressed by the offers he has received he said people were not desperate enough to drop prices he is looking for a truly liquid commodity , something universal , like gasoline even underwear , which , he said , is much more liquid than automobiles he was intrigued by mr sterligov s idea , though he questioned the wisdom of planning a career in barter it will take him a couple years to get it right , mr ryazanov said and then , in two years , liquidity will be back
in a shocking genuflection to the gun lobby , the senate has voted to deny amtrak its indispensable 16 billion federal subsidy unless it allows passengers to transport handguns in their checked luggage the budget support would be stripped in six months unless amtrak scraps the gun ban that it wisely adopted five years ago after the terrorist railroad atrocities in madrid was bipartisan and not even close , with 27 democrats and one independent \( the ultraliberal bernie sanders from gunfriendly vermont \) joining all 40 republicans versus 30 opponents the hope is that the house or president obama will ultimately reject the amtrak measure , but securitywary citizens cannot count on that as the gun lobby choreographs political cravenness the budget cudgel was approved despite pleas from amtrak that it lacks the manpower , equipment and extra financing to effectively meet the deadline and that it faces a shutdown if federal funds are lost among other changes , baggage cars would have to be securely retrofitted and manpower increased the warning cut no ice with the majority as the chief sponsor , senator roger wicker , a republican of mississippi , intoned a lockstep mantra americans should not have their second amendment rights restricted for any reason proponents said the change was needed to put amtrak back to its pre9 11 gun policy and equate it with airline security measures that allow unloaded , locked handguns in checked baggage this is lunatic reasoning for a nation supposedly sensitized by the 9 11 attacks why should gun owners be treated as privileged travelers \? amtrak has none of the hermetic procedures where airport passengers are screened shoeless at detectors while their checked baggage is separately secured trains stop at stations and passengers come and go amtrak presently has a system of checking passengers and screening baggage at random , much the way new york police monitor mass transit if the senate wants to pass a bill on amtrak , it should provide the money to hire more security guards and create a real passenger rail system generally , it should just stop its demeaning homage to the gun lobby
seattle the says it has opened an inquiry into a claim that one of its employees spent more than two years infiltrating antiwar groups active near one of the nation s largest military bases the groups say the employee infiltrated their activities under an assumed name and gained access to their plans as well as names and email addresses of some members the man , john j towery , a civilian employee at fort lewis , south of tacoma , wash , works as a criminal intelligence analyst for the post s force protection division , say officials at fort lewis , the nation s third largest army post the army would not disclose the nature of the investigation or address the claim that mr towery had shared information about civilians it said mr towery was not available for an interview mr john towery performs sensitive work within the installation law enforcement community , and it would not be appropriate for him to discuss his duties with the media , the army said in written statement fort lewis is aware of the claim with regard to mr towery to ensure all regulatory guidelines were followed , the command has decided that an inquiry is prudent , and an officer is being appointed to conduct the inquiry brendan maslauskas dunn said he met mr towery in spring 2007 , when mr maslauskas dunn became involved with port militarization resistance , a group that has frequently tried to disrupt military shipments in olympia , tacoma and other ports nearby mr maslauskas dunn , who was also active in at least one other group , students for a democratic society , said mr towery had identified himself as john jacob , using his middle name as his last he said he worked as a civilian at fort lewis doing computer support , mr maslauskas dunn said mr towery , he said , frequently attended protests but had not been among those who agreed in advance that they would be willing to be arrested he said mr towery had often worked as a watcher who tracked law enforcement at the protests at one point early on , mr maslauskas dunn said , mr towery brought at least one of his children to an event he said mr towery often spent time at a meeting place for anarchists in tacoma mr maslauskas dunn and another member of the group , drew hendricks , said that mr towery had been among a handful of people who ran email lists for some of the groups and that this had given him access to names and email addresses mr maslauskas dunn said mr towery would sometimes call group members while he was at work at fort lewis and provide information about the movements of some units and equipment a lot of information he did give us was easily accessible online , mr maslauskas dunn said you just had to do a little research mr hendricks said he and other group members did not accept classified information if it was offered by people in the military mr hendricks , who said he lived in olympia and repaired printers for a living , said mr towery had drawn his suspicion more than once in the past , including after he posted inaccurate information about a military movement on an activist web site yet he and mr maslauskas dunn , who said he worked as a janitor at a lumber mill in shelton , wash , said mr towery s identity was inadvertently discovered after a public records request made with the city of olympia the request yielded an email message mr towery had sent to another person with a military address relating to the protesters' activities that led mr hendricks and other group members to try to determine who mr towery was after they learned it was the man they had known as mr jacob , they discussed it at city council meeting in olympia last week and posted the information on a web site mr maslauskas dunn said that in a meeting last week , mr towery told him and another group member that he was not reporting information to fort lewis and that he genuinely wanted to join the peace movement but was under pressure to share some information about protesters with local law enforcement authorities what he said is that the world is n't just in black and white , that there are areas of gray and that it s in those areas of gray that he lives his life , mr maslauskas dunn said he said mr towery told them that the army had reassigned him , at least temporarily , and that he was being investigated for espionage mr maslauskas dunn and mr hendricks said they were skeptical of suggestions that mr towery might have infiltrated the group purely on his own , as a socalled renegade without army approval stephen dycus , a professor at vermont law school who focuses on national security issues , said the army was prohibited from conducting law enforcement among civilians except in very rare circumstances , none of which immediately appeared to be relevant to the fort lewis case mr dycus said several statutes and rules also prohibited the army from conducting covert surveillance of civilian groups for intelligence purposes infiltration is a really big deal , he said he said it raises fundamental questions about the role of the military in american society catherine caruso , a spokeswoman for fort lewis , said in a written statement that the fort lewis force protection division , under the directorate of emergency services , consists of both military and civilian employees whose focus is on supporting law enforcement and security operations to ensure the safety and security of fort lewis , soldiers , family members , the work force and those personnel accessing the installation
i guess you can t always get what you want at least this seems to be the case for my financial aid packages this week i got the package i had been waiting for from savannah college of art and design \( scad \) after a great weekend at accepted students day , and knowing my family s financial situation , i figured the package would be enticing i can only say that i was more than let down i looked over the package , and not only did i have loans , the package didn t even cover all of my tuition if i may speak candidly for a few moments , i really do not understand how parents in a household of eight are expected to pay close to 10 , 000 i know most people have to pay more than that , but my family isn t most families i have been put in a situation where i have to choose between the place i love and the place that gave me more money this feeling is dreadful being so close to going to your dream school , only to have the decision hang in the balance because of money is not something i imagined i would feel yes , i applied for outside scholarships , but so far none of them have come through i always figured that my situation would get me enough needbased financial aid , but i suppose there are more people out there with similar problems so far seton hall has offered me the most generous package unfortunately , i have never been there to visit , and probably never will get the chance they too had loans , but i had no outofpocket costs then there is always georgia state , which is basically free with the hope scholarship if you can t tell already , i m pretty disappointed and stressed rotc is still an option , but unfortunately i will have to find the extra money up front and then i will get repaid afterward so what do i do \? do i try and find the needed money \? do i accept another offer \? i had always hoped that i wouldn t have to base my decision on money , but it seems that s exactly what i will have to do
there was a great deal to be troubled by in a report by the international committee of the red cross documenting the kinds of torture and abuse inflicted on terrorism suspects by the central intelligence agency one disturbing footnote is that medical personnel were deeply involved in facilitating the abuses , which were intended to coerce suspects into providing intelligence the report , prepared in 2007 but kept secret until it was published by the new york review of books , was based on red cross interviews in late 2006 with 14 highvalue detainees , who include some of the most dangerous terrorists in custody the prisoners' complaints gain credibility because they described similar abuses and had been kept in isolation at different locations , with no chance to concoct a common story various prisoners said they had been subjected to waterboarding , forced to stand for days with their arms shackled overhead , confined in small boxes , beaten and kicked , slammed repeatedly into walls , prevented from sleeping , deprived of solid food , forced to remain naked for weeks or months at a stretch , often in frigid cells and immersed in cold water all were kept in continuous solitary confinement for their cia detention , ranging from 16 months to more than four years medical personnel seem to have been involved mostly as facilitators rather than torturers or interrogators in one case , they monitored a detainee s oxygen saturation with a device attached to his finger so waterboarding could be stopped before the prisoner suffocated in another case , an amputee forced to stand with his arms shackled overhead had his intact leg checked daily for signs of dangerous swelling several detainees said health workers sometimes instructed interrogators to continue , adjust or stop particular methods of abuse such activities violate the ethical codes of major health organizations , both national and international the red cross called it a gross breach of medical ethics that in some cases amounted to participation in torture and or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment none of the health personnel wore identification , but the prisoners inferred that they were physicians or psychologists they also could have been paramedics , physician s assistants or other lesstrained personnel the report underscores the need to have a fullscale investigation into these abusive practices and into who precisely participated in them only then will we know whether indictments or , in the case of physicians , the loss of medical licenses , are warranted
washington as the house moved toward climactic votes on legislation to remake the health care system , the said monday that middleincome families might be required to pay 15 percent to 18 percent of their income on insurance premiums and copayments under the proposal democrats cited the figures as evidence that the legislation would reduce premiums for many low and middleincome families who currently lack affordable coverage democratic leaders were drawing up ground rules for house floor debate on their bill , expected to begin late this week the bill would cover 36 million people at a cost of 105 trillion over 10 years , according to the budget office house republicans were drafting an alternative , which they said would be much less costly they acknowledged that it would cover fewer people representative john a boehner of ohio , the house minority leader , said the republican alternative would allow people to buy across state lines , encourage small businesses to band together to buy insurance at lower prices , and rein in lawsuits mr boehner said the republican proposal had none of the taxes or mandates of the democrats' bill and would not prohibit insurers from denying anyone coverage because of preexisting medical conditions but , he said , the republicans would provide more money to states to form highrisk pools , which offer coverage to people who cannot obtain private insurance republicans will have only a limited opportunity to influence the democrats' bill on the house floor under the rules for debate , republicans will probably not be able to propose amendments other than a complete substitute for the bill , democrats said those rules are sure to anger republicans , who have been clamoring for a chance to propose changes but they may also stymie some democrats who had wanted to propose amendments dealing , for example , with restrictions on  the house democrats' bill would offer 600 billion in subsidies to help low and middleincome people buy insurance , most of it from private insurance companies , according to the congressional budget office the subsidies would be available to people who obtain coverage through a new regulated market known as a health insurance exchange , scheduled to start operation in 2013 subsidies are based on the amounts charged for lowcost basic plans under the house bill , the budget office said , a family of four with income of 78 , 000 in 2016 would pay , on average , an annual premium of 8 , 800 and copayments of 5 , 000 , for a total of 13 , 800 , equivalent to 18 percent of the family s income a family of four with income of 90 , 100 could also receive subsidies it would pay 11 , 100 in premiums and 5 , 500 in costsharing , for a total of 16 , 600 , or 18 percent of family income , the budget office said for lowerincome people , the subsidies would be more generous a family of four with income of 66 , 000 would pay premiums of 6 , 300 and costsharing of 3 , 700 , for a total of 10 , 000 , or 15 percent of its income in 2016 , the budget office said the budget office did not say how insurance costs under the bill compared with the costs if congress did nothing the agency has previously estimated that premiums alone for families buying coverage on their own would average 11 , 000 in 2016 and that coverage is somewhat less extensive than what would be required by the house bill in its report on monday , the budget office noted that the house bill would spend more on subsidies than a bill approved by the senate finance committee for people receiving subsidies under the house bill , it said , the average subsidy would be 5 , 800 , or 1 , 000 more than the average under the senate finance bill the house bill , the report said , offers greater subsidies for cost sharing , which would be more valuable to people with health problems and thus would tend to attract a less healthy mix of enrollees moreover , the budget office said , the house bill restricts more sharply the extent to which premiums can vary by age this , it said , would make the insurance exchanges less attractive to younger people \( who tend to have lower health care costs \) and more attractive to older people \( who tend to have higher health care costs \) consumers union , the publisher of consumer reports , endorsed the house bill on monday , and democrats cited that as evidence of growing support for the measure health care is a consumer crisis , said james a guest , president of consumers union by creating a more secure , affordable health care system , the house bill goes a long way toward solving the crisis representative mike pence of indiana , the no 3 republican in the house , said the democrats' goal was to achieve universal coverage by contrast , he said republicans believe the real issue here is cost when i'm back home in indiana , people are not stopping me on the street clamoring for universal coverage republicans are particularly opposed to a provision of the house bill that would create a , to compete with private insurers the congressional budget office said the public plan would attract six million people but mr boehner said it could lead to a much bigger federal role what the left wants to do is to have a singlepayer national health care plan , mr boehner said while the government option is n't exactly that today , all the infrastructure that is being built into the government under this bill is intended to get ready for that
senator john ensign s parents gave almost 100 , 000 to his former lover and her family in april 2008 , it was revealed on thursday , as mr ensign s embarrassment over his extramarital affair seemed to deepen in april 2008 , senator john ensign s parents each made gifts to doug hampton , cindy hampton , and two of their children in the form of a check totaling 96 , 000 , a statement on the senator s behalf said each gift was limited to 12 , 000 the payments were made as gifts , accepted as gifts and complied with tax rules governing gifts last month , the republican senator from nevada held a brief news conference in las vegas to announce that he had an affair with a campaign staff member \( later identified as cynthia hampton \) , but had ended the relationship in addition , his office confirmed that mr hampton had recently demanded money and had threatened to go public with the affair just before the senator s admission but the involvement by the senator s parents was first revealed earlier today , as other details between mr hampton , who also had worked for the senator in his office , and mr ensign and other colleagues have spilled out in recent days after the senator told his parents about the affair , his parents decided to make the gifts out of concern for the wellbeing of longtime family friends during a difficult time , said the statement , first reported by t he las vegas sun on its web site  the gifts are consistent with a pattern of generosity by the ensign family to the hamptons and others none of the gifts came from campaign or official funds nor were they related to any campaign or official duties senator ensign has complied with all applicable laws and senate ethics rules on capitol hill , mr ensign told a reporter for the sun that he had no intention of resigning \( he quit his leadership post in the senate after initially disclosing the affair \) ensign said today he has no plans to resign and intends to continue his work despite ongoing questions about his affair i said before , i always planned on serving and working hard working harder than i ever worked and i m going to continue to do that , the senator said citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington , a watchdog group , is demanding that the justice department began an inquiry into whether mr ensign paid ms hampton additional money
baltimore cc sabathia worked 1 , 659 1 3 innings in his career before joining the yankees in none of those innings did he throw two wild pitches but he did it in his first inning as a yankee , here at camden yards against the orioles a bad omen or a meaningless bit of trivia \? we ll have plenty of time to find out but it should be noted sabathia escaped the first inning without allowing a run quick observation after an inning and a half this is a very different atmosphere than previous yankeesorioles game at camden yards , because most of the fans are rooting for the orioles
port st lucie , fla choosing the ' fifth starter will take all spring , said the other day but if tim redding overtakes the field the way he thinks he will , manuel will be delighted or if liv n hern ndez seizes control , that will be fine and dandy with the mets same goes if freddy garc a rediscovers his form so far , none of the above has transpired the three leading candidates in that no 5 starter derby pitched sunday , and all three failed to distinguish themselves again the hardest hit was redding , who was making his spring debut after being slowed by shoulder discomfort redding allowed five hits and five runs , including backtoback homers , before being pulled with one out in the third inning of the mets' 187 victory against the university of michigan preceding him was garc a , whose basic pitching line two innings , three hits , one strikeout concealed two hit batters and a lack of velocity before flulike symptoms left him homebound sunday , manuel seemed to have the right idea when he planned to go 70 miles north to watch hern ndez in a splitsquad game against the washington nationals working the first three innings of an 83 loss , hern ndez gave up one run on four hits and did not walk a batter , but he pitched in and out of trouble throughout luckily for them , the mets are not forming their impressions and making decisions based strictly on the weekend s performances if they were , pedro mart nez , impressive in tossing three scoreless innings for the dominican republic on saturday , might already have a contract in hand the mets understand the mitigating factors particularly for redding , who is still getting in shape but they made a concerted effort in the offseason to stockpile pitching depth and would be more encouraged if those signings were producing the biggest key for me was just going out there , feeling the ball come out of my hand , feeling no pain in the shoulder , said redding , who will next pitch thursday against florida as i 've heard probably a dozen times already , it s the first outing , who cares \? certainly not many of his teammates , who are scattered around various world baseball classic sites and , on sunday , a splitsquad game in viera left to play michigan were luis castillo , brian schneider , several reservetypes marlon anderson , cory sullivan , bobby kielty and a bunch of minor leaguers imported from across the complex when the publicaddress announcer said , here are your 2009 new york mets , as the players ran onto the field , a few fans laughed when we came here last year , i think we were starstruck by seeing david wright and jos reyes and carlos delgado , michigan first baseman mike dufek , who hit two home runs , including a tworun blast against redding that landed on the rightfield berm , said before the game with them not being here because of the classic , i'm not saying we 're not in awe , but it definitely feels different to hear redding tell it , michigan is accustomed to facing pitchers like him , someone who throws the standard four pitches and whose fastball grazes the low 90s the ability to put those pitches precisely where he wants them is what separates him from , say , the saturday starter for penn state on sunday , redding put pitches precisely where the michigan hitters wanted , hanging sliders and grooving fastballs his final pitch , a curveball , stayed over the plate , and nick urban clobbered it over the leftfield fence i'm upset that i did n't execute the pitches that i wanted to , but i did n't walk anybody , i did n't hit anybody , redding said i had a couple threeball counts , but when i needed to throw a strike , i did there s positives to build on that was an upbeat assessment , not a jab at garc a , who hit two of his first seven batters , including tim kalczynski with an 02 curveball once viewed as the frontrunner for the no 5 spot , garc a has been slow to recover from shoulder problems after appearing stiff in early bullpen sessions , garc a , 19 months removed from labrum surgery , was pummeled by the st louis cardinals for four runs in two innings in his last start he has a 2025 earned run average this spring he has yet to demonstrate the fastball velocity to complement his sharper offspeed pitches it topped out at 86 miles an hour , which was about what it was when he pitched for detroit last season we 've got a lot of time , garc a said one month left is plenty of time and for that , the mets are thankful inside pitch mike pelfrey \( muscle strain in lower left leg \) will not make his scheduled start monday against baltimore he said he was hoping to throw a bullpen session wednesday and to rejoin the rotation by the weekend brandon knight will start for pelfrey ngel pag n , out since friday with a sore right elbow , flew to new york to have tests and be examined by team doctors
indianapolis as the world series champions , the are the object of envy at the winter meetings yet as executives and agents huddled in hotel suites monday , safe from the snow outside , the yankees were just like the rest of baseball they want arms pitching , pitching , pitching , and then left field , general manager said those are the obvious areas we need to focus on the yankees have an advantage on other teams , of course , because they have the highest payroll they hope to bring it below 200 million for next season , but that still gives them enough space to have choices their first move was to subtract a pitcher , trading reliever brian bruney to the washington nationals on monday for a player to be named the nationals pick first in the rule 5 draft on thursday , and they will select a player for the yankees the last player the yankees kept from the rule 5 draft was josh phelps in 2007 , but other teams have uncovered stars players like johan santana \( 1999 \) and josh hamilton \( 2006 \) have been acquired in that draft bruney was eligible for salary arbitration , and cashman said the yankees have strong bullpen alternatives they have fewer reliable options in the rotation , so their first priority is to resign , who has told the yankees he will return for the right deal at this time last year , the yankees offered pettitte 10 million , which he rejected negotiations dragged until late january , when pettitte signed for a 55 million guarantee after a strong season in which he earned 5 million more in incentives , pettitte s offer is higher than 10 million this time but cashman was not sure the sides could strike a deal quickly nothing ever seems to go smooth , cashman said , speaking generally that s the nature of the beast when you 're negotiating salary and trying to determine what s fair at least with pettitte , there is a long track record on which to base a salary with the cuban lefthander aroldis chapman , there is almost none chapman and pettitte are both represented by randy and alan hendricks , so it is logical that the sides have discussed chapman , too the yankees are , but not for a price like the 151 million the nationals paid pitcher stephen strasburg , the no 1 pick in last june s draft chapman , 21 , throws 100 miles an hour but has not worked out for teams other pitchers who interest the yankees include roy halladay , who has a year left on his deal with toronto , and the free agents , and cashman flew to indianapolis on a private jet with the agents sam and seth levinson , who represent jason marquis , for colorado last season but has never pitched in the american league he s very successful , pitched in tough markets , and he s a new yorker , cashman said that means he s tough the yankees have not committed to bringing back chienming wang , their no 2 starter last april who struggled and then had shoulder surgery in july wang s agent , alan nero , said the yankees had not told him if they would tender wang a contract before the deadline saturday nero said he was optimistic that wang could be ready by opening day , but cashman put the timetable between april and june if the yankees tender a contract to wang , they will be bound to pay him at least 4 million he works very hard , and he s extremely structured , cashman said but at the same time , shoulders are tricky , too those are things we 'll have to determine i 'll talk to our doctors and get the most uptodate medical information prior to our decision once the yankees strengthen their rotation , they will focus on johnny damon or other left fielders the future of designated hitter hideki matsui will follow that , though there are no indications the yankees have decided they want to retain him in dealing bruney , the yankees parted with a hardthrowing reliever who had worked in 153 games for them since 2006 bruney dealt with elbow issues last season and lost his job as the setup man , but he made the world series roster and pitched once nationals general manager mike rizzo , who drafted bruney for arizona , told him he could be a lateinning reliever for washington , which had the worst record in the majors in 2009 this is going to be a little different , but i think it s going to be a pretty good opportunity for me , bruney said by telephone from texas , where he was on a hunting trip with brett gardner i'm definitely going to miss new york , but it s a lot easier to go out when you win a world series
bergenbelsen , germany habbo knoch , who runs the new bergenbelsen memorial at the former concentration camp , invited various scholars and museum directors to a fourday conference here last week called witnessing sites of destruction and the representation of the holocaust he asked a question one evening during a break will people in 20 years look back and say we built a museum that focuses on nazi genocide while darfur was happening \? will they ask whether anyone raised this issue \? consider it raised the new memorial is an immense concrete and glass museum emerging from a copse of trees beside the cemetery of mass graves \( there are more than 70 , 000 bodies buried there \) , which had been the camp site the permanent exhibition is a model of its kind , focused on the meticulous and sober reconstruction of the past from time to time the present literally intrudes with a bang , though , when practice rounds of tank fire from the british military base next door boom over the treetops otherwise you might be struck by how ordinary the whole area seems during the war , prisoners at first soviet soldiers , later jews used to be marched several miles from a railway terminal beyond the base , which was then for the wehrmacht , and past fields , farms and houses some survivors have said they were struck by the pretty scenery at the camp , corpses lay in piles and thousands were dying of starvation and disease , from genocide by neglect the farmers and villagers who had watched the prisoners go by afterward mostly claimed they knew nothing about it times change some of the children of those farmers and villagers recall on videotaped interviews the endless lines of walking dead it was impossible not to see what was plainly in front of them along these lines , the constant television broadcasts during the conference of grieving parents and wounded children in gaza reminded a few conferees of the emotions stirred up by video testimonies of holocaust survivors \( there are dozens of these in the museum \) , and the comparison made several scholars uneasy videos are only one form of evidence , a french researcher ventured , inadequate by themselves as history true that said , the holocaust has become what one expert here called the master narrative for suffering , shaping discussions about every present conflict over genocide and human rights even as comparisons distort history and can serve the purposes of propaganda as often as the truth every generation gets the stories it wants to hear , is how heidemarie uhl , an austrian scholar , put it , which is to say that the master narrative of the shoah itself has evolved to suit different eras she pointed out that the memorial at the former mauthausen concentration camp in northern austria was for several years after the war controlled by the soviets , who put up a monument to communist resistance but none to the jews today the message at mauthausen has come to reflect austria s negative memory , ms uhl said , referring to the collective sentiment of austrians \( many of them , she might have added , but alas , still not enough \) who admit their country willingly committed genocide as at bergenbelsen , the permanent exhibition there now speaks to a kind of postideological , postcoldwar world that prizes victimhood and individual resilience , just as the communist memorial spoke to soviet priorities history keeps moving , in other words here at bergenbelsen , after liberation in april 1945 , the military training barracks became a camp for displaced persons jews awaited transport to america , australia and to the new israel , a flashpoint with british authorities who also controlled some jewish survivors inaugurated a theater company called kazet \( the name played on the german kz , for concentration camp \) life started over in other ways , too henri lustigerthaler , who helped organize the conference , recalled that his mother , a former prisoner , returned from paris to give birth at the camp hospital because her friends were here then bergenbelsen fell into neglect ronald reagan was responsible \( inadvertently \) for its revival the announcement that he would visit nazi graves at bitburg in 1985 resulted in an uproar that forced his staff to scramble , and bergenbelsen was suddenly added to his itinerary embarrassed germans , who preferred to forget the site , threw together a small documentation center it soon became inadequate to the accumulating archives , to the general liberalizing process of german identity building after the wall fell , and to the growing public appetite abroad for holocaust museums , along with the tourist economy they generated nothing about the present museum dramatizes information for visitors the way , say , the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington apparently feels it needs to divorced as it is from the sites of persecution , it turns relics of genocide like a zyklon b canister and a cattle car that transported jews to auschwitz into props bergenbelsen has the camp as evidence , or what s left of it after liberation , the british burned down the prisoners' barracks to stem the spread of typhus , and hired an architect to turn bulldozed graves into a pastoral cemetery the architect turned out to be a favorite of the nazis , adding insult to injury , but by the time that scandal broke it was already too late , and the graves today look like teutonic mounds , covered in lavender in the absence of original buildings , the aura of bergenbelsen now , as at all haunted places , can be linked to the superstition people tend to bring to it the vague hope that our presence might somehow help renew the ground meanwhile the sheer emptiness of the landscape , never mind the graves , speaks clearly to loss of course , there are still the photographs and films made by arriving british troops to show what once was here various camps liberated before bergenbelsen had been evacuated or destroyed , but the germans turned this place over as it had been circulated worldwide in newspapers , magazines and movie theaters , the pictures made unconditional surrender obligatory and the site forever synonymous with the worst nazi atrocities in a sense , the images have become too familiar , too loaded the museum stresses the survivor testimonies instead these run silently on monitors throughout the galleries , accompanied by subtitles in german and english as geoffrey hartman , the literary scholar who helped start the fortunoff video archive for holocaust testimonies at yale , remarked after walking through the museum , the quiet promotes a space in which to think that thinking is important but you can also wear headphones to hear the voices mr hartman borrowed paul celan s famous phrase about bottles in the ocean tossed at the shoreline of a heart to describe the effect one survivor is robert rijxman i was sitting on a rock , he recalls on screen it was sunny , in winter i just prayed to die , but it did n't work without sound , he s the picture of defiance , elfin and smiling , clutching a pipe like an old swiss mountaineer after a walk in the alps but listening to him , you hear that he needs a moment to collect himself and it suddenly becomes clear that mr rijxman wishes to convey a thought darker and more complicated than simple defiance praying for death did n't work , is what he said not to this day , he added another reminder of history s relentlessness
the ' season is like a haunted house , with the team staggering along from room to room , encountering one little nightmare after another on sunday night , it was the indignity of on national television by none other than , who not only shut out his former teammates for eight innings but also threw 130 pitches , the most he had thrown in a game in eight years now comes wednesday night , when the mets play the first of their final 17 games of the season it was exactly at that point , of course , that the collapses of 2007 and 2008 began in 2007 , the mets lost 12 of those 17 a sevengame lead over philadelphia in the national league east melted away , with the mets on the final day of the season in 2008 , the mets lost 10 of the final 17 games a twoandahalf game lead over the went first , followed by a lead in the wildcard race on the final day of the season , the mets were  martinez s performance on sunday was a rebuke to the mets , a vivid reminder that they for this season wednesday s game , in atlanta , will allow everyone and anyone to bring up the 2007 and 2008 collapses all over again when residing in a haunted house , as the mets do , there is always something to send you reeling
\( brian burke , a former navy pilot who has taken up the less dangerous hobby of nfl statistical analysis , operates , a blog about football , math and human behavior his it s week 13 and the playoff picture is coming into focus one of the interesting applications for a game probability model is to forecast the outcome of the entire season , and estimate the likelihood each team will make the playoffs based on the probabilities for each remaining game in the schedule , we can simulate the season to estimate each team s playoff chances , we can play out the season thousands of times and tally how often each team finishes with a playoff berth we can even estimate which seeds each team is most likely to earn the nfl s tiebreaking and seeding rules are notoriously complex , so projecting playoff teams is harder than it sounds that s why i turn to chris cox , whose site nflforecastcom does a great job of figuring out all the crazy playoff scenarios chris uses my game probabilities as the basis for the season projections , and even offers a small web application to customize your own forecasts based on current projections , the jets have a very small \( 3 percent \) chance of making the playoffs they are essentially locked in a battle with the dolphins for second place in the afc east , and are on the outside looking in at a wild card the broncos , steelers , ravens and jaguars are currently the teams most likely to earn wildcard slots the giants outlook is a lot brighter , with about an overall 52 percent chance of making the playoffs with games against the cowboys and the eagles remaining , they still have a 20 percent chance of retaking the division giants fans need to keep a close eye on the packers and the eagles , their only real competition for the wild card at the moment if these chances seem too pessimistic to you , keep in mind that the message from all directions is to keep fans optimistic and involved the league , the teams and the television networks all want fan interest to last as long as possible into the season none of them are going to start to advertise when fans should give up there s also our natural inclination for hope , which can be a powerful thing with that , here are this week s game probabilities \( editor s note brian is too modest to say so , but his model went 151 last week the one miss was ravenssteelers \( ravens won in overtime \) , and the decision to sit roethlisberger might have tipped the balance on that one \) brian explained how his predictions work in this post
east rutherford , nj it is hard to imagine a coach benching a pro bowl kicker for a playoff game , but it could happen , at least in part , when s reigning champion host the on sunday john carney , 44 , an emergency replacement this season for lawrence tynes , has been more efficient on field goals and extra points than on his kickoffs , which rarely reach the end zone the national football conference divisional game will be played in the cold and swirling wind of giants stadium , making kickoffs even more difficult might coughlin use carney only for field goals and extra points while using tynes last season s kicker for kickoffs \? i'm considering everything that i possibly can consider , coughlin said wednesday carney was more candid about the possibility that s certainly logical , carney said that s obviously not a decision that lawrence or myself get to make , but that s what we did when we played philadelphia last time and i thought we were successful with that combination actually , it happened the first time the teams played each other , a 3631 giants victory at philadelphia on nov 9 , and not the last time they played , on dec 7 , when the eagles won , 2014 , at giants stadium at philadelphia , carney and tynes were among the 45 giants in uniform , the only game the giants dressed two placekickers , a rarity in the nfl that night , carney made all three fieldgoal attempts and all three extra points , and tynes kicked off eight times the only other game tynes played was the next week , at home against baltimore , when carney was idle tynes that day made his only fieldgoal attempt , was perfect on three extrapoint attempts and kicked off six times the kicking matter was but one issue discussed wednesday as the topseeded giants had their first practice after having a bye the wildcard eagles , seeded sixth , defeated minnesota , 2614 , last sunday meanwhile , brandon jacobs , who missed the final game of the regular season with a left knee injury , practiced and vowed to play i can go out and run full speed and i can make harder cuts , jacobs said i'm ready to go i feel real good justin tuck , the defensive end , did not practice because of his injured lower right leg , but he should be ready to play sunday fred robbins , the defensive tackle who missed the last game of the regular season with a shoulder injury , practiced the only other giant not to work was linebacker zak deossie , who also makes long snaps for punts he had a sore back the backup lineman grey ruegamer snapped for punting practice in his place should deossie not dress for the game , that could clear a spot for a second kicker compared with the regulars on offense and defense , placekickers play relatively bit parts , but sometimes they are crucial carney joined the team after tynes injured his left knee , on his planting leg , in the preseason on extra points , carney was 38 of 38 and was 35 of 38 on fieldgoal attempts two fieldgoal tries were blocked his only miss not blocked was in the season s final game , a 2019 defeat in minnesota , a 48yard try that went wide to the right but of carney s five kickoffs that day , none reached the end zone under ideal conditions in a domed stadium his season s average of 604 yards per kickoff ranked 36th in the nfl \( the leader was josh brown of st louis at 681 \) the return average against carney , 218 yards , was 30th in the league , which was good but because kickers boot balls from their 30yard line , carney s averages meant that opponents started their drives , on average , just past their 32yard line carney managed only three touchbacks in 79 kickoffs tynes had one in 14 kickoffs and had an average distance of 64 yards in his two games we work well together , carney said we 've learned a lot from each other i totally understand his frustration and i totally agree with it it s a strange situation and a bizarre situation
the closed its 50thanniversary season at city center on sunday night with a program of the season s highlights it ended , of course , with revelations , topped off with an encore of its rocka my soul finale after this encore the artistic director , , and the associate artistic director , masazumi chaya , joined the dancers onstage but did not stay and that was perfect ms jamison , surely the most stellar and admired artistic director of any repertory dance company in america , made several marvelous appearances onstage at the start of the season , but she knows just when to give the applause back to the dancers , and never more than on the closing night of a long run the popularity that the ailey company now enjoys is phenomenal city center does better business at most performances for these five weeks of ailey than for american ballet theater or san francisco ballet in their twoweek seasons or the kirov in its threeweek one no work in ailey s repertory seems to occur without warm audience cheers in between these annual new york seasons the troupe has a tour schedule that almost every other dance company must envy i am only surprised that there are still two states \( south dakota , west virginia \) in which it has yet to appear it s worth noting that the word american in the ailey company s name has a significance quite different from that , say , in american ballet theater a ballet theater season tries to be a kind of ballet national gallery , combining some of the best international classics with some of the foremost national choreography but the america we see in the ailey repertory is a yes we can vision , and it has a great deal to do with aspects of transcendence some of the dances , though specific to africanamerican heritage and music \( the blues of blues suite , the gospel of revelations \) , proclaim these things as glories to be shared the casting has layers of transcendence too you ca n't miss this when the curtain rises on the opening of revelations as the dancers stand there for i been 'buked , you see a marked variety of skin tones and ethnic types dances to gospel music are n't just for africanamericans here are white and hispanic dancers too \( this layer of the ailey experience never seems to go too far , admittedly the featured roles in blues suite or revelations seem chiefly reserved for africanamericans , perhaps because some of the nonafricanamerican dancers tend not to be the company s best \) alas , a large part of the ailey experience has also to do with watching the dancers transcend choreography that is at best minor i assume this goes back to ailey himself none of the work i have seen by him and plenty was revived this season is dross , but only revelations is a gold mine his other works tend to be largespirited but overreliant on a limited vocabulary \( albeit rich toned \) , deploying a fair level of basic theatrical skill and choreographic craftsmanship and using a wide selection of excellent music their largeness of spirit , though seldom joined by any special subtlety of expression , releases in the dancers the generous , expansive communicativeness that is a constant ailey characteristic all these dancers too have qualities of focus from which performers across the world could learn to watch them addressing different points of the compass during rocka my soul is always a thrill amos j machanic jr has in addition a kind of childlike absorption in his dances that makes them fly straight to my heart linda celeste sims and glenn allen sims , though occasionally losing freshness , have unfailing glamour and authority and jamar roberts and antonio douthit also gave more and more cause for pleasure as the season advanced in the current repertory s golden section is the only firstrate work other than revelations , and the ailey dancers are n't giving it the throughthebody dance value they could elsewhere the ailey experience has n't much to do with choreography it does have plenty to do with good music the final performance was a reminder of how much superb recorded music the ailey repertory employs the voice we hear in blues suite is that of brother john sellers in the words and the tears rolled down my cheeks you hear the tears pouring through his voice , and no other aspect of the work hits so hard the title suite otis tells you you 'll hear otis redding , and though george faison s 1971 choreography is perfectly professional and appealing , the only special ingredient is redding s music mauro bigonzetti s festa barocca has two special ingredients its handel music especially in andreas scholl s astounding singing of dove sei , amato bene \?

major league baseball faces two fundamental problems weather and umpire accountability the weather is just part of the game , but umpiring has become an increasingly disturbing part of the game on thursday the and the cut short their workouts at yankee stadium because of biting rain and falling temperatures the teams were able get in their american league championship series opener friday night , a 41 win for the yankees , but there was still the threat that game 2 on saturday could very well be washed out welcome to winter ball in the fall , a result of too many days off in the postseason and the power of the networks , which have devised a schedule that will have major leaguers playing baseball in november but baseball s larger problem is the umpires their performance may be the same as it has always been , but the scrutiny is much greater the playoffs have been full of highprofile blunders , and there are bad calls day in , day out during the regular season gamechanging calls that , out of a sense of tradition and maintaining the flow of play , cannot be reviewed or corrected baseball instituted instant review of home run calls last year , but it needs to go further managers should have the opportunity to challenge one call per game for plays on the basepaths yankees manager joe girardi said he was open to having one challenge but did n't like the idea of throwing a flag on the ground to contest a call , as nfl coaches do , because it would interrupt the flow of the game what happened if you were able to press a button and you had another umpire upstairs and they looked at it right away and they could get it right in 30 seconds \? girardi said at a news conference thursday i would not have a problem with that the bottom line is , you want things to be right in the game do n't look for any steps forward anytime soon , though baseball moves slowly and seems in a perpetual state of denial but the umpires need help nearly every fan has a horror story about how his team was victimized by an umpire s call i know there have been some things that happened , but those things have been happening for 130 years , commissioner bud selig said in a telephone interview but 130 years ago there was no technology to overturn a bad call and allow justice to prevail last year major league baseball finally began limited use of instant replay to help ensure that home run calls and nothing else were correct fair balls that did n't clear the fence but were called foul , runners who were safe but were called out none of this is reviewable i'm concerned about the pace of the game , selig said , repeating a popular refrain my thoughts on adding instant replay are what they were a year ago i do n't want to increase it in any way , shape , form or matter there is an inherent accountability gap between players and managers on one hand and umpires on the other when the st louis cardinals' matt holliday with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning in game 2 of their national league division series against the los angeles dodgers , there were swift consequences the cardinals lost the game , and holliday had to face the news media to talk about his gaffe boston closer jonathan papelbon made a mistake with a pitch against the angels' vladimir guerrero in game 3 of their american league division series , and guerrero that eliminated the red sox papelbon was held accountable , too but when the umpire phil cuzzi made a blunder in the twinsyankees series , and potentially costing minnesota game 2 , the crew chief apologized , and that was it there was no redress for the twins in game 3 of the nl division series between colorado and philadelphia , with the score at 55 in the top of the ninth and a runner at second , the phillies' chase utley hit in front of home plate and was called safe at first , with jimmy rollins advancing to third from there he scored the goahead run on a fly ball philadelphia won the game , 65 , and took a 21 lead in the series but a replay showed that utley s hit was actually a foul ball , because it hit him in the batter s box the plate umpire admitted as much after the game that s not good enough no one is calling for umpires to wear their names on their backs or give postgame news conferences that s not the accountability needed but playoff games should not be decided by gaffes , and giving managers one challenge per game on plays on the basepaths is a partial remedy and a step in the right direction i do n't think you could do it with ball and strikes , but i think you can do it with some calls , girardi said if you can do it quickly , i 'd be all for it players and managers work yearround , and fans sit in the baking sun and endure freezing cold to watch baseball all they ask umpires is to make sure the hard work is n't negated the technology is available get it right
throughout the fall , lawmakers in the house have been drafting and reworking legislation to reform the financial system senate democrats weighed in last week with a plan that is stronger than the house bills on aspects of derivatives regulation and consumer protection it also invites healthy debate on other issues , like the role of the federal reserve in a reformed system but the proposal , created by senator christopher dodd , the chairman of the banking committee , is just a draft senators will have to stand up to pressure from banking and business lobbies , which surely will try to weaken the beneficial parts of the plan as it makes its way through the legislative process on that score , the experience in the house has not been encouraging some major issues an overarching goal of reform is to ensure that derivatives are traded on public exchanges rather than as opaque and risky private bilateral contracts proposals in the house and by the obama administration undercut that goal by exempting derivatives from exchange trading for corporations that use them to hedge risks , like a utility that wants to hedge against swings in energy prices the dodd plan would correctly leave it up to the regulator to rule on any such exemptions still , it does not attack all loopholes as in house and administration proposals , it excludes from oversight a type of derivative known as a foreignexchange swap that is dangerous because it could enable various types of derivatives say those used to hedge against interest rate spikes to be structured to avoid regulation like the house and the administration , mr dodd calls for a consumer financial protection agency to ensure that financial products sold to the public are in a consumer s best interest unlike the house version of the new agency , mr dodd would always allow states to impose tougher consumer protection regulations , in addition to federal rules also in contrast to the house , the dodd plan does not have carveouts for auto dealers who offer credit , or for other special interests the house and administration would distribute supervisory powers among the federal reserve , the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the comptroller of the currency mr dodd calls for the creation of one main federal regulator , reasoning that a single regulator would end regulator shopping whereby banks choose their own overseer , invariably opting for the weakest one but that still ignores the problem of regulatory capture whereby regulators come to be controlled by the entities they regulate with only one primary federal regulator , the risk of capture is heightened , because there would be no parallel regulatory regimes by which to judge the relative strength or weakness of the single regulator a better approach may be to retain multiple regulators , but restrict the easy ability of banks to pick and choose among them congress must also do a better job of overseeing the regulators , a duty it largely abdicated in the years before the crisis the house and the administration propose new bank regulatory powers for the fed but they have not called for the changes needed in the clubby and secretive fed system for the central bank to exercise its new powers in an unbiased and transparent way the dodd plan pulls in the opposite direction it would strip the fed of regulatory powers , even though fed supporters say that such powers are central to the fed s ability to make informed decisions about the economy none of the proposals have yet to strike a workable balance , but mr dodd is right not to blindly accept the notion that the fed has the expertise and willingness to regulate , when such expertise and willingness were manifestly absent in the runup to the crisis like other reform proposals in congress , the dodd plan imposes costs like higher capital requirements on large and interconnected firms the aim is to make size and complexity so costly that firms opt to be smaller the plan stops short , however , of creating a failsafe mechanism to break up toobigtofail firms before they fail if incentives to downsize do n't work the dodd plan is also in line with other proposals in calling for resolution authority the power for regulators to seize and restructure large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms when imminent failure poses a systemwide threat but unless the final legislation is very tightly written , resolution authority could be misconstrued as bailout authority the ability of regulators to use taxpayer money to keep failing firms alive some regulators and administration officials may prefer that flexibility but it is imperative that resolution authority rule out the possibility of such bailouts otherwise , it will be impossible to control risks in the system it is also important to grapple with the limits of resolution authority most large and interconnected firms are global , and thus would require an international resolution system to dismantle them in a crisis resolution authority for american regulators is a necessary step to confront the nation s outsize financial sector , but it is not a sufficient fix for the toobigtofail problem with the house moving forward and a senate plan on the table , opportunities exist for strong reform the other option , which sadly also exists , is that lawmakers will entrench the status quo under the guise of reform
kalkaska , mich in a dizzying matter of hours this week , the story of john barnes , a local man who said he thought he was abducted as a toddler from his real parents outside a long island grocery store in the 1950s , bubbled forth in this pinefilled michigan village of a few thousand people and raced onto a national television stage mr barnes , a quiet , polite , unemployed man whose wife works at a local grocery store , said he had long felt different from the people he was told were his parents and siblings he had been pondering his origins for years , and his internet research led him to the sister of a child kidnapped decades ago and miles away by wednesday , reporters from around the country swarmed this quiet village near traverse city known for snowmobiling and fishing on thursday morning , mr barnes told his story on nbc s today , along with his wouldbe sister and thursday night , federal authorities announced that dna tests had showed that mr barnes was not the boy who had been kidnapped , and people here concluded that mr barnes was , in all likelihood , just mr barnes of kalkaska after all by then , though , the story had captivated residents of kalkaska some hopeful that it was true , others smirking at it all along it also left a giant rift within the barnes family , who said they learned of their relative s puzzling claim only when reporters began appearing at their doors it s a mystery to me , lynn jenkins , a 76yearold potato farmer , said to his friends inside the trout town country cafe on thursday morning the group debated whether mr barnes s blond hair and bone structure matched the barnes family s looks , talked about what kind of dna testing might convince them either way , and pondered how , if the story were true , the barnes family would have ended up with a kidnapped child there have been many leads over the years in the case of steven damman , who was 2 years and 10 months old when he vanished on oct 31 , 1955 , from outside the long island grocery store as his mother shopped inside the boy s sister , pamela , a 7monthold baby , left in a carriage beside him , was not taken at the time , bloodhounds and 2 , 000 people searched for the boy , while sound trucks broadcast his description and people were told to search their vehicles' trunks false sightings and fake ransom notes came hundreds of people called in tips , none of which led to an answer as the years went by , the kidnapping rarely was discussed within the damman family but a few months ago , pamela damman horne , steven s sister , now in her 50s , received a handwritten letter and a clump of photographs from mr barnes , a stranger ms horne and mr barnes submitted to a private , preliminary dna test which , the authorities say , had not ruled out the possibility they were related and which led to the more sophisticated tests by the federal bureau of investigation on thursday , mr barnes told today about his longheld feelings about the barnes family i just knew i did n't come from these people , he said but at the home of dick barnes , 75 , who raised john barnes along with an older brother , richard jr , and a younger sister , cheryl , the claims seemed astounding and absurd cheryl barnes , 50 , found herself greeting reporters at her father s front porch and trying to prove that her brother was her brother this is all out of nowhere , she said he s always saying something , and now it s this \? is he saying our dad is a kidnapper \? in town , josh perttunen , the editor of the local newspaper , the leader and the kalkaskian , said he believed most locals had hoped the story would prove true i think we 've all had a moment in our lives where we did n't fit in , said mr perttunen , 27 by thursday s end , though , the answer had reached kalkaska and well beyond in newton , iowa , jerry damman , the father of the boy who vanished , sounded tired i have mixed feelings about this , said mr damman , 78 naturally , it s a disappointment in some ways
jason kapono does n't dunk that fact would be unremarkable were it not for his occupation and his height kapono plays for the philadelphia 76ers and is 6 feet 8 inches he is in his seventh season , but the only dunks he has thrown down in all that time have come during practice not all tall athletes are created equal kapono began the season with 1 , 182 field goals in his career , nary a jam among them in comparison , the athletic 67 rookie demar derozan notched his first dunk in just his second nba game with the toronto raptors in many ways , the slam dunk is the professional game s signature play , the equivalent of baseball s home run and football s touchdown dunks are looped on highlight reels every night and emulated by children with small hoops and big dreams every day i would love to feel that , i just have n't discovered any pill or substance to take that would help me out in that category , kapono joked in published by simon schuster this month , chris ballard devotes a chapter to the dunk and a passage to kapono s career without one but kapono is hardly alone in the nba every year , a handful of forwards and centers go the entire 82game season without dunking for reasons that range from to restrictive offenses to aging bodies to a basic inability to jump very high danny ferry , who is 610 and now the cleveland cavaliers' general manager , did not dunk in at least the final six years of his career , starting in 199798 , when the statistician harvey pollack started tracking such information the former knicks forward charles oakley , who is 68 , went three seasons without one last season , the clippers' 610 steve novak , new orleans s 67 morris peterson and san antonio s 610 fabricio oberto and 69 kurt thomas did not dunk , according to pollack the explanations vary injuries sidetracked half of peterson s season when healthy , peterson , a guard , is paired with the penetrating point guard chris paul and has the responsibility of being the first player to get back on defense oberto , 34 , and thomas , 37 , are traditional post players , but they are nearing the end of their careers meanwhile , kapono and novak are 3point specialists who seldom step into 2point territory on the offensive end kapono entered this season as the nba s career leader in 3point accuracy at 454 percent he is such an aficionado of the 3 that when he learned that his old jersey number , 24 , which he wore as a member of four other nba teams , was retired by the 76ers , he tripled it and now wears no 72 i do n't really get to the hoop , kapono said the only chance i get to dunk would be in a breakaway , and that is probably slim to none probably none so , i never really have a chance to the players who rarely dunk recalled their last slam , or attempt , as if it were a first kiss peterson went up for one last year , but he did not have the same lift off the floor after knee and ankle injuries oberto s last dunk came about a season and a half ago , after a spurs assistant coach bet him dinner that he could not do it in a slow practice last season with the raptors , kapono saw his opportunity he came around a pick with the defender a second slow , turned the corner and dunked the whole practice stopped , kapono said guys were falling down , like , oh my god , j k dunked ! ' the act itself was once discouraged the national collegiate athletic association banned dunking from 1968 to 1977 because kareem abduljabbar did it so often and easily dunking did not become accepted into the mainstream until julius erving revolutionized the art in the american basketball association , trailed by michael jordan in the nba the 65 oscar robertson , one of the game s greatest players and the only one to average a tripledouble for an entire season , never dunked in an nba game robertson s high school coach , ray crowe , discouraged dunking , but that was not robertson s only deterrent he once leapt for a dunk on an indiana playground and was knocked into a pole by a defender it is debatable to him whether the game would be better off without it i guess it s a thrill to some guys , robertson , 70 , said in a recent phone interview the way it is now , it is a way of showing dominance by dunking the ball and patting your chest and opening your mouth but in the end , can you make those jump shots , those 3point shots \? that s what it takes with age , it is natural for highfliers to orbit closer to ground level the best players reinvent their games kobe bryant and vince carter are former slamdunk champions and still considered elite athletes bryant had 59 dunks last season , 51st most in the league carter had the 67th most with 46 they learn to play different ways and they get smarter , orlando magic coach stan van gundy said some of those guys get even better as they get older even though they might not be dunking they still can when they need to they pick their spots better and they really learn the other parts of the game van gundy s roster spans the gamut of dunkers he has carter , a onetime leaper extraordinaire dwight howard , who led the league in dunks last season with 201 and jameer nelson , a point guard who can vividly recall his only nba dunk in six seasons my second season against new jersey in orlando , nelson said he has dunked , i think that was on nba live 2005 , howard said , referring to the video game in a game \? i heard he dunked in college , but we do n't have any proof of that , so i do n't think he can dunk anymore i 've seen him get up and grab the rim , but that s a little bit different howard can offer oneliners on the subject because he dunked for the first time in eighth grade he turned serious when asked how his game would change if he could not dunk it s just like if i did n't have shoes , i would n't know what it would feel like to have shoes , howard said so , i would never know what it s like not to dunk if i 've never done it before i 'd just have to use everything else , try to take away the stuff that people do who can dunk howard s imagery is a reality for players like kapono i see the game from the floor up instead of guys who see it from the floor down , kapono said my skill set is more fundamentals , shooting , footwork game i do n't really understand or ca n't fathom or feel the explosion , athleticism or speed of the game the topic is sensitive dunking , after all , signals masculinity after being asked about it , oberto dunked at a recent wizards shootaround , almost to prove he could that s a list i do n't want to be on , peterson said , adding he would try to dunk in that evening s game the opportunity did not come but he can still take solace in nelson s global retort for nondunkers across the world two points , he said , are two points
here we are at the big health care bill weekend ! the house of representatives is actually getting ready to vote on legislation how long has this been in the works , anyway \? was mad men on tv when the debate started \? had tv been invented \? on the eve of the big vote , leaders admitted that things could stretch into next week but no later than tuesday unless something else happens rome was n't built in a day anyhow , we concerned citizens need to decide exactly what we 're rooting for public option \? which one \? how much would you care if there were none at all \? for some people , a health care bill without a public option is like a car without an engine for others including some members of the obama administration it s more like a car without a hood ornament everything was thrown into an uproar by this week s elections , when people in virginia and new jersey voted down a deeply unpopular democratic governor and a deeply incompetent democratic wouldbe governor this has been interpreted as a sign that the muchbeloved independent voter thinks obama is not doing enough , and also too much congress is panicking ! this happens quite a bit , but right now they 're behaving like a herd of overly caffeinated cattle that missed the last train connection meanwhile , there s nothing but confidence and serenity among the rightwing teaparty types they cannot get over the triumph in upstate new york , where thanks to their really extraordinary efforts , a completely safe republican seat went to the democrats think how far their movement has come ! only a few months ago , they barely had the power to disrupt a town meeting and soon they will be able to destroy anything in their path , including their own party , like conservative locusts the teaparty folk were back in washington at the end of the week for a rally against the health care bill called by representative michele bachmann , washington s newest famous strange person their extreme enthusiasm and cheer was truly awesome representative todd akin of missouri led the rally in the pledge of allegiance noting that the part about one nation under god always drives the liberals crazy then he promptly forgot the rest of the words in most hyperpatriotic groups , the inability of a congressman to remember that this is one nation indivisible might be a downer but the crowd responded like a troop of pumpedup motivational speakers great job ! someone cried without the least trace of cynicism that was awesome , todd ! yelled someone else you cannot totally dislike a group with that kind of team spirit , so i hope those were not the exact same people carrying the sign that equated the health care bill with the holocaust there was something sort of touching , in an eerie , slightly disturbing way , when john ratzenberger the guy who once played the mailman on cheers told the crowd that the health care bill advocates were woodstock democrats like abbie hoffman and wavy gravy the crowd seemed on the old side , but is it really possible that any of them are still worrying about abbie hoffman \? that any of them knew who wavy gravy is \? was n't his main claim to fame giving out free granola \? is this a problem we need to deal with at the present moment \? but i digress , sort of if the health care vote happens this weekend , perhaps you will want to flip back and forth between the football games try to picture minority leader john boehner as an overage cheerleader with a strangecolored tan a while back , speaker nancy pelosi was promising that the house bill would have a robust public option that would have offered real competition to the insurance companies , thus driving costs down but then pelosi was faced with a minirebellion from red state democrats who were terrified by the news of republican victories in races having nothing whatsoever to do with barack obama , congress or health care , and she modified the plan now it s a nonrobust option , sort of like decaf instant coffee and even if it passes , the bill will go to the senate where everybody is embroiled in an argument over whether the public option should involve a trigger , as olympia snowe urges , or an optout , which majority leader harry reid is peddling , or be eliminated altogether so the red state democrats are pacified and joe lieberman does not go through with his threat to filibuster although lieberman is no longer a democrat and backed john mccain in the last election , his former party did let him hang around and keep his important committee chairmanship supporting an attempt to kill the democrats' most important piece of legislation through a parliamentary procedure would be a tad churlish but there we are the health care bill has a lot to recommend it anyway , but if you 're a public option fan , where do you draw the line \? personally , in these moments of crisis , i generally recommend looking to see where joe lieberman is going then head the other way
to the west , the mediterranean sparkled and winked to the east , columns of black smoke rose and gunfire pounded in between , israeli merkava tanks plowed through potato and strawberry fields on thursday as paratroopers guarded their ground , a mix of ruins that once were handsome twostory houses and farm fields that had been turned into rocketlaunching pads against by  on a day of unusually harsh israeli attacks inside the center of gaza city to the south , this neighborhood of atatra , in northwest gaza , was a scene of devastation on thursday , filled with impromptu tanktrack roads , rusting greenhouses and blownup houses that had been boobytrapped with mannequins , explosive devices and tunnels the area was a major site for hamas launchers over the past eight years but for the past 10 days , it has been a ghost town inhabited only by israeli soldiers , many of them from a paratroopers' unit , the 101 , founded in 1953 by ariel sharon , the former prime minister , as the first elite israeli unit aimed at striking guerrillas infiltrating from gaza the fact that more than half a century later israel remains at war with the children and grandchildren of those guerrillas has served as a kind of overpowering historical backdrop to the 20dayold military confrontation that israel says is aimed at ending hamas rocket fire onto israeli towns no one believes this will be the last war israelis face harsh censure abroad for their tactics , but a visit by 10 foreign reporters to this position arranged by the israeli military showed an army that feels serenely confident that it is doing the right thing the army , which has banned foreign journalists from entering gaza on their own , has begun taking small groups to outer positions for briefings with commanders in the field it is a very righteous war and has the full support of public opinion , said brig gen avi ronzki , the military s chief rabbi , a west bank settler who spends most of his time these days on the battlefield encouraging the troops and who happened to be at a military campground in israel earlier on thursday our army is showing the way to stop terrorists and in order to win against terror we need to use a lot of force like the americans are doing in iraq and afghanistan across the border region , israel has lowered a kind of electronic curtain to prevent remotecontrol bombs , disabling even remote car locks well into israel the paratroop brigade commander , colonel herzi \( military rules forbid his giving a family name \) , was the chief briefer for the visit he arrived late in a massive merkava , popped out of a hatch and , m16 and binoculars hanging from his neck and shoulders , expressed his regrets what you see here is not a pleasant scene , he said , looking down at a militaryissued briefing book with talking points war is not pleasant i do n't like this environment i do n't like war his soldiers took this area on the first night of the ground invasion a week into the war the rocket launchers , which sent deadly projectiles into ashdod and ashkelon , israeli cities due north , were placed among the potatoes and peppers , explosive devices around them to prevent their dismantling colonel herzi said the soldiers found improvised explosive devices in the houses and , on wednesday , in a mosque the typical ruse for the houses was a mannequin with an explosive nearby and a hole or tunnel covered by a rug i can say that onethird of the houses are boobytrapped , he said you get into the houses and you see many ied s we had one officer who got married one day before this operation started , and then five days into it he was badly wounded and is now between life and death after an ied exploded in a boobytrapped house colonel herzi showed large glossy pictures of what had been seen and captured , including mannequins and tunnels with ladders , ied s and rocket launchers the idea behind the setups in some of the houses , he and other officers said , was that israeli soldiers would shoot the mannequin , mistaking it for a man an explosion would occur and the soldiers would be driven or pulled into the hole , where they could be taken prisoner none have yet suffered that fate that may be partly because shortly after taking this neighborhood , the soldiers found a handdrawn map with the booby traps laid out the elaborate nature of the snares impressed colonel herzi , but he and his men said they had grown increasingly less impressed with the hamas fighters themselves they are villagers with guns , said sergeant almog , a gunner on an armored personnel carrier they do n't even aim when they shoot seven members of his unit were wounded by a rocketpropelledgrenade attack on wednesday , he said but he added , we kept saying hamas was a strong terror organization , but it was more easy than we thought it would be the war has been successful , but not necessarily decisive , from israel s perspective , colonel herzi said , especially as talk of a ceasefire has grown i know that in the end hamas will say they won , he said it does n't matter what will be the end of this war we know they know today that they have a problem will they put down their weapons forever \? for sure , no , but i think they have learned a lesson from this war
los angeles there are more stores here than public schools signs emblazoned with cannabis plants or green crosses sit next to dry cleaners , gas stations and restaurants the dispensaries range from hollywooddayspa fabulous to shoddylooking storefronts with handpainted billboards absolute herbal pain solutions , grateful meds , farmacopeia organica cannabis advocates claim that more than 800 dispensaries have sprouted here since 2002 some law enforcement officials say it is closer to 1 , 000 whatever the real number , everyone agrees it is too high and so this , too , is taken for granted crackdowns on cannabis clubs will soon come in this city , which has more dispensaries than any other for the first time , law enforcement officials in los angeles have vowed to prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries that turn a profit , with police officials saying they expect to conduct raids their efforts are widely seen as a campaign to sway the city council into adopting strict regulations after two years of debate it appears to be working carmen a trutanich , the newly elected city attorney , recently persuaded the council to put aside a proposed ordinance negotiated with medical marijuana supporters for one drafted by his office the new proposal calls for dispensaries to have renewable permits , submit to criminal record checks , register the names of members with the police and operate on a nonprofit basis if enacted , it is likely to result in the closing of hundreds of marijuana dispensaries mr trutanich argued that state law permits the exchange of marijuana between growers and patients on a nonprofit and noncash basis only marijuana advocates say that interpretation would regulate dispensaries out of existence and thwart the will of voters who approved medical cannabis in 1996 whatever happens here will be closely watched by law enforcement officials and marijuana advocates across the country who are threading their way through federal laws that still treat marijuana as an illegal drug and state laws that are increasingly allowing medicinal use thirteen states have laws supporting medical marijuana , and others are considering new legislation no state has gone further than california , often described by drug enforcement agents as a source nation because of the vast quantities of marijuana grown here and no city in the state has gone further than los angeles this has alarmed local officials , who say that dispensary owners here took unfair advantage of vague state laws intended to create exceptions to marijuana prohibitions for a limited number of ill people about 100 percent of dispensaries in los angeles county and the city are operating illegally , said steve cooley , the los angeles county district attorney , who is up for reelection in 2012 the time is right to deal with this problem mr cooley , speaking last week at a training luncheon for regional narcotics officers titled the eradication of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city of los angeles and los angeles county , said that state law did not allow dispensaries to be forprofit enterprises mr trutanich , the city attorney , went further , saying dispensaries were prohibited from accepting cash even to reimburse growers for labor and supplies he said that a recent california supreme court decision , people v mentch , banned all overthecounter sales of marijuana other officials and marijuana advocates disagree so far , prosecutions of marijuana dispensaries in los angeles have been limited to about a dozen in the last year , said sandi gibbons , a spokeswoman for mr cooley but police department officials said they were expecting to be called on soon to raid collectives i do n't think this is a law that we 'll have to enforce 800 times , said one police official , who declined to speak on the record before the marijuana ordinance was completed this is just like anything else you do n't have to arrest everyone who is speeding to make people slow down don duncan , a spokesman for , a leader in the medical marijuana movement , said that overthecounter cash purchases should be permitted but that dispensaries should be nonprofit organizations he also said marijuana collectives needed more regulation and a thinning of the herd i am under no illusions that everyone out there is following the rules , said mr duncan , who runs his own dispensary in west hollywood but just because you accept money to reimburse collectives does not mean you 're making profits for marijuana advocates , los angeles represents a critical juncture a symbol of the movement s greatest success , but also its vulnerability more than 300 , 000 doctors' referrals for medical cannabis are on file , the bulk of them from los angeles , according to americans for safe access the movement has had a string of successes in the legislature and at the ballot box in the city of garden grove , marijuana advocates forced the highway patrol to return six grams of marijuana it had confiscated from an eligible user about 40 cities and counties have medical marijuana ordinances but there have also been setbacks in june , a federal judge sentenced charles c lynch , a dispensary owner north of santa barbara , to one year in prison for selling marijuana to a 17yearold boy whose father had testified that they sought out medical marijuana for his son s chronic pain the mayor and the chief of police testified on behalf of mr lynch , who was released on bail pending appeal and last month , san diego police officers and sheriff s deputies , along with agents from the , raided 14 marijuana dispensaries and arrested 31 people in an interview , bonnie dumanis , the district attorney for san diego county , said that state laws governing medical marijuana were unclear and that the city had not yet instituted new regulations ms dumanis said that she approved of medical marijuana clubs where patients grow and use their own marijuana , but that none of the 60 or so dispensaries in the county operated that way these guys are drug dealers , she said of the 14 that were raided i said publicly , if anyone thinks we 're casting too big a net and we get a legitimate patient or a lawful collective , then show us your taxes , your business license , your incorporation papers , your filings with the department of corporations if they had these things , we would n't prosecute , she said marijuana supporters worry that san diego may provide a glimpse of the near future for los angeles if raids here become a reality but many look to harborside health center in oakland as a model for how dispensaries could work our no 1 task is to show that we are worthy of the public s trust in asking to distribute medical cannabis in a safe and secure manner , said steve deangelo , the pigtailed proprietor of harborside , which has been in business for three years harborside is one of four licensed dispensaries in oakland run as nonprofit organizations it is the largest , with 74 employees and revenues of about 20 million last summer , the oakland city council passed an ordinance to collect taxes from the sale of marijuana , a measure that mr deangelo supported mr deangelo designed harborside to exude legitimacy , security and comfort visitors to the lowslung building are greeted by security guards who check the required physicians' recommendations inside , the dispensary looks like a bank , except that the floor is covered with hemp carpeting and the eight tellers stand behind identical displays of marijuana and hashish there is a laboratory where technicians determine the potency of the marijuana and label it accordingly \( harborside says it rejects 80 percent of the marijuana that arrives at its door for insufficient quality \) there is even a bank vault where the day s cash is stored along with reserves of premium cannabis an armored truck picks up deposits every evening city officials routinely audit the dispensary s books surplus cash is rolled back into the center to pay for free counseling sessions and for patients oakland issued licenses and regulations , and los angeles did nothing and they are still unregulated , mr deangelo said cannabis is being distributed by inappropriate people but even oakland s regulations fall short of mr trutanich s proposal that los angeles ban all cash sales i do n't know of any collective that operates in the way that is envisioned by this ordinance , said mr duncan , of americans for safe access christine gasparac , a spokeswoman for state attorney general , said that after mr trutanich s comments in los angeles , law enforcement officials and advocates from around the state had called seeking clarity on medical marijuana laws mr brown has issued legal guidelines that allow for nonprofit sales of medical marijuana , she said but , she added , with laws being interpreted differently , the final answer will eventually come from the courts
washington he has been called a socialist by angry critics on the right , an accommodationist by disappointed fans on the left and a pragmatist by his staff , who normally eschews labels , pinned on one of his own last week by declaring himself a new democrat after eight weeks in office , mr obama has managed to satisfy or outrage nearly everyone on the ideological spectrum but his oncemurky governing philosophy is coming into sharper focus as he pivots from the opening days of his presidency to lay out a broader agenda for the rest of his term obamaism , as it is shaping up , appears to be an amalgam of philosophies a strong belief in the role of an activist government in shaping the economy and redistributing wealth , and a more centrist view of national security and at least some cultural issues mr obama has advanced the most expansive spending programs of any president in generations while moderating , but not wholly dismantling , the wartime policies of his predecessor and speaking to some of the values often embraced by conservatives the complex blend of ideas and instincts has proved advantageous in electoral politics , helping him win the presidency by blurring differences and appealing across lines but now in office , it may force him to build different legislative coalitions depending on the issue , a tricky challenge given the scope of his ambition he has rallied liberals behind efforts to overhaul health care , tackle and raise taxes on the rich but he has challenged liberal orthodoxy on issues like linking teacher pay to performance and has won republican support for sending 17 , 000 more troops to afghanistan and pulling out of iraq more gradually than the left wanted the answer is yes , he is all of those things , but none of them in toto , said michael berman , a longtime democratic strategist i would likely describe him as a moderate who is instinctively comfortable with a variety of progressive positions he is very hard to label and my guess is that that is the way he likes it that has sometimes confused opponents trying to pin down his philosophy you could pick any moment out of the last few weeks and make a diametrically opposite conclusion , so i just do n't know , said representative paul d ryan , republican of wisconsin he just got here , and when he got to the senate he started running for president so nobody up here really knows him other presidents came to office with longer histories on the national stage and more defined ideological identities , even if actions in office did not always match their images ronald reagan was the cold warrior denouncing government as the problem , not the solution bill clinton was the original new democrat nudging his party toward the center george w bush was the compassionate conservative sanding the harsher edges off newt gingrich s revolution mr obama , with only two years in the senate before starting his presidential campaign , arrived as something of a cipher a rorschach test , as he once put it who often seemed to be whatever people wanted to him to be while compiling a reliably liberal record , he made enough nods toward the other side that he put moderates and some conservatives at ease just before his inauguration , 40 percent of americans surveyed by the new york times and cbs news considered mr obama a liberal , while 34 percent called him a moderate and 13 percent a conservative even now , aides point to high approval ratings to argue that americans are comfortable with his approach and that his critics are out of step he s not an ideologue , said david axelrod , his senior white house adviser he s a pragmatist he s someone who s interested in ideas that will work some may have their roots in one doctrine some may have roots in another but he s not concerned about that he s less concerned about how he s described than what he can accomplish during a recent interview with the times , mr obama rejected the socialist tag , arguing that he was only returning top tax rates to where they were before mr bush asked if liberal or progressive better defined his philosophy , he said , i'm not going to engage in that days later , though , he did engage during a closeddoor meeting with moderate house democrats , later reported by mr obama called himself a new democrat , a term popularized under mr clinton referring to democrats who are fiscally conservative , socially liberal and relatively hawkish on foreign affairs if you asked him , i think he 'd put himself on the ideological scale as a new democrat , said rahm emanuel , the white house chief of staff but i think he 'd say that does n't fully capture it others said mr obama does not fit the new democrat model where mr clinton overhauled welfare and balanced the budget , mr obama has overseen more than 1 trillion in spending to fix the economy , set aside 634 billion over 10 years to expand health coverage and proposed forcing industry to pay for pollution credits president obama is turning out to be utterly and conventionally liberal , embracing recordbreaking spending programs and recordbreaking tax increases and giving us a recordbreaking deficit and recordbreaking debt , peter wehner , a former bush aide , wrote on commentary magazine s web site liberals likewise do not view him as a new democrat here s a label if you want one pragmatic populist progressive , said justin ruben , executive director of moveonorg , an influential group on the left it s not firebreathing populism it does n't necessarily look the same but what he s saying is this has to work for everyone but in a pragmatic way john d podesta , who led mr obama s transition , says the president has embraced the trialanderror approach employed by predecessors that traces back to progressive roots in the kinds of experimentation in reform you saw under teddy roosevelt and the experimentation you saw under franklin roosevelt , he said at the same time , mr obama has upheld much of the bush security architecture while ordering the closing of the prison at guant namo bay , cuba , mr obama endorsed some bush positions on holding detainees , guarding state secrets and snatching terrorism suspects from other countries on the cultural front , mr obama has liberalized policies on abortion and research , but also embraced issues favored by the other side , making responsibility a regular theme of his rhetoric and retaining mr bush s office of and he has resisted calls by liberal allies to investigate the bush team senator patrick j leahy , a vermont democrat who proposed such a truth commission , said he understood mr obama s position he has to govern the whole country , mr leahy said he has to bring us back together former representative tom davis of virginia , a republican , said mr obama was smart to avoid fights on secondary issues what s really dominant right now is the economy , mr davis said you ca n't afford to alienate people on the cultural front or the national security front while you 're fixing the economy
london generally auction houses like to keep significant staff departures under wraps until the sales season is over but word has leaked out even before the summer auction season starts here next week that guy bennett , a cohead of christie s impressionist and modern art department worldwide , has resigned from the auction house i'm going to take some time off , he said on wednesday , and see what my options are in the fall a 12year christie s veteran , mr bennett has been one of the company s biggest rainmakers most recently he ran the international impressionist and modern art department with thomas seydoux officials at christie s said mr seydoux would assume full responsibility of the department worldwide last summer at christie s in london , one painting a rare example of monet s water lilies sold for more than 80 million on tuesday night its entire impressionist and modern here is estimated to bring 62 million to 847 million like the financial markets , the value of most artists' work has fallen , with buyers wondering if they 've seen the bottom yet , and sellers preferring to hang on to their collections until prices start rising again the results of the may impressionist , modern and contemporary art auctions in new york proved that there was still cash and an appetite for art but a sea change in taste , prices and buyers' habits has affected the summer london auction season , which starts here next week the catalogs are noticeably thinner they are also filled with conservative and commercially safe works at estimates that are meant to entice collectors getting a sale together was slightly easier than it was in may , said guy bennett of christie s there s a bit more confidence than there was still , it has been tough the rage for late picassos has n't abated blame larry gagosian , whose new york exhibition mosqueteros \( or musketeers \) attracted about 100 , 000 visitors before it closed on june 6 or blame two recent museum shows picasso challenging the past at the national gallery in london and picasso and the masters at the grand palais in paris hoping to capitalize on this trend , sotheby s and christie s each have picassos two paintings of musketeers made a day apart that are the top lots in their sales picasso is still a cornerstone of the marketplace , mr bennett said and these later paintings are much sought after because they are both powerful and far more affordable than his early canvases christie s musketeer is titled man with a sword , dated july 26 , 1969 , and belongs to the saudi arabian juffali family one member bought the painting from the auction house here four years ago for 5 million experts now say it should bring about 75 million to 106 million sotheby s picasso , which has the same title , is dated july 25 , 1969 a colorful canvas , it is being sold by john tolleson , the dallas financier , who bought it in 2000 from landau fine art , a montreal gallery , for what experts say was about 6 million sotheby s has estimated it will bring about 89 million to 118 million collectors are looking for bluechip works that will hold their value , said helena newman , vice chairwoman of sotheby s impressionist and modern art department worldwide besides these late picassos , both auction houses are trying to take advantage of the hunger for classic impressionist paintings that was seen at the new york spring auctions the cover of christie s tuesdaynight sale catalog is of monet s at park monceau , an 1878 sundappled canvas of figures in the paris park while the catalog says it is property of a private american collector , experts say it is being sold by brook j lenfest , the philadelphia philanthropist who bought it at sotheby s in london eight years ago for 52 million now it is estimated to sell for 53 million to 68 million sotheby s has a later monet for sale too the road to giverny in winter , an 1885 snowy landscape being sold by the international art center , a company owned by the nahmad family , dealers with galleries in new york and london it is estimated at 44 million to 59 million this same bluechip mentality extends to the contemporary art sales there s definitely a propensity for the classic , said oliver barker , a senior international expert at sotheby s the sales have a more conservative feeling to them and both auction houses say they have kept estimates as low as possible to lure bidders who like to think there are bargains to be had the auctions at sotheby s , christie s and phillips de pury are all small , about 40 lots and none are offering young emerging artists phillips has the weakest sale , which includes several works belonging to charles saatchi , the british collector , gallery owner and advertising magnate he struck a deal with the auction house last year when he opened his new gallery in london phillips agreed to help subsidize the gallery s free admission , but in exchange , mr saatchi agreed to conduct most of his sales through phillips sotheby s and christie s have far stronger auctions sotheby s top works include a 1963 painting by warhol a nineyearold canvas by peter doig and a 1934 standing mobile by calder all artists whose markets have stayed relatively robust christie s is featuring paintings by gerhard richter , mr doig and cy twombly at the new york sales last month , sotheby s and christie s shied away from trendier names like damien hirst , richard prince and takashi murakami , artists whose prices have seen the largest drop since the fall but in london each auction house has included examples of work

palo alto , calif on the hour they come , great clouds of cyclists pulsing between classes along the street called serra mall the main axis of stanford university like so many slowly charged particles in a physics experiment campus is flat enough and large enough and the weather so brilliant that nearly everyone cycles and whoever all these cyclists are , as individuals , their individuality is burnished by the bikes they ride and by the way they ride them it s as though the bikes are only partly transportation , as though they were really machines for differentiation and what aids the differencing is that few people wear helmets , and everyone is wearing ordinary clothes none of the sleek and gaudy costumes you see on cyclists pumping through the peninsular hills and whistling down sand hill road to the caltrain station they are themselves on wheels there is a deeply pleasing randomness about the campus cyclists , as though one morning university officials had assigned a bicycle to every member of the stanford community , come as you are , without considering for a moment matters of fit or fitness some riders are clearly adepts , like the ones riding fixies fixed , singlegear bikes there goes one now zooming past on yellowwalled tires , riding fully upright , texting with both hands on his iphone as he goes but all around him there are cyclists riding la 8 years old , prey to the wobbling clutches of gravity , prone to every distorting posture a bicycle can inflict one pedals past with his saddle tipped up so far that he rides slipping backward , hanging onto the handlebar to keep from falling into the rear wheel one rides highkneed , spilling all the energy as he pedals a cluster of young women comes along , one with streamers flying from her handgrips , all with handlebars high and seats low , knees gesticulating as they go one tugs at her hem as she rides one rides in heels and pinions a cellphone between her shoulder and her ear the women are only accidentally riding together , and , suddenly , through the group nearly dispersing it pedals a subcluster of young women on mountain bikes , agile , balanced , weight forward , utterly at home on two wheels behind them rides a young man wearing a king tut headdress , glistening in the sun , churning furiously in a gear too low and everyone everyone is a hostage to gravity , adding to their burden by carrying distended bags of every description the champion is a woman who cycles past wearing a golf bag like a quiver across her back truly , we are the only species so discontented with our natural gaits , so ambitious to exceed a footpace it all puts me in mind of thomas jefferson , on the subject of walking and horses and their deleterious effect on human exercise i doubt , he wrote , whether we have not lost more than we have gained , by the use of this animal
it s a congressional recess week here in washington , so it s hardly surprising that capitol hill is a quiet and sleepy place but one area where the silence is particularly notable is surrounding the curious case of senator roland w burris , democrat of illinois mr burris was scheduled to be in the middle of a fiveday listening tour of illinois this week but on thursday , a trip to rockford was postponed , according to a statement from his office , in order to hold private meetings as the senator was out of public view , none of his colleagues in washington or his allies in chicago came to his aid or , for that matter , to say anything at all about his future mr burris is under investigation by the senate ethics committee , as well as an illinois prosecutor , over his evolving descriptions of what transpired before he was asked to fill the senate seat vacated by barack obama it is the latest episode in the gubernatorial legacy of rod blagojevich , who appointed mr burris in a controversial lastditch act mr burris has acknowledged that he tried to solicit fundraising money for mr blagojevich but he has stopped answering direct questions , instead referring an audience in chicago on wednesday to consider a record i have built over a lifetime 30 years in public life and never a hint of a scandal his tenure in washington , though , is on the cusp of only 30 days and it remains an open question what the future holds one senior official said thursday that mr burris has received private word that he should consider resigning , a proposition that he has declined to discuss so far , not the senate leadership , his rankandfile colleagues or officials at the white house have been eager to take the first step in saying what should happen to mr burris senator richard jr durbin of illinois , the state s senior democrat , issued a sharplyworded statement on wednesday that the accuracy and completeness of his testimony and affidavits have been called into serious question he said the news reports and mr burris own statements are troubling and raise serious questions which need to be looked at very carefully congressional officials say they are looking to illinois prosecutors to take action and illinois lawmakers seem to be looking back at washington for some type of a signal did one such signal come from the white house in a littlenoticed remark on wednesday afternoon \? a reporter asked the press secretary , robert gibbs , whether mr burris should resign i m not going to get ahead of investigations and say anything like that yet , mr gibbs said asked on thursday whether he had any additional thoughts , a white house spokesman said the statement by mr gibbs would stand right down to the word yet
baghdad tears streamed down the woman s cheeks as she held a baby boy , about 6 months old , rescued by her son from the wreckage of a car damaged by a bombing on tuesday that killed eight people , apparently including the baby s mother the baby , whose tiny face was cut by glass shards , had yet to be claimed by anyone the woman , umm assad alkhafaji , whose son assad raad alkhafaji had saved the baby , cleaned him up , dressed him in pajamas that belonged to one of her granddaughters and fed him milk from a bottle the jean overalls he had worn hours earlier were stained with blood the baby smiled as he looked around the khafajis' living room for mrs khafaji , the baby was a miracle and a gift from heaven for people in the nawab section of the kadhimiya district in baghdad , the khafaji family and other neighbors were heroes their actions seemed to be proof that six years of numbing violence have n't dulled iraqis' capacity for extraordinary acts of humanity the victims are iraqis how can we not aid and defend them \? asked sadiq khalaf almaliki , 36 , who had pulled the charred body of the woman presumed to be the baby s mother from the burning white peugeot sedan they were riding in around noon on tuesday , mr maliki was on his way to fix his motorbike at one of the many repair shops that dot nawab street in kadhimiya , the predominantly shiite district in northwestern baghdad that is home to a revered shiite shrine suddenly , a large explosion went off a few hundred yards from him a car bomber had been waiting in line at a police checkpoint before abandoning his explosivespacked vehicle , according to a police colonel and witnesses in addition to the eight dead , at least 20 people were wounded ignoring the risk of a second bomb , mr maliki rushed to aid the victims he said he saw the dead and injured everywhere , including an old woman sprawled on the median screaming i want abbas where is my son \? he then made his way to a peugeot that was on fire inside he saw the driver slumped at the wheel , dead , and a folded stroller in the seat next to him in the back lay a woman s charred body next to a colorful baby blanket minutes earlier , mr khafaji , who repairs motorbikes , had rushed to the same car , reached for the baby through an open window and taken him to his home nearby in that sense , the baby was luckier than others who had been wounded in the bombing after iraqi security forces arrived , they fired shots to disperse the crowd and scuffled with some of the rescuers , witnesses said , preventing many of the wounded from getting help order was restored when american troops arrived , witnesses said issa salim , a minivan driver , said lives could have been saved if it were not for the chaos that ensued he said that he saw a man walk away from his car , bleeding , and that the man was dead by the time an ambulance reached him the khafajis , meanwhile , called a number on the peugeot driver s cellphone and established that the man was not the baby s father but a taxi driver hired by the woman they had none of the woman s possessions to help them track down the baby s family mrs khafaji and her son , a burly and bearded 26yearold , gazed at the oblivious baby in her arms and started crying what future will this baby have without his mother \? she said many iraqi children have been orphaned why \?
my eyes roll every time i hear someone say , this tournament is wide open the colonial athletic association tournament is wide open ok , so maybe uncwilmington and towson aren t going to win it , but eyerolling aside , there are a lot of teams that have a legitimate chance to do so it is wide open , james madison coach matt brady said after his team lost a 9996 doubleovertime thriller at hofstra wednesday night a lot of teams with very good recent history of postseason play george mason , old dominion , vcu , hofstra s been in the nit , drexel s been in the nit so there re no easy games add northeastern and brady s own jmu team to the mix and you ve got seven teams with winning conference records , none of which has established itself as a clear favorite in fact , drexel was picked last in the caa preseason poll , so it s a prognosticator s nightmare and with no chance of the league s getting an atlarge ncaa tournament bid this year , the battle becomes even juicier it may come down to which four teams earn a firstround caa tournament bye we re all battling so hard to get the bye , but to win the championship you ve got to have the bye , hofstra coach tom pecora said history hasn t lied and if you don t get the bye \? let s go make history the bonus hofstra s tournament xfactor \( zfactor \? \) may be 3point specialist zygis sestokas , who seems to have been rescued from the proverbial scrap heap in recent games the team s best pure shooter , the senior had mostly been buried on the bench since his sophomore year , but he logged career highs of 43 minutes and 19 points against james madison , including three straight triples in the decisive second overtime ziggy opens up a hofstra offense that can often be hard on the eyes if they were winning without me , i was happy for them , but then we struggled a bit , so that was the toughest time , sestokas said of his previous inactivity
santiago , chile when gen augusto pinochet held a referendum on his rule in 1988 , a surge of young voters was the decisive difference in emphatically turning the country toward democracy but as chileans head to the polls on sunday , with the fate of the 20year old governing coalition in the balance , young voters are not likely to play a major role even as its democracy has matured and its steady economic management has become the envy of latin america , s youngest citizens have developed a serious case of political apathy just 92 percent of 18to29yearolds are registered to vote on sunday , the lowest number for a presidential election since democracy was restored in 1990 , and slightly lower than the percentage registered in 2005 when chileans elected michelle bachelet , the first woman to become president she is not allowed to seek a second consecutive term under the constitution i hope that 9 percent becomes zero percent , said gonzalo castillo , an 18yearold history major at the university of chile , who said he refused to register all the candidates represent the interests of the oligarchy , of big business interests chile s young people say they are frustrated by a system that requires anyone who registers to cast votes for the rest of their lives , and slaps a fine on those who do not they say the system , set up under general pinochet , limits their freedom of expression and discourages them from registering but the younger generation is also deeply apathetic about traditional politics in general , and fiercely independent of the issues that concern their parents , most of whom lived through the dictatorship chile s youth today see political discourse as the language of their parents , not as their language , said juan eduardo fa ndez , the director of the national youth institute these are the children of democracy , and they have other options and other demands of chilean society , and of the political class chile s youth seem willing to engage in politics when an issue directly touches their lives in the socalled penguin revolution of 2006 , tens of thousands of high school students , many wearing uniforms with little dark ties on white shirts , protested throughout the country to demand improvements in the education system the president ended up negotiating with the student leaders and gave in to most of their demands but voting is another matter not even the youthful energy and ideas of a 36yearold filmmaker , marco enr quezominami , who is running as an independent , has been enough to draw them to the polls this year mr enr quezominami , who resigned as a congressman from the socialist party to run for president , has nevertheless shaken up the race between the governing concertaci n coalition and its rightwing challenger in polls last week , sebastian pi era , a rightofcenter billionaire businessman , was leading with 44 percent , over the 31 percent supporting eduardo frei , a former president who is seeking to succeed ms bachelet in the unbroken line of concertaci nbacked presidents mr enr quezominami , who grew up partly in exile in france , was in third place with about 18 percent , according to polls , enough to deprive any candidate of the majority required to avoid a runoff in january but with 16 percent of the electorate still undecided the highest number heading into a presidential election since 1988 the results were difficult to forecast , analysts said concertaci n , a coalition of socialists , radicals and christian democrats , built the postdictatorship democracy and put in place social programs and stable , marketfriendly economic policies , all of which have won chile international respect but this election , concertaci n refused to hold primaries to select its candidate , denying outsiders the chance to compete that gave mr enr quezominami an opportunity to market himself as independent outsider his ability to mount a serious challenge suggests that some are weary of concertaci n , despite the success of ms bachelet , whose social programs and effective stewardship of the economy have won her a 74 percent approval rating in recent polls but her popularity has proven difficult to transfer the selection by party insiders of mr frei , 67 , whose father was also a president , has marked him as the staid product of the concertaci n machine , analysts said regardless of who wins on sunday , chile s marketfriendly economic policies are unlikely to change , as none of the candidates are proposing major reforms in that arena mr frei has pledged to expand the social programs begun by ms bachelet , who improved conditions for women and significantly increased the number of day care centers mr pi era said in a speech on friday that he would beef up public security and crack down on drug trafficking he also spoke of the need to address the concerns of the middle class , which he said were ignored during the bachelet years in an interview on friday , mr enr quezominami said he would push for political reform and improvements in education members of the bachelet government had hoped that younger voters could play a strategic role in this election , which has turned out to be one of the most competitive since free elections resumed in 1989 in 1988 , 95 percent of voters under 29 were registered , representing 36 percent of the total voters , according to government figures if all voters under 29 were registered today , they would make up 32 percent of eligible voters , mr fa ndez said but the number of registered young voters has declined steadily since 1988 and by last april , it had reached a historic low of 75 percent ms bachelet authorized a 1 million emergency voterregistration drive , which managed to add 170 , 000 voters in under two months , bringing the youth quotient back above 9 percent , mr fa ndez said mr enr quezominami , despite his attempts to appeal to younger voters as an independent , modern alternative , has also proven unable to push it higher he blamed the system of voluntary registration and mandatory voting for discouraging younger voters a vote should be a duty , not an obligation , he said ms bachelet tried in april to make registration automatic at 18 and voting voluntary but the measure failed in congress , where some feared it would cause voter participation to drop even further the failure of young chileans to vote has encouraged candidates to ignore their concerns it s a vicious cycle in which the people that control the country , to perpetuate themselves in power , are speaking only to the older generation , mr fa ndez said that chasm was palpable at the university of chile on friday the young people in chile have never felt like they were included in the political process , said sebastian alfaro , 19 , who said he was registered and would vote for mr enr quezominami we are just seen as a number to the candidates they never create concrete projects , propose policies just for young people

art objects are in crisis conceptualists and theorists say that there are too many of them and that we do n't need them any more also , people buy and sell them like commodities , which devalues them as vehicles of thought and feeling if you are one of those who still believe in the object , you may be annoyed by sculpturecenter s confusing and misleadingly titled current exhibition organized by mary ceruti , the center s executive director , the eightartist show the space of the work and the place of the object is meant , according to a news release , to address the status of the art object within the context of its production but there is almost nothing in the exhibition that you would call an art object in the traditional sense of the term something made by an artist , more or less skillfully , that is uncommonly interesting to look at because of its formal or representational properties the exhibition is a disconnected assortment of primarily conceptual works , none of which say anything very illuminating about the status of the object or its context of production consider an arrangement of partly broken glass boxes and the cardboard fedex cartons in which the glass boxes evidently were sent through the mail this piece by walead beshty is briefly amusing , but unless you read philosophical and political ideas into it , how different is it , really , from david letterman throwing a watermelon off the roof \? at least with mr letterman you get to see the object bursting the most interesting piece is an installation by michael rakowitz documenting a project in which he opened a storefront in brooklyn to sell food products from iraq it is almost impossible to find anything for sale in the united states labeled made in iraq , mr rakowitz said , because customs agencies here and abroad make it so difficult so iraqi merchants ship their goods to countries like syria and lebanon and have them labeled as made in those other places mr rakowitz decided to try to import a ton of iraqi dates in boxes labeled product of iraq to sell in his store after many complications , he succeeded , much to the delight of his iraqi customers it is an excellent and affecting lesson in geopolitics less edifying is gabriel kuri s that runs through , a presentation of objects on a sheet of white backdrop paper , including a bag of charcoal , a stone on a stack of financial times , a bag of kitty litter and a wastebasket with a mop head in it a poor man s robert gober \? also remarkably derivative are signs by carey young announcing various selfreflexive disclaimers , like the artist does not guarantee that this piece can be sold as a work of art and the artist does not represent this to be a work of art ms young should know about robert morris s 1963 statement of aesthetic withdrawal another sort of aesthetic withdrawal is an installation by blake rayne and gareth james consisting of big black wooden crates , a set of empty painting frames and a sheet of plastic and some balloons spraypainted green and gold the color of money perhaps the most entertaining work at least during the exhibition s first two weeks , when it was performed by live actors is a short play by melanie gilligan an art critic tells of a dream she had about wildly multiplying objects , and an artist in his studio gets all riled up about the obsolescence of the traditional art object the piece is now being presented as a video a less exciting performance has been orchestrated by karin schneider she built a second reception and ticketselling booth of woodframed transparent plastic and has the gallery s receptionist shuttle between it and the permanent booth , which serves as a studio where he makes paintings when not attending to visitors institutional critique feebly lives on one work that does resemble a fineart object is a squiggly , multilobed bronze sculpture by simon starling \( winner of the 2005 turner prize \) a wall label mystifyingly explains that it represents a single silver particle from a vintage gelatin silver photographic print of reclining figure no 4 , 1955' by henry moore enlarged 300 , 000 times so it seems that here , too , the idea is the real object

sleek , hissing serpent in the drab garden of everyday reality the alpha and the omega of the collaboration are the clothing designer and the photographer in between lies the crucial participation of magazine editors and graphic designers , hair and makeup artists , sets \( or setting \) , models and especially stylists \( the stylists' names are featured prominently on the exhibition labels , just below the photographers' \) the ceilingtofloor , pushpull installation alternates between art and commerce in all ways tear sheets mounted on board dominate , but selected images repeat as large framed prints for further delectation there are regular appearances from the field s leading lights , especially steven klein , but also solve sundsbo , miles aldridge and the team mert alas and marcus piggott , along with onetime visits from some artists , including cindy sherman \( doing her own styling \) , collier schorr and sara vanderbeek the versatile terence koh does a turn as a stylist also here are photographers who move easily between art gallery and fashion magazine , like juergen teller and philiplorca dicorcia in these images , mouths are smeared with lipstick hats are displayed on skulllike busts of burned plastic foam the narratives veer from frothy fantasy to surprisingly hardbitten americana , as in the unstyled backyard images by lise sarfati , who began her career as a photojournalist and the sexual innuendos and stereotypes never stop betty boop , baby doll , maneater , slut , saint , sm toy nor do the shifting shades of gender in several spreads women s garments and undergarments are modeled by beautiful young men clothes for the average woman or man have little place here fashion photography is , as others have noted , a cousin of performance art the choreography is delicate , and the risk of flameout considerable , as even this show attests the intent is to mesmerize and intimidate with as much fabulousness as can be wedged onto a small tract of glossy paper this entails exploiting the latest cultural trends with parasitical finesse the spreads here make allusions to matthew barney and appropriation art to movie and television hits like desperate housewives , blonde ambition and crash to early experimental photography and to the giants of fashion photography for example , in forty something \( w magazine \) , michael thompson pays tribute to the icy elegance of irving penn with minimalist evocations of 1950s d cor and a swanlike woman who resembles mr penn s favorite model , his wife , lisa fonssagrivespenn most of these images refine and distill an unease with the body that pervades real life using metallic leggings , david sims and the stylist joe mckenna turn an ultrathin model into an anorexic robot mr dicorcia all but pushes his models out of the pictures ever the formalist , mr sundsbo projects blackandwhite opart stripes and dots on his in the spread a magic world \( vogue italia \) , tim walker , working with the stylist jacob k , swings both ways some models are veritable xrays others are puffballs of tulle it s hieronymus bosch meets the sugarplum fairy mr klein , working with the stylist katie grand , takes an antianorexic position in the feature size hero \( from pop magazine \) it stars a voluptuous model who resembles divine , of john waters fame , in circumstances that bring to mind william eggleston and diane arbus one of the most sumptuous spreads is prints and the revolution \( v magazine \) , in which mr klein and the stylist panos yiapanis fill the frame with printed garments , layered onto or piled around the models with their blond blankness and chinoiserie motifs painted on their faces , these creatures bring to mind the daryl hannah of blade runner relegated to matisse s textile storage it probably does n't reflect well on me that i wanted this show to go on forever it was organized by one of the center s curators , carol squiers , and an adjunct curator , vince aletti , who whittled several hundred spreads down to the 61 featured in weird beauty they should expand the show outward again , into a book in this is not a fashion photograph , a small second show nearby , mr aletti has provided the perfect antidote to the extreme artifice of weird beauty working primarily with the center s collection , he has selected and arranged cheekbyjowl about 70 photographs of real life they range from jacob riis s police station lodgers east 22 st , taken around 1892 , to a recent image by ingar krauss the intervening images are by berenice abbott , lisette model , michael disfarmer , danny lyon , carrie mae weems , malick sidib and yasumasa morimura the show substantiates the influence of nonfashion photography on the fashion kind , but also perhaps their inseparability faces , bodies and garments are among the most telling elements in most of the photographs pose , style and even fashion are not far behind edward steichen in high fashion the cond nast years , 19231937 fills most of the available gallery space downstairs after weird beauty it is a trifle dull , even though the two shows enhance each other markedly steichen reminds us that fashion photography has its own short but definite history weird beauty reflects its tremendous forward momentum steichen \( 18791973 \) began as a painter who took up photography and joined alfred stieglitz and the photo secessionists in the fight to win the medium acceptance as a fine art but during world war i , steichen took aerial photographs for the allies and became increasingly drawn to what he called useful , or commercial , photography in 1923 he returned to new york from paris , broke and divorced , with childsupport obligations the job of chief photographer at cond nast was a godsend , even though stieglitz and company deemed him a traitor to the cause in images taken primarily for vanity fair and vogue , steichen established the conventions of fashion and portrait photography he took models out of the studio intimated narratives used unexpected devices like masks alluded to art he even seems to have a nurtured a protosupermodel , most notably the imposing actress marion morehouse , a tall young woman with a face and head out of brancusi today steichen s photographs seem musty , about as far from contemporary fashion photography as silent films are from the latest movies his models tended to fade into the drapery or to occupy the center of his prints , surrounded by empty space , as in traditional paintings the celebrity portraits are a different story steichen drew nearer to his subjects they dominate the frame in a wise , expressive portrait of the young actress sylvia sidney , or his picture of paul robeson as the emperor jones but steichen was probably interested in famous people , since he had always seen himself as something of a star the show includes a short , fawning film from 1937 that suggests as much it shows him working in his studio , head jauntily cocked , cigar in mouth , wearing his box camera s dark cloth like a cape and graciously directing models he s ever gallant , except for a noticeable fit of temper when an assistant leaves some electrical cords underfoot maybe he was just hamming it up for the camera the whole time , but it seems unlikely in photography steichen was something of a serial innovator in the areas of color and aerial photography , as well as fashion and portraiture you ca n't blame him if he did n't venture much beyond the conventions he helped establish but you can name other photographers from the period whose images , whether they are fashion or accidental fashion , seem newer august sander is one martin munkacsi , the subject of the fourth exhibition here , is another working in germany in the early 1930s , the hungarianborn munkacsi was a street and sports photographer who , turning to fashion , is generally credited with getting models to move he arrived in new york in 1934 , just as steichen was winding down at cond nast , and went to work at harper s bazaar , where he ushered in its best years munkacsi s lost archive is less an exhibition than a prelude to one it celebrates the center s acquisition of munkacsi s recently discovered archive of around 4 , 000 glass negatives , which is indicated by scores of small , yellowed boxes displayed in a wall vitrine the images on view include several shots of a model sitting in the jump seat of a moving automobile seeing them after the airless perfection of so many of steichen s images is like starting to breathe again a year of fashion photography exhibitions can sound like overkill , but the center is varying its menu these shows will be followed by a retrospective of richard avedon in may and next fall the museum s triennial will tackle the relationship between fashion photography and contemporary art
improvisers are always getting themselves into jams often the fun of watching them is seeing how they get themselves out or fail to the jams were plentiful on friday night , when the and performa 09 presented the american premiere of auf den tisch ! \( at the table ! \) in one of the center s sixthfloor studios the american choreographer meg stuart , long based in europe , was the curator for this improvisation project , and those lucky enough to get a seat at this big , rectangular table were witness to a sprawling feast laid by some of today s most captivating artists the choreographer yvonne meier , the composer hahn rowe and the performance artist keith hennessy , to name a few among the cast of 12 then again , if you were at the table , you were also part of the action , which might mean having a microphone thrust in your face , a shoe thrown into your lap , or a hand clamped none too gently onto your skull \( the skull was mine ow ! and the hand mr hennessy s , as he struggled to avoid hitting the table during a roughandtumble grappling sequence with anja m ller \) there was no way to take it all in , not at such close proximity but that was part of the pleasure just as the artists had to make choices , so too did viewers sometimes that choice was easy , as when david thomson stepped alone onto the table and arched his tall , eloquent body through a series of curvilinear turns to look up at him was to be reminded of dance as moving sculpture all the stage became his pedestal there was as much mouthing off as moving around later mr thomson and the slovenian author and artist janez jansa debated whether anyone in the room would stand up for nudity as the director and academic richard schechner had apparently done decades before at another public forum failing to secure a volunteer , mr jansa , clinging to a little balcony in the room , eventually stripped with the help of ms m ller it was a clever way out of what had seemed a dead end , suggesting how what was once revolutionary often becomes clich mr jansa , marvelously sly and thoughtful throughout , was one of several participants to use history as a complicating device there is a long , rich lineage behind a work like auf den tisch ! , which evoked thoughts of grand union , the seminal improvisational collective of the 1970s , and the revolutionary critic jill johnston s panel caricature of the previous decade panels are a big drag , that s what they are , ms johnston wrote in the village voice in 1968 ms stuart used the idea of a conference rather than a panel , but the almost twohour auf den tisch ! was sometimes , inevitably , a drag , mostly when the participants forced an intellectual conceit or did n't allow for enough quiet , enough stillness \( free of missteps were mr rowe s nuanced score , which drew on realtime recorded samples of his colleagues' voices , and jan maertens s gently shifting lighting , also improvised \) most people ca n't think on their feet as well as ms meier , a mischievous master improviser whose interjected comments and muscular bursts of movement always seemed just right the woman has chops but all of these artists have smarts all are pushing at the edges of their art , seeing where it will and wo n't go what a privilege to sit among them
washington house democrats working on energy and legislation remained deadlocked tuesday on several contentious issues even after a gentle nudge from president obama at a white house meeting but they did announce a tentative deal to give consumers billions of dollars to trade in their old cars and trucks for models with somewhat higher gas mileage that cash for clunkers subsidy is intended to increase vehicle sales , prop up the faltering american auto industry and make the nation s car and truck fleet marginally more efficient mr obama has lent support to the idea , and there is money in the to finance it democrats plan to include the deal in the broader energy bill unless that measure becomes hopelessly entangled in policy disputes under the provision , a buyer would receive a voucher toward the purchase of a new car or truck if that vehicle got a specific combined minimum miles per gallon in city and highway driving its would also have to exceed that of the vehicle being traded by a specific minimum the measure would apply to domestic and imported vehicles alike , last for one year and be capped at one million vouchers if consumers claimed all the vouchers , it would cost 35 billion to 45 billion the provision was just one piece of the vigorous horse trading under way to try to win the support of enough democrats to move the broader climate legislation through the house energy and commerce committee none of the 23 republicans on the panel have so far expressed support for the broader bill , and democratic members said tuesday that they remained far apart on the critical elements , including goals for emissions reductions , mandates for renewable electricity like wind and , and the issue of whether the government would give away any pollution permits rather than auctioning all of them the timetable for legislative action remains unclear , although the committee chairman , representative henry a waxman , democrat of california , renewed his pledge to have the panel clear a bill by the end of may mr obama told the nearly three dozen democratic lawmakers at the white house meeting that they were at a historic moment in the debate over global warming and energy independence , and he urged them to move as quickly as possible toward passage of the complex legislation , participants said the bill before the committee would set limits on carbon dioxide emissions , modernize the electrical transmission grid , finance work on cleaning up fired power plants and force large gains in the energy efficiency of buildings , appliances and vehicles
tommy haas has not lost on grass this season , but on friday he faces roger federer , who has lost only one match on centre court since 2002 haas is playing superb tennis at wimbledon , showing a gritty spirit in wins over marin cilic and novak djokovic at roland garros , haas led , two sets to none , and had a break point to serve for the match against federer he was five points from stopping federer s quest to win the elusive french haas rebounded well , winning halle on grass his confidence soared after beating djokovic in the final there and yesterday , when it looked as though he d blown an opportunity to take a twosetstonone lead over djokovic , he remained calm and came back to win the crucial second set tie breaker haas looks physically and mentally stronger than at any time since 2002 , when he rose to no 2 in the world haas , at 31 , is resurgent while haas is the surprise semifinalist at this year s wimbledon , roger federer is appearing in his 21st straight grand slam semifinal that is a record that will be almost impossible to break , and he is not done yet in analyzing this match tomorrow , it would be tempting to look at haas s stellar grasscourt play and his near upset of federer at roland garros and anticipate another fivesetter , or even a haas upset but federer looks different coming into this match with haas than he did at their french meeting there have been no scares \( like the jose acasuso match at the french \) and federer is serving much better in fact , he seemed to find his game after hitting an insideout forehand winner on the line on that break point against haas federer later said that he uttered the word , voila ! after hitting that forehand winner against haas in fact , since that match , the fed has lost only three sets , two to juan del potro in his five set semifinal win over the argentine in the semis of the french , and one to philipp kohlschreiber in a tiebreaker in the third round in haas s two signature wins at wimbledon , a fivesetter over marian cilic , and wednesday s fourset victory over djokovic , he served and volleyed on big points and came up with some great backhand passing shots when he was attacked but neither cilic nor djokovic hit their forehands with the force and accuracy of federer in fact , both players win with big serving and balanced backcourt play each has a stronger , more technically sound backhand if a side breaks down for either player , it s the forehand federer , by contrast , may have the best forehand of all time he will use it relentlessly tomorrow to hurry haas , taking the ball early to apply constant pressure federer passes too well for the haas serve and volley to work look for haas to press on his second serve , which will lead to double faults this match will be entirely different than last month s fivesetter at roland garros federer is in perfect form , and should win this match handily he is , as one astute observer put it , playing with house money now

boise , idaho \( ap \) when officer darryll dowell of the nampa police department is on patrol , he will pull up at a stoplight and start casing the vehicle next to him nowadays , his eyes will also focus on the driver s arms , searching for a plump , bouncy vein i was looking at people s arms and hands , thinking , i could draw from that , ' officer dowell said the thought stems from training he and a select cadre of officers in idaho and texas have received in recent months in drawing blood from people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol the aim of the federal program is to determine if drawing blood by lawenforcement officers can be an effective tool against drunken drivers and aid in their prosecution if the results seem promising after a year or two , the national highway traffic safety administration will encourage lawenforcement officers nationwide to undergo similar training the supreme court ruled in 1966 that the police could have blood tests forcibly done on a drunkendriving suspect without a warrant , as long as they were based on a reasonable suspicion that a suspect was intoxicated , and they were done after an arrest and carried out in a medically approved manner the practice of lawenforcement officers drawing blood , first done in arizona in 1995 , has raised concerns , though , about safety and the credibility of the evidence i would imagine that a lot of people would be wary of having their blood drawn by an officer on the hood of their police vehicle , said steve oberman , chairman of the national association of criminal defense lawyers' committee on driving while intoxicated for years , defense lawyers in idaho advised clients to always refuse breath tests , christine starr , a prosecutor in ada county , said when the state toughened the penalties for refusing the tests a few years ago , the problem lessened , but it is still the main reason that drunkendriving cases go to trial in the boise region , ms starr said idaho had a 20 percent breath test refusal rate in 2005 , compared with 22 percent nationally , according to a study by the national highway transportation safety administration ms starr said she hoped the new system would cut down on the number of drunkendriving trials the officer phlebotomists are generally trained under the same program as other phlebotomists in their state , but under a highly compressed schedule the officers are trained to take blood from the elbow crease , the forearm and the back of the hand if none are accessible , they are instructed to take the suspect to a hospital for testing in a nondescript boise office building where the nampa officers were trained , officer dowell scanned his subject and prepared to draw blood chase abston , an officer taking his turn playing a suspect , recoiled a bit , pressing his back deeper into the gray chair on which he was sitting officer dowell slid a finegauge needle into the back of officer abston s hand officer abston , who had been holding his breath , slowly exhaled as his blood began to flow all the officers seemed as if they would be more comfortable if their colleagues were wielding side arms instead of syringes they are making quick progress , said nicole watson , a phlebotomy instructor at the college of western idaho , who is teaching the officers their training will be complete after they have logged 75 successful blood draws once they are back on patrol in nampa , in southwestern idaho , they will draw blood from any suspected drunken driver who refuses a breath test they will use force if necessary , including getting help from another officer to pin down a suspect , ms watson said though most legal experts agree that blood tests measure blood alcohol more accurately than breath tests , mr oberman said they could be fraught with problems , too vials can be mixed up , preservative levels in the tubes used to collect the blood can be off or the blood can be stored improperly , causing it to ferment and have a higher alcohol content mr oberman said law enforcement agencies should also be concerned about possible malpractice cases over somebody who was not properly trained alan haywood , the law enforcement phlebotomy coordinator in arizona , is directing the training programs in idaho and texas mr haywood said that officers were exposed to some extra onthejob risk if they drew blood , but that good training and safe practices reduced the concerns if we ca n't get the evidence safely , we 're not going to endanger the officers or the public to collect that evidence , he said in phoenix , detective kemp layden , who oversees drug recognition , phlebotomy and field sobriety , said there were about 120 officers certified to draw blood typically , a suspect is brought to a precinct or mobile booking van for the blood draw under the state s implied consent law , drivers who refuse to voluntarily submit to the test lose their license for a year , so most comply for the approximately 5 percent who refuse , the officer obtains a search warrant from an oncall judge and the suspect can be restrained if needed to obtain a sample , detective layden said between 300 to 400 blood tests are done in an average month in phoenix , the nation s fifthlargest city during holiday months that number can rise to 500 , said detective layden , who reviews each case to make sure legal procedures were followed
washington forward alex ovechkin is perhaps the nhl s best player and certainly its most charismatic star , but he may also wind up as the driving force that keeps the league s players in the olympics the nhl has expressed doubts about participating in the 2014 games in sochi , russia , with league officials suggesting that the vancouver games this february may be the league s last commissioner gary bettman said last week that the in north america are way different than if you 're in japan , italy or russia because games from a site like sochi would probably not be televised during prime time , he said , i'm not sure that that type of exposure warrants or overcomes the difficulties of interrupting the nhl schedule but ovechkin , who was the the last two seasons , is outspoken about playing in the 2014 olympics , regardless of the league s decision nobody can say to me , you ca n't play for your country in the olympic games , ' , adding , if somebody says to me , you ca n't play , ' see ya his statement prompted other russian nhl stars to echo his sentiment , increasing the pressure on the league i completely agree with alex , the pittsburgh penguins' , adding , i would rather pay fines and still go ilya kovalchuk of the atlanta thrashers said , we 've declared that we are going to sochi in any case the has strongly endorsed olympic participation , and the issue could become a sticking point in negotiations over the next collective bargaining agreement the current agreement expires in 2011 ovechkin s stand did not waver thursday when asked about the olympics everybody knows what i feel , ovechkin said before the capitals' 43 loss to the rangers i said what i said , and i do n't change my mind ovechkin is , in many ways , the antithesis of the typical hockey star he is outgoing and at ease in the spotlight , unlike sidney crosby , the captain of the stanley cup champion penguins , who is softspoken and awkwardly deferential ovechkin seems to pop up in unlikely places in a video of washington kicking a being in a speech in moscow in july , ovechkin was for the sochi olympics , and he feels deeply about his homeland during an in august , he spoke of being recognized by a woman in a small store in siberia i 've played a lot for my country and i know what patriotism is , he was quoted as saying , adding i just felt what russia is about , how dear and big it is and how we hockey players and the national team are loved here when you think of people like those , you want to win the olympics twice as much the 2010 games will be the fourth olympics in which nhl players have participated and having the nhl s best players at the games created a surge of interest across canada and northern europe aside from concerns about the interruption of the nhl schedule , the league might also be reluctant to commit to sochi because of its dispute with the russian kontinental hockey league over player signings , transfer fees and control of the potentially lucrative european market none of that should matter , because these are the olympics , and the best players in the world should be playing in them , alexander medvedev , president of the khl , said in a telephone interview for people to speculate about keeping the best players out , it s destroying the olympics and it s hurting the growth of hockey the sochi games are still almost five years away , but if the nhl decides to participate , ovechkin may be seen as the man who tilted the balance
new york s state university system is among the largest in the country , but it has never been known for athletic prominence , unlike major public institutions in states like florida , pennsylvania and michigan suny officials aimed to change that in 1986 , when the trustees lifted a ban on athletic scholarships and cleared the way for the system s four research universities buffalo , stony brook , albany and binghamton to upgrade their sports programs buffalo led the way to division i in 1991 , ending new york s distinction as the only state system in the country , other than north dakota , south dakota alaska s , not competing at the highest level of intercollegiate sports since then , tens of millions of dollars have been invested toward the effort by new york state and the institutions themselves yet nearly two decades after the migration started , there is no clear consensus as to whether this project is an allaround success certain suny teams have risen on a national stage buffalo s football team played in a bowl game for the first time in january , and albany and binghamton have qualified for the exclusive and lucrative ncaa men s basketball tournament but there have also been public embarrassments along the way , none more glaring than at binghamton , which is facing an athletics scandal that has drawn national headlines the university is under investigation by the state s former chief judge now , with the university system facing a proposed 90 million cut in state financing , some are questioning whether the emphasis on athletics is misguided assemblyman peter m rivera , a democrat from the bronx , said state money should not be spent on building athletic powerhouses that s not the purpose of a suny school , he said the purpose of a suny school is to provide the best education possible those who defend the move to division i say that the benefits of highprofile sports programs , like other aspects of higher education , are difficult to measure i suppose you can say that the universities are all looking toward intangible goals in terms of student education , said shirley strum kenny , who helped bring division i sports to stony brook as its president from 1994 until her retirement this year there s very little way to measure it , unless you 're going to wait 40 years even if the benefits are not easy to assess , they are real to warde manuel , the buffalo athletic director , who arrived at the university in 2005 manuel had left a job as an associate athletic director at michigan and said he was stunned to see more buffalo students wearing michigan , syracuse and notre dame sweatshirts than their own school colors there was a sense of apathy , a sense of we ca n't win , ' he said since then , manuel said , the change has been palpable even though buffalo s football team is 37 this season , its international bowl appearance has generated enthusiasm on campus i think now there s an expectation that we will win , he said the scandal at binghamton highlights the way intangible sports benefits so sought after by university administrators like increased visibility and buzz can backfire the university into accusations that it bent its academic standards to build a competitive men s basketball team three of the team s players have been arrested in the past three years , including one in september on charges of selling crack cocaine this fall , six players were dismissed from the team the athletic director has resigned , the basketball coach has been placed on paid leave , and university administrators have been accused of retaliating against an instructor who said she was pressured to show grading favoritism to athletes binghamton s president , lois b defleur , declined to comment on the investigation but said that over all , the move to division i had enhanced the university s ties to its students as well as to the surrounding community the bulk of the people put a terrible event in perspective with the overall university and its other programs and what s going on , she said the adjustment has been painful at the other universities as well in 1999 , the ncaa placed buffalo s men s basketball team on probation for recruiting violations the ncaa has also cited buffalo s football team for the players' poor academic performance in 2006 , three albany football players were arrested on charges of raping a fellow student and were dismissed from the university and in 2005 , the ncaa placed stony brook on three years' probation for a series of minor violations involving more than 50 athletes the ncaa cited the university for a lack of institutional control , removed 12 scholarships for two years , and said stony brook had been illequipped to handle the transition supporters of suny s move to division i caution patience , noting that building a successful athletics tradition takes time what you 're seeing is typical growing pains , said patrick nero , commissioner of the america east conference , to which albany , binghamton and stony brook belong he declined to comment on the binghamton investigation , but said of suny s transition to division i , i really do believe that in 10 to 20 years , i think time will show that they will be successful programs the transition to highlevel athletics began in the 1980s , when administrators at buffalo were looking to raise visibility and establish a rallying point for the university , which had a sprawling campus and a large number of commuter students buffalo and the other state universities , which range from 15 , 000 to 30 , 000 students , were large research institutions , yet they competed against small , private colleges suny s 12 smaller fouryear colleges with athletic teams continue to play in division iii at division iii , we were playing institutions that simply were not of our type , recalled william r greiner , who served as buffalo s president from 1991 until 2004 it was simply a peculiarity , our athletics program buffalo entered division i in 1991 and in 1999 moved to the top ncaa division , ia , now known as the football bowl subdivision the same year , stony brook and albany joined division iaa , now known as the football championship subdivision binghamton was the final university to upgrade its program , moving to division i in 2001 unlike the other three universities , it has no football team because universities changed the way they report athletic finances in 2003 , it is difficult to compare spending over time but athletic spending at the four universities has increased over the last few years , according to annual financial data reported to the ncaa binghamton s operating expenses increased 79 percent from 20034 to 20078 , to 1773 million the increase was similar at albany , where expenditures rose to 1334 million from 749 million over the same period stony brook s spending increased 87 percent , to 2207 million from 1180 million and buffalo , which has been in division i the longest , increased spending by 22 percent , to 2185 million from 1786 million while ticket sales , student fees , private donations and other revenues help pay for athletics , the universities' contribution has grown in recent years at albany , the university subsidy to athletics increased 77 percent , to 67 million in 20078 from 38 million in 20034 during the same period , binghamton s contribution rose 47 percent , to 31 million from 21 million buffalo contributed 75 million to athletics in 20078 , a 31 percent increase over 20034 , when it provided 57 million stony brook calculates its contribution differently than the other suny members , but officials said its subsidy totaled 85 million in 20078 , a 119 percent increase over the 39 million contributed in 20034 the large increase was a result of a onetime payment by the university to relieve the athletic department of its debts in 20078 , officials said two of the universities have benefited from connections to powerful state senators in 2002 , stony brook completed construction on a football stadium that is named for state senator kenneth p lavalle , the former chairman of the chamber s higher education committee , who helped procure the 22 million in state money used to build it the events center , an allpurpose arena where the bearcats play basketball , opened in 2004 and cost the state 33 million the financing was secured with the help of a local senator , thomas w libous tangible results of the moves have been hard to quantify applications to albany , which played in the ncaa men s basketball tournament in 2006 and 2007 , have increased by 21 percent since 2006 , but applications to the other three universities also rose during that period at stony brook , jim fiore , the athletic director , said the upgraded sports program contributed to changes that include a 93 percent increase in applications and a jump in test scores of the freshman class since 1999 but some university officials and experts in intercollegiate athletics cautioned against drawing too many conclusions , noting that several factors affect statistics like applications and enrollment at a public university , as families opt for lower tuition in a recession and over the past decade including some commissioned by the ncaa have shown little or no link between investing in bigtime athletics and success in other

sen leahy good morning , everyone judge , it s good to see you back , and your family judge sotomayor , yesterday you answered questions from 11 senators frankly , i feel you demonstrated your commitment to the fair and impartial application of law you certainly demonstrated your composure and patience and your extensive legal knowledge today we 'll have questioning from the remaining eight members of the committee and thenjust to set the scheduleonce we 've finished that questioning , we will arrange a time to go into the traditionalsomething we do every time with a supreme court nominee , the traditional closeddoor session , which is usually not very lengthy , and then go back to others i 've talked with senator sessions we will then go to a second round of questions of no more than 20 minutes each i 've talked with a number of senators that have told me they will not use anywhere near that 20 minutes , although every senator has the right to do it and i would hope we might be able to wrap it up but we 're going to go to senator cornyn , himself a former member of the exas supreme court and former attorney general and senator cornyn , it s yours sen john cornyn \( rtx \) thank you , mr chairman good morning , judge judge sotomayor good morning , senator it s good to see you again sen cornyn good to see you i recall when we met in my office , you told me how much you enjoy the back and forth that lawyers and judges do and i appreciate the good humor and attitude that you brought to this , and i very much appreciate your willingness to serve on the highest court in the land i'm afraid that sometimes in the past these hearings have gotten so downright nasty and contentious that some people are dissuaded from willingness to serve , which i think is a greatis a great tragedy and of course , some have been filibustered they have been denied the opportunity to have an upordown vote on the senate floor i told you when we visited in my office that s not going to happen to you , if i have anything to say about it you will get that upordown vote on the senate floor but i want to ask your assistance this morning to try to help us reconcile two pictures that i think have emerged during the course of this hearing one is , of course , as senator schumer and others have talked about , your lengthy tenure on the federal bench as a trial judge and court of appeals judge and then , there s the other picture that has emerged , from your speeches and your other writings and i need your help trying to reconcile those two pictures , because i think a lot of people have wondered about that and i guess the reason why it s even more important that we understand how you reconcile some of your other writings with your judicial experience and tenure is the fact that , of course , now you will not be a lowercourt judge , subject to the appeals to the supreme court you will be free , as a united states supreme court justice , to basically do what you want , with no court reviewing those decisionsharkening back to the quote we started with during my opening statement about the supreme court being infallible only because it s final so i want just to start with the comments that you made about the wise latina speech , that by my count you made at least five times between 1994 and 2003 you indicated that this was really and please correct me if i'm wrong i'm trying to quote your wordsa , quote , failed rhetorical flourish that fell flat i believe at another time you said they were , quote , words that do n't make sense , close quote and another time , i believe you said it was , quote , a bad idea , close quote am i accurately characterizing your thoughts about the use of thatof that phrase that has been talked about so much \? judge sotomayor yes , generally but the point i was making was that justice o'connor s words , the ones that i was using as a platform to make my point about the value of experience , generally , in the legal systemwas that her words , literally , and mine , literally , made no senseat least , not in the context of what judges do orwhat judges do i did n't and do n't believe that justice o'connor intended to suggest that when two judges disagree one of them has to be unwise and if you read her literal words , that wise old men and wise old womanwomen would come to the same decisions in cases , that s what the words would mean but that s clearly not what she meant and if you listen to my words , it would have the same suggestion that only latinos would come to wiser decisions but that would n't make sense in the context of my speech either , because i pointed out in the speech that eightnine white men had decided brown versus board of education and i noted in a separate paragraph of the speech that no one person speaks in the voice of any group so my rhetorical flourish , just like hers , ca n't be read literally sen cornyn but judge judge sotomayor it had a different meaning in the context of the entire speech sen cornyn but judge , she said a wise man and a wise woman would reach the same conclusion you said that a wise latina woman would reach a better conclusion than a male counterpart what i'm confused aboutare you standing by that statement \? or are you saying that it was a bad idea , and youare you disavowing that statement \? judge sotomayor it is clear from the attention that my words have gotten and the manner in which it has been understood by some people that my words failed they did n't work the message that the entire speech attempted to deliver , however , remains the message that i think justice o'connor meant , the message that higher nominees including justice alito meant when he said that his italian ancestry he considers when he s deciding discrimination cases i do n't think he meant , i do n't think justice o'connor meant , that personal experiences compel results in any way i think life experiences generally , whether it s that i'm a latina or was a state prosecutor or have been a commercial litigator or been a trial judge and an appellate judge , that the mixture of allof all of those things , the amalgam of them , help me to listen and understand but all of us understand , because that s the kind of judges we have proven yourself to be , we rely on the law to command the results in the case so when one talks about life experiences , and even in the context of my speech , my message was different than i understand my words have been understood by some sen cornyn so you 'ddo you stand by your words of yesterday inwhen you said it was a failed rhetorical flourish that fell flat , that they are words that do n't make sense , and that they 're a bad idea \? judge sotomayor i stand by the words it fell flat and itand i understand that some people have understood them in a way that i never intended and i would hope that , in the context of the speech , that they would be understood sen cornyn well , you spoke about the law students to whom these comments were frequently directed and your desire to inspire them if in fact the message that they heard was that the quality of justice depends on the sex , race or ethnicity of the judge , is that a understanding that you would regret \? judge sotomayor i would regret that , because , for me , the work i do with studentsand it s just not in the context of those six speeches as you know , i give dozens more speeches to students all the time , and to lawyers of all backgrounds and i giveand have spoken to community groups of all type and what i do in each of those situations is to encourage both students and , as i did when i spoke to new immigrants that i was admitting as students , to try to encourage them to participate on all levels of our society i tell people that that s one of the great things about america , that we can do so many different things and participate so fully in all of the opportunities america presents it s a message that i deliver repeatedly , and as the context of all of my speeches is , i 've made it so can you work hard at it pay attention to what you 're doing , and participate sen cornyn let me ask about another speech you gave in 1996 that was published in the suffolk university law review , where you wrote what appears to be an endorsement of the idea that judges should change the law you wrote , quote , change , sometimes radical change , can and does occur in a legal system that serves a society whose social policy itself changes you noted with apparent approval that , quote , a given judge or judges may develop a novel approach to a specific set of facts or legal framework that pushes the law in a new direction , close quote can you explain what you meant by those words \? judge sotomayor the title of that speech was returning majesty to the law as i hope i communicated in my opening remarks , i'm passionate about the practice of law and judging , passionate in sense of respecting the rule of law so much the speech was given in the context of talking to young lawyers and saying do n't participate in the cynicism that people express about our legal system i sen cornyn what kind ofexcuse me i'm sorry i did n't mean to interrupt you judge sotomayor and i was encouraging them not to fall into the trap of calling decisions that the public disagrees with , as they sometimes do , activism , or using other labels , but to try to be more engaged in explaining the law and the process of law to the public and in the context of the words that you quoted to me , i pointed out to them explicitly , about evolving social changes , that what was i referring to is , congress is passing new laws all the time , and so whatever was viewed as settled law previously will often get changed because congress has changed something i also spoke about the fact that society evolves in terms of technology and other developments , and so the law is being applied to a new set of facts in terms of talking about different approaches in law , i was talking about the fact that there are some cases that are viewed as radicaland i think i mentioned just one case , brown versus board of educationand explaining and encouraging them to explain that process too and there are new directions in the law in terms of the court the courtsupreme court is often looking at its precedents and considering whether in certain circumstances the president is owed deference for very important reasons , but the court takes a new direction and those new directions rarely if ever come at the initiation of the court they come because lawyers are encouraging the court to look at a situation in a new way , to consider it in a different way what i was telling those young lawyers is , do n't play into people s skepticism about the law look to explain to them the process i also , when i was talking about returning majesty to the law , i spoke to them about what judges can do and i talked about , in the second half of that speech , that we had an obligation to ensure that we were monitoring the behavior of lawyers before us , so that when questionable ethical or other conduct could bring disrepute to the legal system , that we monitor our lawyers , because that would return sen cornyn judge , if you let mei think we 're straying away from the question i had talking about oversight of lawyers would you explain how , when you say judges shouldor i'm sorry , let me just ask do you believe that judges ever change the law \? i take it from your statement that you do judge sotomayor they changewe ca n't change law we 're not lawmakers but we change our view of how to interpret certain laws based on new facts , new developments of doctrinal theory , considerations of whetherwhat the reliance of society may be in an old rule we think about whether a rule of law has proven workable we look at how often the court has affirmed a prior understanding of how to approach an issue but in those senses there s changes by judges in the popular perception that we 're changing the law sen cornyn in another speech in 1996 , you celebrated the uncertainty of the law you wrote that the law is always in a , quote , necessary state of flux , close quote you wrote that the law judges declare is not , quote , a definitive , capital l law that would makethat many would like to think exist , close quote and , quote , that the public fails to appreciate the importance of the indefiniteness in the law can you explain those statements \? and why do you think indefiniteness is so important to the law \? judge sotomayor it s not that it s important to the law as much as it is that it s what legal cases are about people bring cases to courts because they believe that precedents do n't clearly answer the fact situation that they 're presenting in their individual case that creates uncertainty that s why people bring cases and they say , look , the law says this , but i'm entitled to that i have this set of facts that entitle me to relief under the law it s the entire process of law if law was always clear , we would n't have judges it s because there is indefiniteness , not in what the law is , but its application to new facts , that people sometimes feel it s unpredictable that speech , as others i 've given , is an attempt to encourage judges to explain to the public more of the process the role of judges is to ensure that they are applying the law to those new facts that they 're interpreting that law with congress' intent , being informed by what precedents say about the law and congress' intent and applying it to the new facts but that s what the role of the courts is and obviously , the public is going to become impatient with that , if they do n't understand that process and i'm encouraging lawyers to do more work in explaining the system , in explaining what we are doing as courts sen cornyn in a 2001 speech at berkeley , you wrote , quote , whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences , a possibility i abhor less or discount less than my colleague judge cedarbaum , our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging , close quote the differencea difference is physiological if it relates to the mechanical , physical , or biochemical functions of the body , as i understand the word what do you mean by that \? judge sotomayor i was talking just about that there are in the lawthere have been upheld in certain situations that certain job positions have a requirement for a certain amount of strength or other characteristics that maybe thea person who fits that characteristics and have that job but there are differences that may affect a particular type of work we do that all the time sen cornyn we 're talking about judging , though , are n't judge sotomayor you need to be a pilot who has good eyesight sen cornyn we 're not talking about pilots we 're talking about judging , right \? judge sotomayor no , no , no , no but what i'mwas talking about there , because the context of that was talking about the difference in the process of judging , and the process of judging , for me , is what life experiences brings to the process it helps you listen and understand it does n't change what the law is or what the law commands a life experience as a prosecutor may help me listen and understand an argument in a criminal case it may have no relevancy to what happens in an antitrust suit it s just a question of the process of judging it improves both the public s confidence that there are judges from a variety of different backgrounds on the bench , because they feel that all issues will be morebetter at least addressed , not that it s better addressed , but that it helps that process of feeling confidence that all arguments are going to be listened to and understand sen cornyn so you stand by the comment thator the statement that inherent physiological differences will make a difference in judging judge sotomayor i'm not sure of thati'm not sure exactly where that could play out , but i was asking a hypothetical question in that paragraph i was saying , look , we just do n't know if you read the entire part of that speech , what i was saying is , let s ask the question that s what all of these studies are doing ask the question if there s a difference ignoring things and saying , you know , it does n't happen is n't an answer to situation it s consider it , consider it as a possibility , and think about it but i certainly was n't intending to suggest that there would be a difference that affected the outcome i talked about there being a possibility that it could affect the process of judging sen cornyn as you can tell , i'm struggling a little bit to understand how your statement about physiological differences could affect the outcome or ffect judging , and your stated commitment to fidelity to the law as being your sole standard , and how any litigant can know where that will end but let me ask you , on another topic , there was a washington post story on may the 29th , 2009 , wherethat starts out saying , the white house scrambled yesterday to assuage worries from liberal groups about judge sotomayor s scant record on abortion rights and the white house saidit goes on to say , white house press secretary said the president did not ask sotomayor specifically about abortion rights during their interview is that correct \? judge sotomayor yes it is absolutely correct i was asked no question by anyone , including the president , about my views on any specific legal issue sen cornyn do you know , then , on what basis , if that s the caseand i accept your statementon what basis that the white house officials would subsequently send a message that abortionrights groups do not need to worry about how you might rule in a challenge to roe versus wade \? judge sotomayor no , sir , because you just have to look at my record to now that in the cases that i addressed on all issues , i follow the law sen cornyn on what basis would george pavia , who was apparently senior partner in the law firm that hired you as a corporate litigatoron what basis would he say that he thinks support of abortion rights would be in line with your generally liberal instincts \? he s quoted in this article saying , quote , i can guarantee she 'll be for abortion rights , close quote on what basis would mr pavia say that , if you know \? judge sotomayor i have no idea , since i know for a fact i never spoke to him about my views on abortionfrankly , on my views on any social issue george was thewas the head partner of my firm , but our contact was not on a daily basis i have no idea why he s drawing that conclusion , because if he looked at my record , i have ruled according to the law in all cases addressed to the issue of the termination of abortion rights , of women s right to terminate their pregnancy and i 've voted in cases in which i 've upheld the application of the mexico city policy , which was a policy in which the government was not funding certain sen cornyn right do you agree with judge sotomayor abortionrelated activities sen cornyn do you agree with his statement that you have generally liberal instincts \? judge sotomayor if he was talking about the fact that i served on a particular board that promoted equal opportunity for people , the puerto rican legal defense and education fund , then you could talk about that being a liberal instinct in the sense that i promote equal opportunity in america and the attempts to ensure that but he has not read my jurisprudence for 17 years , i can assure you he s a corporate litigator and my experience with corporate litigators is that they only look at the law when it affects the case before them sen cornyn \( laughs \) judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen cornyn well , i hope , as you suggested , not only liberals endorse the idea of equal opportunity in this country that s athat s a , i think , bedrock doctrine that undergirds all of our all of our law but that brings me , in the short time i have left , to the new haven firefighter case as you know , there are a number of the new haven firefighters who are here today and will testify tomorrow and i have to tell you , your honor , as aas a former judge myself , i was shocked to see that the sort of treatment that the threejudge panel you served on gave to the claims of these firefighters by a \( n \) unpublished summary order , which has been pointed out in the press , willwould not likely to be reviewed or even caught by other judges on the 2nd circuit except for the fact that judge cabranes read about a comment made by the lawyer representing the firefighters in the press , that the court gave short shrift to the claims of the firefighters judge cabranes said that core issue presented by this case , the scope of a municipal employer s authority to disregard examination results based solely on the successful applicant , is not addressed by any precedent of the supreme court or our circuit and looking at thelooking at the unpublished summary order , this threejudge panel of the 2nd circuit does n't cite any legal authority whatsoever to support its conclusion can you explain to me whywhy you would deal with it in a way that appears to be sowell , dismissive may be too strong a wordbut avoid the very important claims that the supreme court ultimately reversed you on that were raised by the firefighters' appeal \? judge sotomayor senator , i ca n't speak to what brought this case to judge cabranes s attention i can say the following , however when parties are dissatisfied with a panel decision , they can file a petition for rehearing en banc and in fact , that s what happened in the ricci case those briefs are routinely reviewed by judges and so publishing by summary orderor addressing an issue by summary order or by published opinion does n't hide a party s claims from other judges they get the petitions for rehearing similarly , parties , when they 're dissatisfied with what a circuit has done , file petitions for certiorari , which is a request for the supreme court to review a case and so the court looks at that as well and so , regardless of how a circuit decided a case , it s not a question of hiding it from others with respect to the broader question that you 're raising , which is , why do you do it by summary order or why do you do it in a published opinion or in a per curiam , the questionor the practice is that about 75 percent of circuit court decisions are decided by summary order , in part because we ca n't handle the volume of our work if we were writing long decisions in every case but more importantly , because not every case requires a long opinion if a district court opinion has been clear and thorough on an issue and in this case , there was a 78page decision by the district court it adequately explained the question that the supreme court addressed and reviewed and so to the extent that a particular panel considers that an issue has been decided by existing precedent , that s a question that the court above can obviously revisit , as it did in ricci , where it looked at it and said , well , we understand what the circuit did , we understand what existing law is , but we should be looking at this question in a new way that s the job of the supreme court i would sen cornyn but judge , even the district court admitted that a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because they knew that the examsthey knew that were the exams certified , the mayor would incur the wrath of reverend boise kimber and other influential leaders of new haven s africanamerican community so you decided that based on their claim of potential disparate impact liability , that there was no recoursethat the city was justified in disregarding the exams , and thus denying these firefighters , many of whom suffered hardship in order to study and to prepare for these examinations , and were successful , only to see that hard work and effort disregarded and not even acknowledged in the court s opinion and ultimately , as you know , the supreme court said that you just ca n't claim potential disparate impact liability as a city and then deny someone a promotion based on the color of their skin there has to be a strong basis in evidence but you did n't look to see whether there was a basis in evidence to the city s claim your summary opinionunpublished summary order did n't even discuss that do n't you think that these firefighters and other litigants deserve a more detailed analysis of their claims and an explanation for why you ultimately deny their claim \? judge sotomayor as you know , the court s opinion , issued after discussions en banc , recognized , as i do , the hardship that thefirefighters experience that s not been naysaid by anyone theissue before the court was a different one and the one that thedistrict court addressed was what decision the decision makers made not what people behind the scenes wanted the decision makers to make , but what they were considering and what they were considering was the state of the law at the time and in an attempt to comply with what they believe the law said and what the panel recognized as whatthe 2nd circuit precedent said , that they made a choice under thatexisting law the supreme court in its decision set a new standard by which an employer and lower court should review what the employer is doing , by the substantial evidence test that test was not discussed with the panel it was n't part of the arguments below that was a decision by the court , borrowing from other areas of the law and saying we think this would work better in this situation sen cornyn my time s up thank you sen leahy thank you thank you very much i would note in the recordwill put in the record a letter of support for judge sotomayor s nomination from the united states hispanic chamber of commerce on behalf of its 3 million hispanicowned business members , 60 undersigned organizations , including the el paso hispanic chamber of commerce , the greater dallas hispanic chamber of commerce , the houston hispanic chamber of commerce , the odessa hispanic chamber of commerce and a similar letter from the arizona hispanic chamber of commerce i 'd meant to put those in the record before we 'll put them in the record now sen sessions mr chairman \? sen leahy yes sen sessions i would offer a letter for the record from the national rifle association in which they express serious concern about the nomination of judge sonia sotomayor also , i noticed that the head of that organization , mr lapierre , wrote an article this morning raising increased concern after yesterday s testimony and i would also offer for the record a letter from mr richard land , the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention , also raising concerns sen leahy toand without objection , those will be made part of the record and we 'lldo you have anything else \? sen sessions nothing else sen leahy then i 'll yield to senator cardin sen benjamin l cardin \( dmd \) thank you , mr chairman and judge sotomayor , good morning welcome back to our committee i just want you to know that the baseball fans of baltimore knew there was a judge somewhere that changed in a very favorable way the reputation of baltimore forever you are a hero they now know it s judge sotomayor you 're a hero to the baltimore baseball fans let me explain the major league baseball strike , you allowed the season to continue so cal ripken could become the iron man of baseball in september 1995 judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen cardin so we just want to invite you , as a baseball fan , we want to invite you to an orioles game , and we promise it will not be when the yankees are playing , so that you can root for the baltimore orioles \( laughter \) judge sotomayor that s a great invitation , and good morning , senator you can assure your baltimore fans that i have been to camden yards it s a beautiful stadium sen cardin well , we think it s the best of course , it was the beginning of the new trends of baseball stadiums and you 're certainly welcome before this hearing , the people of this country knew that the president had selected someone with incredible credentials to be the supreme court member now , they know the person is able and is capable and understands the law and has been able to understand what the appropriate role is for a judge in interpreting the law and has done very well in responding to the members of the united states senate , which i thinksbodes well for your interaction with attorneys and your colleagues on the bench in having a thorough discussion of the very important issues that will affect the lives of all people in our nation i do want to first start with the judicial temperament issue and the reference to the almanac on the federal judiciary i just really want to quote from other statements that were included in that almanac , where they were commenting about you and saying that she is very good she is bright she s a good judge she is very smart she is frighteningly smart she is intellectually tough she is very intelligent she has a very good commonsense approach to the law she looks at the practical issues she is good she s an exceptional judge overall she s engaged in oral argument she is well prepared she participates actively in oral argument she is extremely hardworking and well prepared and i want to quote from one of the judges on your circuit , judge miner , who was appointed by president reagan , when he said , i do n't think i 'd go as far as to classify her in one camp or another i think she just deserves the classification of an \( sic \) outstanding judge i say that because maybe you would like to comment to these more favorable comments \( laughter \) about how the bar feels about your service on the bench judge sotomayor ithank those who have commented in the way they did i think that most lawyers who participate in argument before me know how engaged i become in their arguments and trying to understand them and as i indicated yesterday , that can appear tough to some people , because active engagement can sometimes feel that way but my style is to engage as much as i can so i can ensure myself that i understand what a party s intending to tell me i am , in terms of what i do , always interested in understanding , and so that will make me an active participant in argument as i noted yesterday , i have colleagues who never ask questions there are some judges on the supreme court who rarely ask questions , and others ask a lot of questions judges approach issues in different ways , with different styles , and mine happens to be on one end of the style , and others choose others sen cardin well , i thank you for that response i agree with you that the constitution , the bill of rights , are timeless documents , and have served our nation well for over 200 years , and the envy of many other nations now , there are many protections in the constitution , but i would like to talk a little bit about thecivil rights and the basic protections in our constitution , and how we 've seen a progression from the constitution , bill of rights , to constitutional amendments , including the 13th , 14th , 15th and 19th through congressional action through the passage of such bills as the civil rights act of 1964 , the voting rights act of 1965 supreme court decisions , that we 've talked about , that have changed civil rights in america , made it possible for many people to have the opportunities of this country that otherwise would have been denied and we 've made a lot of progress since the days of segregated schools and restrictions on people s opportunities to vote , but i think we 'd all do well to remember the advice given to us by our colleague senator edward kennedy , the former chairman of this committee , as he talks about the civil rights struggle , when he says , and i quote , the work goes on , the cause endures , the hope still lives , and the dream shall never die so i say that as an introduction to one area of civil rights , and that is the right of vote , a fundamental right my own experience in 2006 that s just a few years agocauses me to have concerns in my own election , i found that there were lines longer in the africanamerican precincts to vote than in other precincts and it was curious as to why this took place they did n't have as many voting machines there was a lot of irregularities and it caused a lot of people who had to get back to work to be denied their right to participate we also found on election day fraudulent sample voteballots that were targeted to minority voters in an effort to diminish their importance in the election i mention that because that happened not 50 years ago , but happened just a few years ago congress renewed the voting rights act by rather large votes 93to0 in the united states senate , 390to33 in the house of representatives there s clear intent of congress to continue to protect voters in this country in the northwest austin municipal utility district number one versus holder , one justice on the court , in dictum , challenged congress s authority to extend the civil rights case now , i say that knowing your view about giving due deference to congress , particularly as it relates to expanding and extending civil rights protections so my question to you is , tell me a little bit about your passion for protecting the right of vote , to make sure that the laws are enforced as congress intended to guarantee to every american the right to participate at the voting place judge sotomayor when we speak about my passion , i do n't think that the issue of guaranteeing each citizen the right to vote is unique to me or that it s different among any senator or among any group of people who are americans it is a fundamental right and it is one that you 've recognized congress has addressed for decades and has done an amazing job in passing a wide variety of statutes in an effort to protect that right the question that a court would face in any individual situation is whether an act of congress conflicts with some right of either the state or an individual with respect to the issue of voting there could be other challenges raised on a wide variety of different basises \( sic \) , but each case would present its own unique circumstance there is one case involving the voting rights act where i addressed the issue of the right to vote and in that case , i issued a dissent on an en banc ruling by my courtfor the public who may not understand what en banc ruling means , when the whole court is considering an issuein that case , if it was n't 13 , it may have been 12 members of the court we 're complement of 13 judges , but i right now ca n't remember if were a full complement at the time considering an issuethe majority upheld a state regulation barring a group of people from voting i dissented , on a very short opinion , oneparagraph opinion , saying these are the words of congress in the statute it passed and the words are that no state may impose aand i'm paraphrasing it now i'm not trying to read the statutebut no condition or restriction on voting that denies or abridges the right to vote on the basis of race i noted that , given the procedural posture of that case , that the plaintiff had alleged that that s exactly what the state was doing , and i said that s the allegation on the complaint that s what a judge has to accept on the face of the complaint we got to give him a chance to prove that and that , to me , was the end of the story to the extent that the majority believed that there was a lot of discussion among the variety of different opinions in the case as to whether this individual could or could not prove his allegation , and there was a suggestion by both sides that he might never be able to do it , my point was a legal one these are congress s words we have to take them at their word and if there s an end result of this process that we do n't like , then we have to leave that to congress to address that issue we ca n't fix it by ruling against what i viewed as the express words of congress sen cardin let me use your quote there because i thought it was particularly appropriate you said , i trust that congress would prefer to make needed changes itself rather than to have the courts to do so for it and i think the members of this committee would would agree with you and , as you responded to senator grassley in regards to the riverkeeper case , you said you give deference to congress i think we all share that one of my concerns is that we are seeing judicial activism in restricting the clear intent of congress in moving forward on fundamental protections and let me move , i might , to the environment , which is an area that is of great concern to all of us in the past 50 years , congress has passed important environmental laws , including the clean air act , the clean water act , the national environmental policy act , the endangered species act , the safe drinking water act and superfund despite the progress we 've made over the years , it s important that we keep advancing the protections in our environment during your testimony yesterday , you made it clear that you understand that senators and members of congress elected by the people are the ones making policy by passing laws and you also made it clear that judges apply the laws enacted andand that they should do soat least they should do so with deference to the intent of congress yet we 've seen in recent decisions of the supreme court , like the solid waste agency of northern cook county v us corps of engineers and rapanos v united states , that they have forced the epa to drop more than 500 cases against alleged polluters thesethese decisions have impact and it is clear to many of us that they reject longstanding legal interpretations in the federal clean water act that was done by the supreme court , and ignoring the science that served as the foundations for the laws passed by congress and the intent of congress to protect american people by providing them with clean water , clean air and a healthy environment as a senator from maryland , i'm particularly concerned about that as it relates to the efforts that we 're making on the chesapeake bay now , i understand that these decisions are now precedent and they are binding , and that it may very well require the congress to pass laws further clarifying what we meant to say so that we can try to get us back on track i understand that but i would like you to comment and , i hope , reinforce the point that you have said that in reaching decisions that come to the bench , whether they 're environmental laws or other laws that protect our society , you will follow the intent of congress and will not try to supplant individual judgment that would restrict the protections that congress has passed for our community judge sotomayor believe my casemy cases , my entire record shows that i look at the acts of congress , as i think the supreme court does , with deference , because that is the bedrock of our constitutional system , which is that each branch has a different set of constitutional powers that deference must be given to the rights of each branch in each situationthat is , its exercising its powers and , to the extent that the court has a rolebecause it does have a roleto ensuring that the constitution is followed , it attempts to do that when i say attemptbut it always attempts it with a recognition of the deference it owes to the elected branches in terms of setting policy and making law sen cardin thank you for that response let me turn , if i might , to our personal backgrounds there s been a lot of discussion here about what each of us bring to our position in public life progress for women in this country has not come easily or quickly at one time , women could not vote , could not serve on juries , could not hold property i sit here today wanting to feel confident that the supreme court and its justices will make key decisions on women s rights , and society will act to ensure continued progress for equality with men and women now , we all agree that in rendering an individual decision , a gender or ethnic background should not affect your judgment there is an importance to diversity , which i think we 've all talked about each of us bring our life experiences to our job your life experience at princeton , i think , serves as an example you attended the school that f scott fitzgerald 90 yearscalled the pleasantest country club in america , with very restrictive policies as to who could attend princeton university by 1972 , your freshman class , it was a different place , but still far from where it should be youand i admire your efforts to change that at princeton and you were actively involved in improving diversity at that school and princeton s a better place today because of your efforts i think of my own experiences at law school , university of maryland law school , which denied admission to thurgood marshall , and in my class had very few women times have changed justice ginsburg said , referring to the importance of women on the bench , says , i think the presence of women on the bench made it possible for the courts to appreciate earlier than they might otherwise that sexual harassment belongs under title vii so on behalf of myself , on behalf of my daughter and two granddaughters , i want to hear from you the importance of different voices in our schools , in our congress and on the supreme court of the united states as to how having diversity , the importance of diversity your views as to what steps are appropriate for government to take in helping to improve diversity judge sotomayor your comment about your daughter and granddaughter makes me remember a letter i received when i was being nominated to the circuit court it was from a woman who said she had 19 daughters and grandchildren , and how much pride she took in knowing that a woman could serve on a court like the 2nd circuit and i realized then how important the diversity of the bench is to making people feel and understand the great opportunity america provides to all its citizens and that has value that s clear with respect to the issue of the question of what role diversity serves in the society , it hearkens back almost directly to your previous question i 've been overusing that word hearkens sorry sen cornyn \( chuckles \) judge sotomayor it almost comes around to your earlier question , which is , that issue is one that starts with the legislative branches in the government , its executive bodies , and employers who look at their workforce , that look at the opportunities in society and make policy decisions about what promotes that equal opportunity in the first instance the court then looks at what they have done and determines whether that action is constitutional or not and with respect at least to the education field , in a very recent set of cases , the supreme court looked at the role of diversity in educational decisions , as to which students they would admit , and the court upheld the university of michigan s law school admissions policy , which because the school believed that it needed to promote as wide a body and diverse a body of students to ensure that life perspectives , that the experience of students , would be as fulsome as they wished and they used race there as one of many factors , but not one that compelled the individual choices of student the court upheld that and justice o'connor , in the opinion she wroteauthored expressed the hope that in 25 years race would n't even need to be considered in a separate case , the university of michigan s undergraduate admissions policy , the court struck that down and it struck it down because it viewed the use of race as a form of impermissible quota , because it was n't based on an individual assessment of the people applying , but as an impermissible violation of the equal protection clause and of the law these situations are always looked at individually and , as i said , in the context of the choices that congress , the executive branch , an employer is making , and the interests that it s asserting , and the remedy that it s creating to address the interests it s trying to protect all of that is an individual question for the courts sen cardin welland you need to look at all the facts in reaching those decisions , which you have stressed over and over again i want a justice who will continue to move the court forward in protecting those important civil rights i want a justice who will fight for people like lawrence king , who at the age of 15 was shot in the school because he was openly gay i want a justice who will fight for women , like a 28yearold californian who was gangraped by four people because she was a lesbian and i want the justice who will fight for people like james byrd , who was beaten and dragged by a truck for two miles because he was black so we need to continue that focus and you talked about race , and i think about the gant case that you ruled in , a 6yearold black child who was removed from school and was treated rather harshly , with racial harassment and in your dissent you stated that treatment this lone black child encountered during his \( brief \? \) time in cook s hill s \( sic \) first grade to have been not merely arguable unusual indisputable discretion \( sic \) but unprecedented and contrary to the school s established policy justice blackmun spoke in order to get beyond race , we first must take race inaccount of race and if you ignore race completely , are n't you ignoring facts that are important in a particular case \? judge sotomayor well , it depends on the context of that case that you 're looking at in the gant case , for example , there were a variety of different challenges brought by the plaintiff to the conduct that was alleged the school had engaged in i joined the majority in dismissing some of the claims as not consistent with law but in that case , there was a disparate treatment element , and i pointed out to the set of facts that showed or presented evidence of that disparate treatment that s the quote that you were reading from , that this was a sole child who was treated completely different than other children of a different race in the services that he was provided with and in the opportunities he was given to remedy or to receive remedial help that is obviously different , because what you 're looking at is the law as it exists , and the promise that the law makes to every citizen of equal treatment in that situation sen cardin welland i agree i think you need to take a look at all the facts and the circumstances and you ignore race , you 're ignoring an important point of the facts let me talk a little bit about privacy , if i might justice brandeis describes privacy as the right to be left alone in other words , if we must restrict this right , it must be minimal , and protections must occur before any such action occurs the supreme court has advanced rights of privacy in the myers \( sp \) case the loving case , which established the fundamental of persons to raise families and to marry whom they pleased , regardless of race the lawrence case that states could not criminalize homosexual conduct griswold , that allowed for family planning as a fundamental right and of course roe v wade , which gave women the right to control their own bodies i just would like to get your assessment of the role the court faces on privacy issues in the 21st century , recognizing that our constitution was written in the 18th century and the challenges today are far different than they were when the constitution was written , as it relates to privacy the technologies are different today , and the circumstances of life are different how do you see privacy challenges being confronted in the 21st century in our constitution and in the courts \? judge sotomayor the right to privacy has been recognized , as you know , in a wide variety of circumstances for more than probably 90 years now , close to a hundred , that is thepart of the courts' precedents in applying the immutable principles of the constitution , the liberty provision of the dueprocess clause , and recognizing that that provides a right to privacy in a variety of different settings you 've mentioned that line of cases , and there are many others in which the court has recognized that as a right in terms of the coming century , it s guided by those cases , because those cases provide the court s precedents in frameworkand with other casesto look at how we will consider a new challenge to a new law or to a new situation that s what precedents do they provide a framework constitution remains the same society changes the situations it brings before courts change but the principles are inare the words of the constitution , guided by how precedent gives or has applied those principles to each situation and then you take that and you look at the new situation sen cardin thankin the time that i have remaining , i would like to talk about pro bono i enjoyed our conversation when we when you were in my office talking about your commitment to pro bono i think , as attorneys , we all have a special responsibility for equal justice and that requires equal access it s not just those who can afford a lawyer thelegalaid lawyers per capita are about 60 one per 6 , 800 for private attorneys , it s one per 525 this is not equal justice under the law as promised by the etching on the entrance to the united states supreme court now , it makes a difference if you have a lawyer if you have a lawyer , you 're more likely to be able to save your home , to get the health care that you need , to be able to deal with consumer problems and i had the honor of chairing the maryland legal services corporation i chaired a commission that looked into legal services in maryland i'm proud of the fact that we helped establish that university of maryland law school and university of baltimore law school required clinical experiences for our law students so they not only get the experience of handling a case but understand the need to deal with people who otherwise could not afford an attorney congress needs to do more in this area there is no question about that and i'm hopeful that we will reauthorize the legal service act and provide additional resources but i would like to get your view as to what is the individual responsibility of a lawyer for equal justice under the law , including pro bono , and how you see the role of the courts in helping to establish the efforts among the legal community to carry out our responsibility judge sotomayor i know that there s been a lot of attention paid to one speech and its variants that i 've given if you look at the body of my speeches , public service and pro bono work is probably the main topic i speak ati speak about virtually every graduation speech i give to law students , speeches i 've given to new immigrants being sworn in as citizens , to community groups of all type , is the importance of participation in bettering the conditions of our society , active involvement in our communities and it does n't have to be active involvement inin politics i tell people that just get involved in your community work on your school boards work in your churches work in your community to improve it the issue of public service is a requirement under the code of the american bar association virtually every state has a requirement that lawyers participate in public service in some way i 've given multiple speeches in which i 've talked to law school bodies and said make sure your students do n't leave your school without understanding the critical importance of public service in what they do as lawyers in that we are in full agreement , senator to me , that s a core responsibility of lawyering our founding fathers , they became what they becameour founding fathersbecause of their fundamental belief of involvement in their society in public service and it s a to me a spirit that is the charge of the legal profession because that s what we do we help peoplein a different way than doctors do , but helping people receive justice under the law is a critical importance of our work sen cardin well , very , very well said i look forward to working between congress and the courts in advancing a strategy thank you , mr chairman sen leahy thank you very much , senator cardin and senator coburn sen tom coburn \( rok \) thank you , mr chairman i 'd like to ask unanimous consent to put in an article from the newspaper this morning , in the washington times sen leahy without objection , it will be placed in the record sen coburn welcome , again andbut first of all , let me apologize to you because i was not able to hearalthough i got to read some of your testimony yesterday we have a schedule that says we must finish health care within a certain time whether we get it right or wrong , we 've got to get it done in a certain time and so i was involved with that , and i apologize number two is , i apologize to you for the outbursts that have occurred in this committee anybody who values life like i do and who s prolife recognizes that the way you change minds is not yell at people , is you love them , and you care about their concerns and you \( word inaudible \) them to a level of understanding , not condemnation and so for that , i apologize i admire your composure and i thank the chairman and the ranking member for the way they handled that as well i want to spend a few moments with you , but i kind of want to change the tone here a little bit in terms of what we talk about a lot of americans are watching this hearing and when i get together with a couple of doctors , they do n't understand half of what i say and when two lawyers talk , most of us who are n't lawyers , like i'm not , have trouble following so i want us to use words that the american people can truly understand as i both ask you questions and as you answer them i will try to do that , and i hope that you will , as well , because i think it benefits our country to do that you 've been asked a lot of questions about abortion and you 've said that roe v wade is settled law where are we today \? what is the settled law in america about abortion \? judge sotomayor i can speak to what the court has said in its precedent in planned parenthood versus casey , the court reaffirmed the core holding of roe versus wade , that a woman has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy in certain circumstances in casey , the court announced that in reviewing state regulations that may apply to that right , that the court considers whether that regulation has an undue burden on the woman s constitutional right that s my understanding of what the state of the law is sen coburn so let me give you a couple of cases let s say i'm 38 weeks pregnant and we discover a small spina bifida sac on the lower sacrum , the lower part of the back , on my baby , and i feel like i just ca n't handle a child with that would it be legal in this country to terminate that child s life \? judge sotomayor i ca n't answer that question in the abstract , because i would have to look at what the state of the state s law was on that question and what the state said with respect to that issue i can say that the question of the number of weeks that a woman is pregnant has beenthat approach to looking at a woman s act has was changed by casey the question is , is the state regulation regulating what a woman does an undue burden \? and so i ca n't answer your hypothetical , because i ca n't look at it as an abstract without knowing what state laws exist on this issue or not and even if i knew that , i probably could n't opine , because i'm sure that situation might well arise before the court sen coburn okay well , does technologyin terms of the advancement of technology , should it have any bearing whatsoever on the way we look at roe v wade \? for example , published reports , most recently of a 21week 21weekthat s 142 daysfetus alive and well now at 9 months of age with no apparent complications because the technology has advanced so far that we can now save children who are born prematurely at that levelshould that have any bearing as we look at the law \? judge sotomayor the law has answered a different question it s talked about the constitutional right of women sen coburn i understand judge sotomayor in certain circumstances and , as i indicated , the issue becomes one of what s the state regulation in any particular circumstance sen coburn i understand but all i'm asking is , should it have any bearing \? judge sotomayor i ca n't answer that in the abstract , because the question as it would come before me would n't be inanin the way that you form it as a citizen it would come to me as a judge in the context of some action that someone s taking , whetherif it s the state , the state if it s a private citizen being controlled by the state , challenging that actionthose issues are sen coburn but viability is a portion of a lot of that and a lot of the decisionhave been made basis \( sic \) on viability if we now have viability at 21 weeks , why would that not be something that should be considered as we look at the status of what can and cannot happen in terms of this right to privacy that s been granted under roe v wade and casey \? judge sotomayor all i can say to you is what the court s done sen coburn right judge sotomayor and the standard that the court has applied , what factors it may or may not look at within a particular factual situation , ca n't be predicted in a way to say , yes , absolutely , that s going to be considered , no , this wo n't be considered sen coburn all i'm asking is whether it should judge sotomayor that sen coburn should viability , should technology , at any time , be considered as we discuss these very delicate issues that have such an impact on so many people \? and your answer is that you ca n't answer it judge sotomayor i ca n't because that s not a question that the court reaches out to answer sen coburn well judge sotomayor that s a question that gets created by a state regulation of some sort or an action by the state that may or may not , according to some claimant , place an undue burden on her we do n't make policy choices in the court we look at the case before us with the interests that are argued by the parties , look at our precedent , and try to apply its principles to the arguments parties are raising sen coburn i'm reminded of one of your quotes that says you do make policy and i wo n't continue that ii'm concerned , and i think many others aredoes a state legislature have the right under the constitution to determine what is death \? have we statutorily definedand we have in 50 states and most of the territorieswhat is the definition of death \? you think that s within the realm of the constitution that states can do that \? judge sotomayor it depends on what they 're applying that definition to and so there are situations in which they might and situations where that definition would or would not have applicability to the dispute before the court all state action is looked at within the context of what the state is attempting to do and what liabilities it s imposing sen coburn but you would not deny the fact that states do have the right to set up statutes that define , to give guidance to their citizens what constitutes death \? judge sotomayor as i said , it depends on in what context they 're attempting to do that sen coburn they 're doing it so they limit the liability of others with regard to that decision , which would inherently be the right of the state legislature , as i read the constitution you may have a different response to that andwhich bring me back to the technology again as recently as six months ago , we now record fetal heartbeats at 14 days postconception we record fetal brainwaves at 39 days postconception and i do n't expect you to answer this , but i do expect you to pay attention to it as you contemplate these big issuesis we have this schizophrenic rule of the law where we have defined death as the absence of those , but we refuse to define life as the presence of those and all of us are dependent at different levels on other people during all stages of our development from the very early in the womb , outside of the womb , to the very late and it concerns me that we are so inaccurateor inaccurate s an improper term inconsistent in terms of our application of logic you said that roe v wade is settled law yesterday andand and i believe it s settled under the basis of the right to privacy , which has been there so the question i 'd like to turn to next is , in your ruling , the 2nd circuit ruling onand i'm trying to remember the name of the casemaloneythe position was is that there s not an individual fundamental right to bear arms in this country is thatis that a correct understanding of that \? judge sotomayor no , sir sen coburn okay please educate me , if you would judge sotomayor in the supreme court s decision in heller , it recognized an individual right to bear arms as a right guaranteed by the second amendment , an important right , and one that limited the actions a federalthe federal government could take with respect to the possession of firearms and in that case we 're talking about handguns the maloney case presented a different question , and that was whether that individual right would limit the activities that states could do to regulate the possession of firearms that question is addressed by a legal doctrine that legal doctrine uses the word fundamental , but it does n't have the same meaning that common people understand that word to mean to most people , the word , by its dictionary term , is critically important , central fundamental it s sort of rock basis those meanings are not how the law uses that term when it comes to what the states can do or not do the term has a very specific legal meaning , which means is that amendment of the constitution incorporated against the states \? sen coburn through the 14th amendment \? judge sotomayor throughand others , but thegenerally i should n't say and others through the 14th the question becomes whether and how that amendment of the constitution , that protection , applies or limits the states to act in maloney , the issue for us was a very narrow one we recognized that heller heldand it is the law of the land right now in the sense of precedentthat there is an individual right to bear arms , as it applies to government , federal government , regulation the question in maloney was different for us sen coburn okay judge sotomayor was that right incorporated against the states \? and we determined that , given supreme court precedent , precedent that had addressed that precise question and said it s notso it was n't fundamental in that legal doctrine sensethat was the court s holding sen coburn did the supreme court say in heller that it definitely was not , or did they just fail to rule on it \? judge sotomayor well , they failed to rule on it , you 're right , but i sen coburn okay there s a very big difference there judge sotomayor i agree sen coburn okay let me continue with that so i sit in oklahoma in my home , and what we have today as law in the land as you see it is , i do not have a fundamental incorporated right to bear arms as you see the law today judge sotomayor it s not how i see the law sen coburn well , as you see the interpretation of the law today in your opinion of what the law is today , is my statement a correct statement \? judge sotomayor no , it s not my interpretation i was applying both supreme court precedent deciding that question and 2nd circuit precedent that had directly answered that question and said it s not incorporated the issue of whether or not it should be is a different question , and that is the question that the supreme court may take up in fact , in his opinion , justice scalia suggested it should but it s not what i believe it s what the law has said about it sen coburn so , what does the law say today about the statement \? where do we stand today about my statement that i havei claim to have a fundamental , guaranteed , spelledout right under the constitution , that is individual and applies to me , the right to own and bear arms am i right or am i wrong \? judge sotomayor i ca n't answer of incorporation other than to refer to precedent precedent says sen coburn i understand judge sotomayor as the 2nd circuit interpreted the supreme court s precedent sen coburn i understand that judge sotomayor that it s not ait s not incorporated it s also important to understand that the individual issue of a person bearing arms is raised before the court in a particular setting sen coburn context , yes judge sotomayor and by that i mean what the court will look at is a state regulation of your right and then determine can the state do that or not so , even once you recognize a right , you 're always considering what the state is doing to limit or expand that right , and then decide is that okay constitutionally sen coburn it s very interesting to mei went back and read the history of the debate on the 14th amendment for many of you who do n't now , what generated much of the 14th amendment was , in reconstruction , southern sates were taking away the right to bear arms by freedmen , recently freed slaves and much of the discussion in the congress was to restore that right of the second amendment , through the 14th amendment , to restore an individual right that was guaranteed under the constitution so one of the purposes for the 14th amendment , the reasonone of the reasons it came about is because those rights were being abridged in the southern states postcivil war let me move on in the constitution , we have the right to bear arms whether it s incorporated or not , it s stated there i'm having trouble understanding how we got to a point where a right to privacy , which is not explicitly spelled out but is spelled out to some degree in the fourth amendment , which has settled law and is fixed , and something such as the second amendment , which is spelled out in the constitution , is not settled law and settledfixed i do n't want you to answer that specifically what i would you like to hear you say is , how did we get there \? how did we get to the point where something that s spelled out in our constitution and guaranteed to usbut something that is n't spelled out specifically in our constitution is \? would you give me ayour philosophical answer \? i do n't want to tie you down on any future decisions , but how did we get there when we can read this book and it says certain things and those are n't guaranteed , but the things that it does n't say are \? judge sotomayor one of the frustrations with judges and their decisions by citizens is thatand this was a earlier response to senator cornynwhat we do is different than the conversation that the public has about what it wants the law to do we do n'tjudgesmake law what we do is , we get a particular set of facts presented to us we look at what those facts are , what in the case of different constitutional amendments is , what states are deciding to do or not do , and then look at the constitution and see what it says and attempt to take its words and itsthe principles and the precedents that have described those principles and apply them to the facts before you in discussing the second amendment as it applies to the federal government , justice scalia noted that there had been long regulation by many states on a variety of different issues related to possession of guns and he was n't suggesting that all regulation was unconstitutional he was holding , in that case , that dc s particular regulation was illegal sen coburn right judge sotomayor as you know , there are many states that prohibit felons from possessing guns so does the federal government and so it s not that we make a broad policy choice and say , this is what we want , what judges do what we look at is what other actors in the system are doing , what their interest in doing it is , and how that fits to whatever situation they think they have to fixwhat congress or a state legislature has to fix all of that is the courts' function so i ca n't explain it philosophically i can only explain it by its setting and what the function of judging is about sen coburn letthank you let me follow with one other question as a citizen of this country , do you believe innately in my ability to have selfdefense of myself , personal selfdefense \? do i have a right to personal selfdefense \? judge sotomayor i'm trying to think if i remember a case where the supreme court has addressed that particular question is there a constitutional right to selfdefense \? and i ca n't think of one could be wrong but i ca n't think of one generally , as i understand , most criminallaw statutes are passed by states and i'm also trying to think if there s any federal law that includes a selfdefense provision or not i just ca n't what i was attempting to explain is that the issue of selfdefense is usually defined in criminal statutes by the states' laws and i would think , although i have n't studied theall of the states' laws i'm intimately familiar with new york sen coburn but do you have an opinion , or can you give me your opinion , of whether or not in this country i personally , as an individual citizen , have a right to selfdefense \? judge sotomayor ias i said , i do n't sen coburn i'm talking about your judge sotomayor know i do n't know if that legal question has been ever presented sen coburn i was n't asking about the legal question i'm asking about your personal opinion judge sotomayor but that is sort of an abstract question sen coburn well , it judge sotomayor with nono particular meaning to me outside sen coburn well , i think that s what american people want to hear , your honor , is , they want to know , do they have a right to personal selfdefense \? do judge sotomayor could i sen coburn does the second amendment mean something under the 14th amendment \? does what the constitutionhow they take the constitutionnot how our bright legal minds , but what they think is importantis it okay to defend yourself in your home if you 're under attack \? in other words , the general theory is , do i have that right \? and i understand if you do n't want to answer that because it might influence your position that you might have in a case and that s a fine answer with me but those are the kind of things people like for us to answer and would like to know not how you would rule or what you 're going to rule , butand specifically what you think about it , but just yes or no do we have that right \? judge sotomayor i know it s difficult to deal with someone as like a judge , who s so sort ofwhose thinking is so cornered by law sen coburn i know , it s hard judge sotomayor but could icould i sen coburn kind of like a doctor i ca n't quit using doctor terms i know that judge sotomayor exactly that s exactly right but let me let me try to address what you 're saying in the context that i can , okay , which is what i have experience with , all right , which is new york criminal law , because i was a former prosecutor and i'm talking in very broad terms , but under new york law , if you 're being threatened with imminent death or very serious injury , you can use force to repel that and that would be legal the question that would come up , and does come up before juries and judges , is , how imminent is the threat \? if the threat was in this roomi'm going to come get youand you go home and getor i go homei do n't want to suggest i am , by the way \( laughter , laughs \) please , i'm noti do n't want anybody to misunderstand what i'm trying to say if i go home , get a gun , come back and shoot you , that may not be legal under new york law \( laughter \) because you would have alternative ways to defend sen coburn you 'll have lots of explaining to do \( laughter \) judge sotomayor \( laughs \) i 'd be in a lot of trouble then but i could n't do that under a definition of selfdefense sen coburn okay let judge sotomayor and so that s what i was trying to explain in terms of why , in looking at this as a judge , i'm thinking about how that question comes up and how the answer can differ so radically , given the hypothetical facts before you sen coburn yes , you know judge sotomayor or not the sen coburn the problem isisis we thinkwe doctors think like doctors hard to get out of the doctor s skin judges think like judges lawyers think like lawyers and what american people want to see is inside and what your gut says and part of that s why we 're having this hearing i want to move to one other area you 've been fairly critical of justice scalia s criticism of the use of foreign law in making decisions and i would like for you to cite for me , either in the constitution or in the oath that you took , outside of treaties , the authority that you can have to utilize foreign law in deciding cases in the courts of law in this country judge sotomayor i have actually agreed with justice \( s \) scalia and thomas on the point that one has to be very cautious , even in using foreign law with respect to the things american law permits you toand that s in treaty interpretation or in conflicts of law because it s a different system of law i think sen coburn but i accepted that i said outside of those judge sotomayor well sen coburn in other areas where you will sit in judgment , can you cite for me the authority , either given in your oath or the constitution , that allows you to utilize laws outside of this country to make the decisions about laws inside this country judge sotomayor my speech and my record on this issue because i 've never used it to interpret the constitution or to interpret american statuteis that there is none my speech has made that very clear sen coburn so thereyou stand by thethere is no authority for a supreme court justice to utilize foreign law in terms of making decisions , based on the constitution or statutes \? judge sotomayor unless the statute requires you or directs you to look at foreign lawand some do , by the waythe answer is , no , foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent , or to bind or to influence the outcome of a legal decision interpreting the constitution or american law that does n't direct you to that law sen coburn well , let me give you one of your quotes to suggest to anyone that you can outlaw the use of foreign or international law is a sentiment that s based on a fundamental misunderstanding what you would be asking american judges to do is to close their mind \( s \) to good ideas nothing in the american legal system prevents \( sic \) us from considering those \( sic \) ideas we do n't want judges to have closed minds , just as much as we do n't want judges to consider legislation and foreign law that s developed through bodieselected bodies outside of this country to influence whatand either rightly so or wrongly soagainst what the elected representatives and constitution of this country says so would you kindly explain the difference that i perceive in both this statement versus the way you just answered \? judge sotomayor there is none if you look at my speech , you 'll see that repeatedly i pointed out both that the american legal system was structured not to use foreign law it repeatedly underscored that foreign law could not be used as a holding , as precedent or to interpret the constitution or the statutes what i pointed out to in that speech is that there s a public misunderstanding of the word use in what i was talking about one does n't use those things in the sense of coming to a legal conclusion in a case what judges doand i cited justice ginsburgis educate themselves they build up a story of knowledge about legal thinking , about approaches that one might consider but that s just thinking it s an academic discussion when you 're talking about thinking about ideas than it is how people think about the citation of foreign law in a decision they assume that aifif there s a citation to foreign law , that s driving the conclusion in my experience , when i 've seen other judges cite to foreign law , they 're not using it to drive the conclusion they 're using just to point something out about a comparison between american law or foreign law but they 're not using it in the sense of compelling a result sen coburn i'm not sure i agree with that on certain eighth amendment and 14th amendment cases let melet me go to another area i have just aa short period of time do youdo you feelit s been said that we should worry about what other people think about us in terms of how we interpret our own law and i'm paraphrasing not very well , i believe is it important that we look good to people outside of this country \? or is it more important that we have a jurisprudence that is defined correctly and followed correctly according to our constitution , and whatever the results may be , it s our result rather than a politically correct result that might please other people in the world \? judge sotomayor we do n't render decisions towe do n't render decisions to please the home crowd , or any other crowd i know that because i 've heard speeches by a number of justicesthat in the past justices have indicated that the supreme court has n't taken any treaty cases , and that maybe it should think about doing that , because we 're not participating in the discussion among countries on treaty provisions that are ambiguous that may be of consideration into some justices some have expressed that as a consideration my point is , you do n't rule to please any crowd you rule to get the law right under its terms sen coburn all right thank you thank you , mr chairman sen leahy thank you , mr coburn senator whitehouse sen sheldon whitehouse \( dri \) thank you , mr chairman and welcome again , your honor i have to say before i get into the questions that i have for you that i , like many , many , many americans , feel enormous pride that you are here today and i was talking with some friends in providence when i was home about your nomination , and i said it actually gives me goosebumps to think about the path that has brought you here today , and , more importantly , to think aboutbecause it s not about you more important , to think what that means about america , that path and they said , no , no , no , no you ca n't say goosebumps you have to say 'piel de gallina' judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen whitehouse and so i promised them that i would , so i'm keeping that promise right now but i want to tell you that i think in the way you 've handled yourself in this committee so far , you have done nothing but to vindicate and reinforce the pride that so many people feel in you and i hope that as this process continuesi know these days are long and it can be a bit of an ordeali hope that you very much feel buoyed and sustained by that pride and that optimism and that confidence that people across this country feel for you and that so many people in this room feel for you so i wanted to say that i also wanted to fulfill another promise , which was the one i made to you , thatin my opening statement i said i would ask you to make a simple pledge , and that simple pledge is that you will decide cases on the law and the facts before you , that you will respect the role of congress as representatives of the american people , that you will not prejudge any case but will listen to every party that comes before you , and that you will respect precedent and limit yourself to the issues that the court must decide may i ask you to make that pledge judge sotomayor i can that s the pledge i would take if i was that i took as district court judge , as a circuit court judge , and if i am honored to be confirmed by this body , that i would take as a supreme court justice , yes sen whitehouse thank you some of my colleagues have raised questions about your role at the puerto rican legal defense and education fund many years ago before you left that organization to become a federal trial judge in 1992 , i guess it was i just want to clarify , that was clearly a part of your history and your package that came to the senate at the time of those confirmations , when you were confirmed both in 1992 and 1997 so this is nothing new to the senate is that correct \? judge sotomayor that s correct sen whitehouse and in terms of the way that the puerto rican legal defense and education fund operated , you were a member of the board is that correct \? judge sotomayor i was sen whitehouse did the attorneys for the puerto rican legal defense and education fund make it a practice to vet their legal filings with the board first \? did the board approve individual briefs and arguments that were made by attorneys for the organization \? judge sotomayor no , because most of us on the board did n't have civil rights experience i had actuallywhen i was a prosecutor in private practice , that was n't my specialty of law even if they tried to show it to me , i do n't know that i could have made a legal judgment ifeven if i tried that was not our function we sen whitehouse and i think that s customary in charitable organizationsfor the board not to sign off specifically on briefs and other legal filings that the attorneys make and certainly in the years i 've spent on the boards of charitable organizationsnever been something presented to me so i appreciate that and in 1992 and in 1997 , when the senate was again fully aware of all that , was there to your recollection any objection made in those confirmations \? judge sotomayor i do n't believe any question was asked about my service on the puerto rican legal defense and education fund the fund is an organization that has and has been considered in the mainstream of civil rights organizations , like the naacp and the mexican american legal defense and education fund it promotes the civil rights of its community sen whitehouse let me turn to some more general questions , if i may , and one has to do with the role of the jury , not just in trials obviously you 're eminently familiar with the role of juries in trials i think you 'll be the only member of the united states supreme court , if you are confirmed , to actually have had federal trial judge experience , which i think is a valuable attribute but i'm not thinking so much about the role of the jury in the courtroom as i am about the role of the jury in the american system of government when the constitution was set up , as you know so well , the founders made great efforts to disaggregate power , to create checks and balances , and the matrix of separated powers that they created has served us very , very well in the course of that , or as a part of that , the founders also revealed some very strongly felt concerns about the hazards of both unchecked power and of the vulnerability of the legislative and executive branches to either corruption or to being consumed and overwhelmed by passing passions and i 'd love to hear your thoughts on the importance of the jury in that american system of government and , if you could , with particular reference to the concerns of the founders about the vulnerabilities of the elected branches judge sotomayor like you , i amand perhaps because i was a state prosecutor and i have been a trial judge , and so i 've had very extensive experience with jury trials in the american criminal law context i have had less in the civil law context as a private practitioner , but much more as a district court judgei can understand why our founding fathers believed in the system of juries i have found in my experience with juries that virtually every juror i have ever dealt with , after having experienced the process , came away heartened , more deeply committed to the fundamental importance of their role as citizens in that process every juror i ever dealt with showed great attention to what was going on , took their responsibilities very seriously i had a juror who was in the middle of deliberations , on her way to my courtroomnot on the way to my courtroomon her way home from court on the previous day , broke her leg , was in the hospital the entire night , came back the next morning , on time , in a wheelchair , with a cast that went up to her hip what a testament , both to that woman and to the importance of jury service to our citizens i was very active in ensuring that her service was recognized by our court it has a central role its importance to remember is that it has n't been fully incorporated against the states many states limit jury trials in different ways and so the question of inwhat cases require a jury trial and what do n't is still somewhat within the discretion of states but it is a very important part of a sense of protection for defendants accused in criminal cases , and one that i personally value from my experience with it sen whitehouse and doesdodoes the founders' concern about the potential vulnerabilities or liabilities about the elected branch illuminate the importance of the jury system \? judge sotomayor senator , ias i see the jury system , i do n't know exactlyi do n't actuallyand i 've read the federalist papers \( chuckles \) and i 've read other historical accounts the jury system wasi thought the basic premise of it was to ensure that a person subject to criminal liability would have a group of his or her peers pass judgment on whether that individual had violated the law or not to the extent that the constitution looked to the courts to determine whether a particular act was or was not constitutional , it seems to me that that was a different function than what the jury was intended to serve the jury , as i understood it , was to ensure that a person s guilt or innocence was determined by a group of peers to the extent that that has a limit on the elected branches , it s to ensure that someone is prosecuted under the law and that the law is applied to them in the way that the law is written and intended sen whitehouse and , where the jury requirement applies to civil trials , the argument would be the same , correct \? judge sotomayor yes sen whitehouse again on the question of the american system of government , how would you characterize the founders' view of any exercises of unilateral or unchecked power by any of the three branches of government in the overall scheme \? judge sotomayor the constitution , by its terms , sets forth the powers and limits of each branch of government and so to the extent that there are limits recognized in the constitution , that is clearly what the constitution intends the bill of rights , the amendments set forth there are often viewed as limits on government action and so it s a question always of looking at what the constitution says and howwhat kind of scope it gives for a government action at issue sen whitehouse would you feel , in light of all of the attentionvery , very careful and thoroughly thoughtout attention that the constitution gives to establishing and enforcing a whole variety of different checks and balances among the different powers of governmentthat a judge who was presented with an argument that a particular branch of government should exercise or have the authority to exercise unilateral , unchecked power in a particular area should approach that argument with a degree of heightened caution or attention \? judge sotomayor the best framework that has been set out on this question of a unilateral act by one branch or another , but usually it s athe challenge is raised when the executive is doing something because the executive executes the law sen whitehouse yes judge sotomayor takes the action , typically the best description of how to approach those questions was done by justice jackson in his concurring opinion in the youngstown s case and that opinion laid out a framework that generally is applied to all questions of executive action , which is that you have to look at the powers of each branch together you have to start with , what has congress said , express or implicitly \? and if it s authorized to do something to let the president do something , then the president s acting at the height of his powers if congress has implicitly prohibitedexpressly or implicitly prohibited something , then the president s acting at the lowest ebb of his powers there s a zone of twilight , which is the zone in betweenwhich is , has congress said something or not said something \? in all of the situations , once you 've looked at what congress has done or not done , you then are directed to look at what the president s powers may be under the constitution minus whatever powers congress has in that area so the whole exercise is really , in terms of congress and the executive , an exercise of the two working together and in fact , that s the basic structure of our system of government that s why the congress makes the laws the president can veto them , but he ca n't make them he can regulate if congress gives him the authority to do so , and within other delegated authorities or i should n't use the word delegated , because it has a legal meaning but the point is that that question s always looked at in light of what congress has said on the issue and in light of congress s power as specified in the constitution sen whitehouse let me change to a more lawenforcementoriented topic i appreciate , first of all , very much your service in district attorney morgenthau s office it is a \( n \) office that prosecutors around the country look at with great pride and a sense of its long tradition and of the very great capability of the prosecutors who serve in it it s a very proud office , and i'm delighted that you serve there and i think it says a great deal about you that , coming out of law school and college with the stellar academic record that you had and an entire world of opportunities open to you , you chose that rather poorly paid office and since you 've met 89 of us , i doubt you remember all of our conversations , but when you and i had the chance to meet , we compared who had the worst office as a new prosecutor and i think you won and so it was a very important moment for a , at that point , quite new lawyer to make a very significant statement about who you were and what your purpose was and so i very much appreciate that you made that choice and i think prosecutors like my colleague senator klobuchar and many others around this country , senatorand our chairman , senator leahymade that choice over the years , and it s one that i think merits a salute one of the things that prosecutors have to deal with all the time is search and seizure and warrants and my question has to do with the warrant requirement under the constitution i see the constitution as being changeless , timeless and immutable what changes is society , as you pointed out in your testimony earlier , and technology and so new questions arise and i 'd be interested in your reaction to the difference between the experience of society and the technology of society when the founders set up the warrant requirement originally , and today when the founders set up the warrant requirement originally , when the sheriff or somebody went to seize property to bring it in as evidence for a trial or to condemn it as contraband , that was sort of the end of it if it was evidence , when it was done it was returned and it went backparticularly , papers were returnedand that was the end of it then came the xerox machine , and now the government could make copies of what they took and it was returned , as always , just as the founders had intended , but copies were sprinkled throughout government files very often , ones that ended up in archives buildings and dusty boxes that it would have taken enormous effort to locate , but nevertheless , they remained available and nowadays , with electronic databases and electronic search functions , matters that once would have been returned to the individual and that envelope of privacy that was opened by the warrant , would have been closed again , are now potentially eternally available to government , eternally searchable and it raises some very interesting privacy questions that we will have to face in this congress and in this senate , as we begin to take on issues particularly of cybersecurity , cyberattacks , cyberterrorism , and take advantage of what technology can bring to bear in the continued struggle against terrorist extremists so i 'd be interested in your thoughts on how the constitution , which is unchanged through all of thatwhat analysis you would go through to see whether the change from a quickly opening and closing privacy envelope to one that is now essentially open season forever how would you go about analyzing that as a judge , given that the constitution is a fixed document \? judge sotomayor i think , as i understand your question , senator , that there are two issuesif not more , but the two that i note as more starkly for me in your question is the one of the search and seizure and the fourth amendment as it applies to taking evidence from an individual and use it against him or her in a current proceeding sen whitehouse yes , which is a constant judge sotomayor that sen whitehouse that stayed the same judge sotomayor that s generally the structure innot so long ago , the supreme court dealt with a technologically new situation , which was whether an individual had a right to expect a warrant to be gotten before law enforcement flew over his ori think it was a his in that casehis home and took readings of the thermal energy emanating from his home and then going in to see if the person was growing marijuana sen whitehouse the flir case judge sotomayor exactly and in that case , the reason for that case is that apparently i'm not an expert in marijuanagrowing \( laughs \) but apparently when you 're growing marijuana there s acertain heating lights that you need at least , that s what the case was describing and it generates this enormous amount of heat that would n't generally come from a home unless you were doing something like this and what the court did there , in an opinion by justice scalia , i believe it was , is it looked at the embedded questions of privacy in the home that underlied \( sic \) the unreasonable search and seizure and the court there , as i mentioned , determined that acts taken in the privacy of one s home would commonly not be expected to be intruded upon unless the police secured a warrant and to the extent that the law had generally recognized that if you work actively to keep people out of your homeyou locked your windows , you locked your doors , you did n't let people walk by and peek through , you did n't stand at your front door and show people what you were doingthat you were exhibiting your expectation of privacy and to the extent that new technology had developed that you would n't expect to intrude on that privacy , then you were protected by the warrant clause , and the police had an obligation to go talk to a magistrate and explain to them what their evidence was and let the magistratei use the magistrate in that more global sense it would be a judge , but in theyou would let a judge decide whether there was probable cause to issue the warrantreasonable suspicion , probable cause probable cause to issue the warrant that s how the courts address the unreasonableor have addressed the supreme court hasthe unreasonable search and seizure , and balanced the new technology with the expectations of privacy that are recognized in the fourth amendment you asked , i thought , a separate question , which in my mind is different than the right to privacy , with respect to personal information that could be otherwise available to the public as a byproduct of a criminal action or as a byproduct of your participation in some regulated activity of the government there are situations in which , if your industry s regulated , you 're going to make disclosures to the government and then the question becomes how much , in what circumstances can then government make copies , put it in an electronic database or use it in another situation so much of that gets controlled by the issues you 're saying congress is thinking about , which is , what are people s rights of privacy in their personal information \? should we , as congress , as a matter of policy , regulate that use \? the courts itself have been commanded by congress to look at certain privacy information of individuals and guard it from public disclosure in the databases you 're talking about so we 've been told , do n't go using somebody s social security number and putting it in a database that is a part of a public document , but we 've been told , do n't do that and there s a reason for that , because there is not only the issues of identity theft but other harms that could come to people from that situation so that broader question , as with many , is not one that one could talk about a philosophy about as a judge , you have to look at the situation at issue think about what congress has said about that in the laws , and then consider what the constitution may or may not say on that question , depending on the nature of the claim before the court sen whitehouse your honor , i thank you i wish you well judge sotomayor thank you sen whitehouse and i congratulate you on your appearance before this committee so far judge sotomayor thank you sen leahy senator whitehouse , thank you i appreciate the comments getting into the area of criminal law of course senator whitehouse has served as both a us attorney and as an attorney general , and brings a great depth of knowledge , as do several on both the republican and democratic side , to this committee judge , we 'reand i also appreciate you taking less on your time i hope maybe you 'll be setting a standard as we go forward judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen leahy we will take a 15minute break \( sounds gavel \) \( recess \) sen leahy \( sounds gavel \) there has been a \( n \) interest expressed byi was going to say by all the senators , but most senators have left the hearing room but do n't think that does n't mean that there s not going to be more questions , judge , because there 'll be this round , and another round and if it s a case of all the questions having been asked but not everybody has asked all of the questions , some will come back and ask them again what we 're going to do , we 're going to have senator klobuchar and senator kaufman will ask questions , and we will then break for lunch we 'll then have senator specter and senator franken ask questions and i'm saying this for the purpose , also , of those who have to schedule and plan we 'll take a break for lunch after these two senators we will then go into the traditional closeddoor session , which will be held in the senate judiciary committee room so senator klobucharwe seem to be heavy on prosecutors here she is also a former prosecutorand i yield to you sen amy klobuchar \( dmn \) thank you very much , mr chairman good afternoon , judge thank you again for all of your patience and your thoughtful answers i reallyeveryone has been focusing on you sitting there i have been focusing on how patient your mother has been through this whole thing judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen klobuchar because i ran into her in the restroom just now , and i can tell you , she has a lot she 'd like to say judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen klobuchar she has plenty of stories that she would like to share about you i thought i might miss my questioning opportunity judge sotomayor senator , do n't give her the chance ! \( laughs , laughter \) sen klobuchar but i was thinking she is much more sen leahy the chairman is tempted , let me tell you \( laughter \) sen klobuchar she is much more patient than my mother has been , who has been waiting for this moment for me to ask these questions , and leaving messages like , how long do these guys have to go on \? \( laughter \) my favorite one , the recent one , was , i watched senator feinstein , and she was brilliant what are you going to do \? judge sotomayor \( laughs , laughter \) sen klobuchar okay so , let s move on i had some judge sotomayor we should introduce our mothers , okay \? sen klobuchar yes , exactly i have some quick questions here at the beginning , just to follow up on some of the issues raised by my colleagues senator coburn was asking you about the heller case and second amendment issues and i personally agree with the heller case , but i remember that yesterday you said that in maloney , your 2nd circuit case , that you were bound by precedent in your circuit , but that you would keep an open mind if the supreme court takes up the question of whether the second amendment can be incorporated against the states is that right \? judge sotomayor yes , senator i take every case casebycase and my mind is always open , and i make no prejudgments as to conclusions sen klobuchar okay , and then a followup on a question that senator whitehouse was asking you about the puerto rican legal defense fund , theyou were on that board and one just minor followup , but is n't it true that the abathat their code of conduct , the american bar association code of conduct bars board members from engaging in litigation , because of a lack of an actual lawyerclient relationship \? judge sotomayor yes sen klobuchar okay and then finally , just one point we 've heard so much about your speech in which you used the phrase wise latina , and i'm not going to go over that again but i did want to note for the record that you made a similar comment in another speech that you gave back in 1994 , which you have provided not only in this proceeding , but you also provided it when you came before the senate for confirmation to the circuit court in 1997 , in 1998 and no senator at that timedo you remember them asking you about it or making any issue about it at the time \? judge sotomayor no sen klobuchar all right thank you now we can move on to what i want to talk about , which is your work as a criminal prosecutor and senator whitehouse initially asked a few questions about that you were quoted in the new york times a while back about your time there , and you said , the one thing i have found is that if you come into the criminal justice system on a prosecutorial or defense level thinking that you can change the ills of society , you 're going to be sorely disappointed this is not where those kinds of changes have to be made do you want to elaborate on that a little bit \? judge sotomayor by the time a criminal defendant ends up in court , they 've been shaped by their lives if you want to give people the best opportunity at success at lifeit s a message i deliver frequently to my communityit has to be through early childhood forward if you 're waiting to do that once they 're before a judge in court , your chances of success have diminished dramatically and so one of my messages in many of my speeches to my community groups is , pay attention to education it s the value mom taught me , but her lesson hadwas not lost on me when i became a prosecutor and it s a lesson that i continue to promote , because i so fervently believe it the success of our communities depends on us improving the quality of our education of our children and of parental participation in ensuring that that happens in our society sen klobuchar it also reminded me , that comment , about some of the comments you 've made about the limited rolesthat a prosecutor has one role , and the limited role that a judge may have to respect that judicial role of not making the laws but interpreting the laws would that be a correct summary \? judge sotomayor that isin the statement i made to the newspaper article , i was focusing on a different part of that what it is , as a prosecutor my role was not to look at what i thought the punishment should have been , because that was set in law sentences are set by congress within statutory ranges , and my role was to prosecute on behalf of the people of the state of new york and that role is different than one that i would do if i were a defense attorney , whose charge is to do something else , to ensure that a defendant is given a fair trial and that the government has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt but we cannot remedy the ills of society in the courtroom we can only apply the law to the facts before us sen klobuchar yeah , i think justice ginsburg made a similar comment in an article this weekend , in an interview she did and she was talking aboutthis was her exact quote the legislature can make the change , can facilitate the change , as laws like the family medical leave act do she was talking about family arrangements but it s not something a court can decree a court ca n't tell the man , she said , you 've got to do more than carry out the garbage i thought that was another way ofyou do n't have to comment on that , but it was another way of making the same point the other thing that i wanted to focus on was that just that role as prosecutor , some of the difficult decisions you have to make about charging cases , for instance sometimes you have to make a difficult decision to charge a family member , maybe , in a drunk driving case where someone kills their own child because they were drunk , or you have to make a decision when the court of public opinion has already decided someone s guilty but you realize you do n't have enough evidence to charge the case do you want to talk about anymaybe a specific example of that , in your own career as a prosecutor , or what goes into your thinking on charging \? judge sotomayor i was influenced so greatly by a television show in igniting the passion that i had as being a prosecutor , and it was perry mason for the young people behind all of you \( laughter \) you may not even know who perry mason was but perry mason was one of the first lawyers portrayed on television , and his story line is that in all of the cases he tried , except one , he proved his client innocent and got the actual murderer to confess in one of the episodes , at the end of the episode , perry mason , with the character who played the prosecutor in the case , were meeting up after the case , and perry said to the prosecutor it must cause you some pain , having expended all that effort in your case , to have the charges dismissed and the prosecutor looked up and said no , my job as a prosecutor is to do justice , and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not and i thought to myself that s quite amazing , to be able to serve that role to be given a job , as i was by mr morgenthau , a job i'm eternally grateful to him for , in which i could do what justice required in an individual case and it was not without bounds , because i served a role for society , and that role was to ensure that the public safety and public interest were fully represented but prosecutors in each individual case , at least in my experience , particularly under the tutelage of mr morgenthau , was , we did what the law required within the bounds of understanding that our job was not to play to the home crowd , not to look for public approval , but to look at each casein some respects , like a judge doesindividually sen klobuchar well judge sotomayor and that meant in some cases bringing the top charge and i was actually known in my office for doing that often , but that s because i determined it was appropriate often but periodically i would look at the quality of evidence and say , \( there s it s \? \) just not enough i had one case with a \( n \) individual who was charged with committing a larceny from a woman , and his defense attorney came to me and said , i never , ever do this , but this kid is innocent please look at his background he s a kid with a disability talk to his teachers look at his life look at his record here it is and he gave me the file and everythingshe said was absolutely true this was a kid with not a blemish in his life and he said , please look at this case more closely and i went and talked to the victim , and shei had not spoken to her when the case was indicted this was one of those cases that was transferred to me , and so it was my first time in talking to her and i let her tell me the story , and it turned out she had never seen who took her pocketbook in that case , she saw a young man that the police had stopped in a subway station with a black jacket , and she thought she had seen a black jacket , and identified the young man as the one who had stolen her property the young man , when he was stopped , did n't run away he was just sitting there her property was n't on him and he had the background that he did and i looked at that case and took it to my supervisor and said , i do n't think we can prove this case and my supervisor agreed , and we dismissed the charges and yet there are others that i 've prosecuted , very close cases , where i thought a jury should decide if someone was guilty and i prosecuted those cases , and , more often than not , got convictions my point is that that is such a wonderful part of being a prosecutor that tv character said something that motivated my choices in life and something that holds true and that s not to say , by the wayand i firmly , firmly believe this defense attorneys serve a noble role as well all participants in this process do judges , juries , prosecutors and defense attorneys we are all implementing the protections of the constitution sen klobuchar well , thank you that was very well said and i want to take that pragmatic experience that you 've had not just as a civil litigator but also as a prosecutor a lot has been said about whether judges' biases or their gender or their race should enter into decisionmaking and i actually thought that senator schumer did a good job of asking you questions where , in fact , you might have been sympathetic to a particular victim or to a particular plaintiff , but you ruled against them and i actually madegave me some answers to give to this baggage carrier that came up to me at the airport in minneapolis it was about a month ago , after you had just been announced and he came up and he said , are you going to vote for that woman \? and at first i did n't even know what he was talking about i said , what \? he said , are you going to vote for that woman \? i said , well , i think so , but i want to ask her some questions and he said , well , are n't you worried that her emotions get in front of the law \? and i thought if anyone heard the cases , the twa case , where you decided againsthad to make a decision from some very sympathetic victims , the families of people who had been killed in a plane crash , and a host of other cases where you put the law in front of where your sympathies lie , i think that would have been a very good answer to him , but another piece of this that s a very different part of it is the practical experiences that you 've had , the pragmatic work that you 've done and i just wanted to go through some of the cases that you 've had , the criminal cases that you 've handled as a judge , and talk to you a little bit about how that pragmatic experience might be helpful on the courts not leading you to always side with the prosecution , obviously , but helping you to maybe ferret through the facts , as you 've been known to be someone that really focused on the facts one of them is this united states v falso case this was a case where child pornography was found in a guy s home and on his computer and you ruled that although the police officers did n't have probable cause for the search warrant , that the evidence obtained in the search , the child pornography on the computer , should still be considered under the goodfaith exception to the exclusionary rule because the judge had not been knowingly misled , and in other words , it was a mistake and could you talk about that case and how perhaps having that kind of experience on the front line helped you to reach that decision \? because there was someone , i believe , that dissented in that case judge sotomayor that case presented a very complicated question in 2nd circuit law there had been two cases addressing how much information a warrant had to contain , and what kind , in order for the police to search a defendant s homeor i should n't say a homea computerto see if the computer contained images of child pornography the two casesi should say the two panelsi was n't a member of either of those panelshad very extensive discussion about the implications of the cases because they involved the use of the internet and how much information the police should or should not have before they looked to get a warrant to search someone s computer , because the computer does provide people with freedom of speech , at least with respect to accessing information and reading it and thinking about it in the case before me , i was looking at it in the backdrop of the conflict that it appeared to contain in our case law , and what our case law said was important for a police officer to share with a judge and examine the facts before my case looking at thatthe information that the police have before them , and considering whether , in light of existing 2nd circuit law as it addressed this issue , had the police actually violated the \( problem with microphone \) oh , i hope i can continue \( laughs \) sen leahy you canyou can continue that was notthat was \( laughter \) i have certain powers as chairman , but not that much \( laughter \) senator klobuchar sen klobuchar please go on judge sotomayor whether they should get a warrant or not and one member of the court said yes andthey had violated the constitution and i joined that part of the opinion because i determined , examining all of the facts of that case thatand the lawthat that was the way the lawthe result the law required but then , i looked at what the principles underlying the unreasonable search and seizures are without a warrant , and looked at the question of what was the doctrine that underlay there and what doctrine it underlays is that you do n't want the police violating your constitutional rights without a goodfaith basis , without probable cause and that s why you have a judge make that determination that s why you require them to go to a judge and so what i had to look at was whether we should make the police responsible for what would have been otherwise a judge s error , not their error they gave everything they had to the judge and they said to the judge , i do n't know , even if they thought they knew that is n't what commands the warrant it s the judge s review so , i was the judge in the middle \( chuckles \) one judge joined one part of my opinion the other judge joined the other part of the opinion and so , i held that the acts violated the constitution , but that the evidence could still be used because the officers had there was in law a goodfaith exception to the error in the warrant sen klobuchar and i think you made a similar finding , with different underlying facts , in united states v santa , when that involved a clerical error and then , that was a case where the underlying arrest warrantwhere someone had been arrested they found cocaine and you allowed that in on the basis that the underlying arrest warrant , even though it was falsethere had n't been a warrant out there it had been removedthat that was a clerical error and you could stillthey could still use the cocaine judge sotomayor well , in fact , it s a holding the supreme court an issue the supreme court addressed just this term sen klobuchar exactly judge sotomayor came outor i came out the way the supreme court did on that issue sen klobuchar the hearing case judge sotomayor yes sen klobuchar yeah very good judge sotomayor \( chuckles \) sen klobuchar thethethe piece of thatthatthe case in the supreme court that s most interesting to me in terms of that issue we 've been talking about , that practical knowledge and how that plays into decisions , is the melendezdiaz case , which you were not involved in it was a us supreme court case but this is just from own my practical work as a prosecutor and it was a contested case with the supreme court it did n't divide ideologically in fact , both justice breyer and justice roberts were in the dissent , andthat justice kennedy wrote it was a 54 decision and in that case the issue was whether or not with the confrontation clause , whether or not lab workers , crimelab workers , should be called in to have to testify for drugs and what the test showed that was in the drugs and things like that and i just wondered what your reaction was to that case , how you would have analyzed it i agree with the dissent in that case i think that this could reallyit opens up 90 years of precedent i think it s unreasonable for what we should expect of the criminal justice system and there s been some pretty strong language in the dissent of the fear that this will create some verydifficulties for prosecutors to follow through on their cases and get the evidence in judge sotomayor it s always difficult to deal with people s disappointments about cases , particularly when they have personal experiences and have their own sense of the impact of a case i was a former prosecutor , and it s difficult proving cases as it is calling more witnesses adds some burdens to the process but at the end , that case is a decided case and so its holding now is its holding , and that s what guides the court in the future on similar issues , to the extent there can be some as i said , i do recognize that there can be problems , as a former prosecutor but that also ca n't compel a result and all of those issues have to be looked at in the context of the court s evaluation of the case and the judge s view of what the law permits and does n't permit sen klobuchar i will say , i wasthere was an interesting story a few weeks ago aboutjust that you 've been tenacious about getting to the bottom of the facts when you have cases and there were actually some experts that criticized you for spending too much time trying to figure out the facts , which i thought was a pretty unique criticism in thein thein the halls of criticisms and in fact , you were defended by a former clerk to clarence thomas , who said that you are extraordinarily thorough and a judge would ordinarily be praised for writing thorough opinions so when we 're talking about melendezdiaz and some of those issues , it seems to me that , when you have looked at cases involving criminal justice , or really any issue , whether it s that vermont ferry case that you did or other ones , you really did delve into the facts do you want to talk a little bit about why that s important \? judge sotomayor the facts are the basis for the legal decision a judge deals with a particular factual setting and applying the law to those facts to the extent that there s any criticism that i do that on the court of appeals , we 're not factfinders , but we have to ensure that we understand the facts of the case to know what legal principle we 're applying it to a judge s job , whether it s on the trial level , the circuit court , or even the supreme court , is not to create hypothetical cases and answer the hypothetical case it s to answer the case that exists and so in my viewand i'm not suggesting any justice does this or does n't do itbut i do think that my work as a state prosecutor and a trial judge sensitizes me to understanding and approaching cases starting from the facts , and then applying the law to those facts as they exist and i'mand again , i do n't want to suggest that not all judges do that but because ibecause of my background , perhaps like justice souter , who salso has the reputation of carefully looking at the facts and applying the law to the facts , it may be that background that people are noticing , and noticing where we picked up that habit sen klobuchar very good thein a report issued last week , the transactional records access clearinghousei did n't know there was such a thingfound that you sent more convicts to prison and handed out longer sentences than your colleagues did when you were a district court judge one statistic found that you handed out sentence \( sic \) of greater than six months to 48 percent of convicted criminals in whitecollar cases , while your colleagues gave out sentences of six months or more to just 36 percent you were also twice as likely as your colleagues to send whitecollar criminals to two years or more in prison i found the whitecollar cases to be some of the most challenging cases that we had in our office when i was a prosecutor they were challenging because there was oftentimes sympathy , and you do n't maybe this is dating myself 10 years ago , there used to be more sympathybut there was sympathy to people who were pilots we had taxevasion cases with pilots or we had a judge that we prosecuted who had a halfday of his friends come and testify that he should n't go to jail , including the former miss america and so wei have found those cases to be difficult could you talk a little bit about your view of sentencing in general and sentencing of whitecollar defendants in particular \? judge sotomayor it should be remembered that , when i was a district court judge , the sentencing laws were different than they have become during my 12 years on the court of appeals backand it makes me sound ancient , but back in the days when i was a district court judge , the sentencing guidelines were focused on the amount of a fraud , and did n't consider the number of victims or theor the consequences on the number of victims of a crime perhaps because of my prosecutorial background , perhaps because i considered the perspective of prosecutors who came before me that the guidelinesand their argumentsthat the guidelines did n't adequately consider the number of victims and that that should be a factor , because someone who commits a hundred thousand 1 well , not 1 thousanddollar crimes may be as culpable as the person who does a onetime act of a hundred thousand , and depending on the victims and the impact on the victims , those are factors that one should consider and so , many of the whitecollar sentences that you are talking about were focused on looking at the guidelines and what the guidelines were addressing , and ensuring that i was considering , as the sentencing statutes require the court to do , atall of the circumstances of the crime i suspect that may drive one of the reasons why i may have given higher whitecollar crime sentences than some of my colleagues it s not to suggest they did n't listen to the argument , but they may have had a different perspective on it i should tell you that my circuit endorsed that factor as a consideration under the guidelines somewhat after i had started imposing sentences on this view , but they also agreed that this was a factor the courts could consider in fashioning a sentence crime is crime and to the extent that you 're protecting the interests of society , you take your cues from the statute congress gives and the sentencing range that congress sets and so to the extent that in all my cases i balanced the individual sentence with , as i was directed to , the interests that society sought to protect , then i applied that evenhandedly to all cases it s important to remember the guidelines were mandatory , and so i took my charge as a district court judge seriously at the time to only deviate in the very unusual case , which was permitted by the guidelines sen klobuchar and what do you think about the change now that they are guidelines andsuggested guidelines and not mandatory \? judge sotomayor as you know , there s been great number of cases in the supreme court the booker fanfan line ofthe booker fanfan case determined they were guidelines my own personal experience withas an appellate judge is that because the supreme court has told the district courts to give serious consideration to the guidelines , there s been a little bitnot a little bitthere s been discretion given to district courts but they are basically still staying within the guidelines , and i think that s because the guidelines prove useful as a starting point to consider what an appropriate sentence may be sen klobuchar and i willjust one last question , mr chairman all these guys have been asking about your baseball case , and they 've been talking about umpires and judges as umpires did you have a chance to watch the allstar game last night \? \( soft laughter \) because most of america did n't watch the replay of your hearing \( laughter \) they might have been watching it judge sotomayor i have n't seen television \( laughter \) sen klobuchar \( laughs \) judge sotomayor for a very long time sen klobuchar well judge sotomayor but i will admit that i turned it on for a little while last night \( laughter \) sen klobuchar okay , because there was , i will sayand maybe you did n't turn it on , on this momentbut your yankee , derek jeter , tied it up but you must know that he scored only because there was a hit by joe mauer of the minnesota twins judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen klobuchar i just want to point that out all right thank you very much , judge judge sotomayor that s what teamwork helps you with \( soft laughter \) sen klobuchar okay thank you sen leahy i'm resisting any red sox comments \( laughter \) \( chuckling \) and i'm going to be careful judge sotomayor the president \( begged \? \) you all not to hold that against me , okay \? \( laughs \) sen leahy i'm not going to use that against you i did see a photograph of the president throwing out the ball i know the photographer well , and i did a veryvery good shot there are two pictures senator kaufman is probably as knowledgeable as anybody on this committee , having run it for years before becoming a senator judge sotomayor \( chuckles \) sen leahy i 've before , judge , that senators are merely constitutional requirements or impediments to the staff they know who really runs the place and senator kaufman , it s over to you , sir sen edward kaufman \( dde \) thank you , mr chairman i sen leahy oh , and i couldshould make one announcement you 've been hearing some banging going on here apparently the air conditioning went out , which will probably come as welcome news to the some of the press who are freezing in the skyboxes up here \( soft laughter \) but is not welcome news here , andwith the crowd going on and they are working on it but i'mwe 're going to keep going as long as we can sen kaufman thank you , mr chairman iyou know , one of the toughest assignmentsi 've been here long enough to know the toughest assignment is to stand between the audience and lunch \( soft laughter \) so i'm going to try to bear up under that good afternoon judge sotomayor good afternoon , senator it s good to be talking to you again sen kaufman it s good to see you and i want to kind of take a different tack i think senator whitehouse and senator klobuchar talked a lot about your time as a prosecutor i 'd like to move on to kind of your time as a commercial litigator and you were a prosecutor for five years then you decided to go into commercial practice and i justwhat kind of were the thoughts behind deciding when you left the da s office to go into commercial practice \? judge sotomayor well , actually , it s a continuation of what i explained to senator klobuchar i had in the da s office realized that in the criminal law system we could n't effect changes of opportunity for people we were dealing with a discrete issue and applying the law to the situation at hand that if there was going to be an increase of opportunity for all people , that that had to involve an increase in economic opportunity and in economic development for different communities and so that , in combination with my desire to broaden my own personal understanding of as many aspects of law as i couldi decided that i should change my focus and concentrate on commercial matters , rather than criminal matters it also guided some of themuch of the pro bono work i did thereafter , which also involved questions of finances and economic opportunities and so , i served on the new york state mortgage board , and thatthe new york state mortgage office was involved in giving individuals affordable housing , or loans for affordable housing i was a board member of the new york city campaign finance board those were activitieswere motivated in large measure because of my growing belief that economic opportunities for people were the way to address many of theof the growth needs of communities sen kaufman can you tell us a little bit about your commercial practice \? what actually were you dealing with as a litigator \? judge sotomayor it was a wonderful practice because , unlike some of my law school friends , i very much wanted to go into a small law firm where i could have handson practice having been a prosecutor and having made all of the decisions , individual decisions , i made , i thought to myself as i was leaving the da s office , i do n't think i can go to those firms where i would be the fifth guy on the totem pole \( chuckles \) that i wanted to have more handson experience so i went to a much smaller firm where i actually , until i became a partner , tended to work directly with the partner , and would often counsel businesses and i did a wide variety of commercial issues i was involved in grain commodity trading , people buying homegrown , us grains of all kindswheat , oat , you could name them all and including orange peels as feed for animals , okay \? and the contracts that they were involved in , in doing those trades our firm represented a very impressive list of clients , including ferrari , the car manufacturer and i did a great deal of their work as it related to their dealer relationships and to their customer relationships and so i involved myself in those commercial transactionswhich were different , different focus , different emphasis i also representednot me , but the firmbut i counseled the client on many of its dealer relations issues of pirelli tire corporation these are names i suspect many people know sen kaufman yeah judge sotomayor and fendi , the fashion designerand i think there are many people who know how famous that fashion house design is had trademark questions and i participated with the partner who founded that practice within the law firm and she had a very untimely death actually , she came from her home ill to vote on my partnership at the firm and i became a partner and a couple of months later , she passed away but she had worked with me and introduced me to the intellectual property area of law i worked on real estate matters i worked on contract matters of all kinds , licensing agreements , financing agreements , banking questions there was such a wide berth of issues that i dealt with sen kaufman and how did that practice help you on the district court and then on the circuit court of appeals \? judge sotomayor actually , one of the lessons i learned from my commercial practice i learned in the context first of my grain commodity trading , but in the work as it related to all commercial disputes there were one main lesson in business , the predictability of law may be the most necessary , in the sense that people organize their business relationships by what theyhow they understand the courts interpret their contract i remember being involved in any number of litigations where at the end of the litigation , as a part of a settlement , i would draft a settlement agreement between the parties , and quite often it involved ancreating an ongoing new business relationship or a temporary continuation of a business relationship so they could wind down and i would draft up the agreement like a litigator , like the judge i try to be say it in simple words , okay \? and i would give it to my corporate partners , andi should n't say it this wayand i would get back stuff that sometimes i 'd look at and say , what does this gobbledygook mean \? and they would laugh at me and say it has meaning this is how the courts have interpreted it s very important to the relationship of the parties that they know what the expectations are in law about their relationship and then i understood why it was important to phrase things in certain ways and it made me very respectful about the importance of predictability in terms of courts' interpretation of business terms , because that was very , very critical to organizing business relationships in our country sen kaufman one of the basic jobs of district court judges is to kind of avoid trial , kind of get people to settle before they get to trial how did your commercial experience help you deal with that \? judge sotomayor it s interesting , becausei remember one case withand i ca n't give you details sen kaufman sure judge sotomayor because i would be breaching confidentiality but i remember a client coming in to me with a fairly substantial litigation \( audio break \) i really think you can win , but there s a serious question about the cost to get there because these are all the things that we would have to do to get there , and it s going to cost youit was millions of dollars that i estimated the client went to another lawyer , who gave them a different evaluation , and they went with that other lawyer my firm lost all that income but the client came back afterwards because the figure i had put on the litigation was exactly what they spent and more settlements are , generally in the business world , economic decisions , balancing both the cost of litigation and the right of the issue but it isbusiness has a different function than courts business function is to do business , to do their work , to sell products , to order relationships and litigation are \( sic \) different as a judge , when i was a district court judge , most of my focus was onbit doing what i used to do as a lawyer , to talk to parties not about the merits of their case , but about the consideration of thinking about creative and new ways to approach a legal dispute so they could avoid the costs of litigation as a circuit court judge , i'm very cognizant of the courtof the cost of litigation and look at what parties are doing in the courts below with thatbearing that in mind sen kaufman howyou know , you talked about your experience as a circuit court judge how did your being a district court judge help you when you became a circuit court judge \? judge sotomayor well , no question that it made me more sensitive to the importance of facts , and looking at the facts the court has found and the facts that the parties are arguing , and looking at the record to understand what went on i often point to this example when i sit on panels in our court , it s blessed by having judges with a wide variety of circumstances and i know , for me , because i was a trial judge , i would read all the briefs in a case i would read the district court s decision and if the parties were arguing something and the district court did n't address it , my first question to my law clerks were , you know , go back to the record and tell me why not most judges address arguments that people areare raising and it wouldi would get to oral argument , and if i was the only judge with a trial experience , i would look at the parties and say , did you argue this before the district court \? \( chuckles \) and i could see some of the antennas going up for those colleagues who had n't had that experience , because they had n't thought of that , let me go back to look in fact if that was the case because there are all sorts of doctrines that do n't permit parties to argue new things on appeal and so that is how the experience comes in , both the sensitivity to facts and the sensitivity to ensure that you 're applying law to those facts sen kaufman i'm really glad you have this commercial experience , because as i said in my opening statement , i'm concerned about business cases i think they 're really important and i'm also concerned that the current court , supreme court , too often seems to disregard settled law and congressional policy choices when it comes to business cases and i think , in light of our economic crisis , congress probably not probably , will definitely pass a financial regulatory reform package and i 'd just like to make sure that the system is not undermined by the court because they just do n't havethey have a different view of what government regulation is all about do you believe the congress has the constitutional authority to regulate financial markets \? judge sotomayor you 've just raised the very first question that will come up when congress passes an act \( laughs , laughter \) because i can assure you , knowing every time congress passes an act , there s a challenge by somebody sen kaufman right judge sotomayor as soon as it s applied to someone in a way that they do n't like , they 're going to come into court so i ca n't answer that question sen kaufman i'm sympathetic to that and i really should have phrased iti mean , just in general , not with regard to any case , anything at allabout congress' constitutional authority to regulate financial markets judge sotomayor well , i ca n't answer that question because it invites an answer toto a potential challenge sen kaufman yeah judge sotomayor what i can say to you is that congress has certain constitutional powers one of them is toto pass laws affecting interstate commerce and so , the question will be the nature of whatever statute congress passes , what facts it relies upon sen kaufman absolutely judge sotomayor and the remedy that it institutes and so , each ofthe question would depend on the nature of the statute and what it s doing sen kaufman but congress does basically have the ability to regulate markets judge sotomayor well , it has the ability tothe constitutional terms are sen kaufman right judge sotomayor to make laws that involve commerce between the states sen kaufman right judge sotomayor but those are the words , and generally that s been interpreted to mean pass laws that affect commercial interstate transactions sen kaufman to get to a more broader question about laws enacted by congress , what should a judge s role be in viewing the wisdom of the statuteplay in interpreting it \? when congress passes a law , what s basicallywhether a judge thinks it s a good law or a bad law , the wisdom in passing itwhat role does that play in the law \? judge sotomayor i'm trying to think if there s any situation in which a judge would have occasion to judge in that way policymaking making of laws is up to congress a judge s personal views as whether that policy choice is good or bad has no role in evaluating congress s choice the question for us is always a different one , which is , what has congress done \? is it constitutional in the manner in which it s done it \? but policy choices are congress s choices in all areas , deference has to be given to that choice sen kaufman how about regulations adopted by regulatory agencies \? judge sotomayor deference has been given in that area by the courts as well generally one looks at what congress has said about that question , because executive agencies have to apply and talk about regulations in light of what congress has commanded but those are also entitled to deference in different factual situations sen kaufman can i talki'm going to talk a few minutes about securities law what s thei mean , what kind ofwhat characterized the securities law docket in the southern district of new york in the 2nd circuit \? judge sotomayor oh , everything we are the home of new york city our jurisdiction isi'm sure that another state is going to complain , but we are the business capital of the world that s how it s been described \( laughs \) by others and so we deal with every variant of securities law as one could imagine , from investment questions to misleading statements to investors to allwhatever congress has regulated , our circuit will have a case on it , or i should say it usually starts with the district courts and it 'll perk up to the circuit court but if you have a securities law , we 'll likely eventually hear the argument sen kaufman and this will be valuable when you 're on the court , when you 'reif you 're confirmed judge sotomayor i presume so , because it has been a part of my work both as a district court and a circuit court judge sen kaufman you had a case with a suit against the new york stock exchange where the plaintiff sued the new york stock exchange for fear it would effectively regulate the market you ruled to give the new york stock exchange immunity from the suit , even though you noted that the alleged misconduct appeared egregious in reaching that sort of decision , how do you reconcile the rationale for immunity with the fact that it deprives plaintiffs of a remedy in situations where they 've been wrongedas you said , egregiously wronged \? judge sotomayor it is somewhat important to recognize the limited role that courts serve and the issue of remedy also is one where one has to talk about remedy against whom and for what in the ways that these individuals were injured , they were injured by third parties who had done allegedly illegal acts against them and the court s ruling did not affect their ability to take action against those individuals and clearly that s always difficult in some situationsif the individual has been arrested , et cetera but there were still remedies that law provideprovides , in terms of whatever assets those individuals have , whatever criminal actions the government may take often funds are created to reimburse victims the question here was whether an agency that in case law was seen to have a quasigovernmental function , whether you could sue that agency for conduct thatfor not regulating the other individuals adequately and helping to prevent the activity but regulation comes in different forms by the government or quasigovernmental agencies and what they can do depends on the exercise of discretion under the laws as they exist at the time and so the immunity doctrine was n't looking at the issue of how to recompense the individuals it was looking at the functionsquasifunctions of government so there s a \( disparate different \? \) perspective that was given to the judges in that case sen kaufman in another securities case that interests me , press versus quick reilly , in that case you and your fellow panel members all deferred to the sec s interpretation of its own regulation , even though you seemed somewhat skeptical of the interpretation tell us about how you came to the conclusion you did in that case judge sotomayor well , there is the doctrine of chevron deference , and it goes to the issue of who makes the decision and that goes to policy questions to the extent that an agency interpretation is notinconsistent with congressional commands , expressed commercial commands , a judge ca n't substitute their own judgment of what policy should be or regulation should be , andbut is commanded to give deference there are obviously , in every situation , a set of exceptions to when you do n't , but you have to then apply a consideration of each of those exceptions in the particular circumstance before you there have been other situations in which i have ruled and said no , the agency is not interpreting the statute in accordance with what the panel viewed was congress s intent yesterday , i believe , one of the other senators asked me about the riverkeeper case sen kaufman yeah judge sotomayor and the supreme court came to a different view of what the words congress used meant but the point is that the role of courts is not to substitute their own judgments it s to apply the principles of law in accordance with the acts that agencies are doing sen kaufman and one more securities question in recent years , it seems like regulators were often too lax when it came to ferreting out securities for fraud what role do private rights of actionthat is , cases brought by investors , rather than the governmenthave in enforcing our securities laws \? judge sotomayor it s a right congress has given , presumably because congress has made a policy choice , that it is a way to ensure that individuals' injuries are remedied that is , it s a part of many of our securities laws and our antitrust laws government does n't have unlimited resources to pursue all individual injuries , and so in some situations congress makes a choice to grant a private cause of action in some it does n't that s a legislative choice sen kaufman turning to antitrust law , what was your experience in antitrust law \? judge sotomayor as a sen kaufman both in practice and a judge , both of them judge sotomayor i'm trying to thinki do n't remember having direct experience in antitrust law when i was in private practice i do n't think \( pause \) i did and so i had very littlei'm trying to think if any of my cases on the district courtand major league baseball strike was one of them \( chuckles \) and it s the one that i can think of i had antitrust cases there , as well often , the cases settled , actually , and so managing those cases was the prime function i had as a district court judge if you 'd give me a chance to look at my district court decisions again , to see ifand what other cases in the antitrust area i may have ruled upon on district court , i can get back to you , senator sen kaufman right judge sotomayor either at the next round or in a written question i just do n't sen kaufman no , that s judge sotomayor on the circuit court , it s different sen kaufman yeah judge sotomayor i have participated directly in writing opinions and joining panels on opinions , and so i 've had at least two , if not three or four or five of those cases sen kaufman yesterday , senator kohl asked about the leegin case , which is striking in that it overturned 96 years of precedent and effectively legalized private agreements to prevent discount retailing you said that both the majority and dissent in that case had a reason to question the economic theory underlying the original precedent i do n't want you to comment on leegin in particular , but what s the role of the court in using economic theory to interpret acts of congress \? judge sotomayor well , you do n't use economic theory to determine the constitutionality of congressional action that is a different question , i think , than the one that leegin s addressed what leegin s addressed was how the court would apply congressional act , the antitrust laws , to a factual question before it and that s a different issue , because that does n't do with questioning the economic choices of congress that goes to whether or notin reviewing the action of a particular defendant , what view the court is going to apply to that activity in the leegin s case , the court s decision was look , we have prior case law that says that this type of activity is always anti competitive and the court , in reconsidering that issue in the leegin s case , said well , there s been enough presented in the courts below to show that maybe it s not in some activities anticompetitive and so we 're not going to subject it to an absolute bar we 're going to subject it to a review under rule of reason that s why i said it s not a question of questioning congress s economic choices or the economic theories that underlay its decisions in a legislation they were n't striking down the antitrust laws what the court was trying to do is to figure out how it would apply that law to a particular set of facts before it sen kaufman in illinois brick , a supreme court case dealing with antitrust lawone of the classic casesjustice white wrote , and i quote , in considering whether to overturn precedent , we must bear in mind that considerations of stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of statutory construction , where congress is free to change this court s interpretation of its legislation do you agree with justice white \? judge sotomayor i think that thatas you may know , the doctrine of stare decisis is not dependent on one factor sen kaufman right judge sotomayor the court considers a variety of different factors , including the administrative workability of a law the reliance factor that society has put into that rule , that precedent the cost to change it whether the underlying doctrines in related areasthe underlying framework of related areas would lead a court to question whether the prior precedent really has a framework that s consistent with an understanding in this area that has been developed in other cases and , finally , has there been a change in society that shows that the factual findings upon which the older case was premised may be wrong \? and there s always the question , as part of that analysis and other factors the courts may think about , as to whether the older rule has been affirmed by the court , and how often over what period of time to the extent that justice white is talking about a factor that the court should put into that mix , the court has recognized in its stare decisis jurisprudence that all of the factors weigh into the decision you 'd think about why and under what circumstances you should alter the course of the court s interpretation ofas set forth in prior precedent sen kaufman you know , i'm concerned , because recently there s been erosion in antitrust , both in the courts and in enforcement and it s made it much easier for financial institutions to become so massive they 're in effect too big to fail should a court sitting on antitrust consider the systemic risk to the marketplace that is injected by a financial institution being too big to fail \? judge sotomayor well , the purpose is theof the antitrust theory is premised on ensuring competition in the marketplace the question , like the one you pose , is one that would come to the court in a particular context , and a challenge to some approach the court has used in this area i obviously ca n't say absolutely yes in a hypothetical sen kaufman no , no judge sotomayor but obviously the court is always looking at what activity is claimed to be illegal under the antitrust laws and what effect it has on anticompetitive behavior and the question frequently in antitrust is , is a particular area subject to per se barring or is it subject to the rule of reason \? and the two have different approaches to the question sen kaufman thank you , judge thank you , mr chairman sen leahy thank you very much , senator kaufman and as i mentioned before , it s almost 1 00 we will take a break until 2 00 at 2 00 we 'll recognize first senator specter and then senator franken when their questions are finished , we will go into the traditional closeddoor session , which will be held not in this room but in the senate judiciary committee room following that , we will come back in here , and if there are senators who have further questions , they 'll be recognized , not to exceed 20 minutes each i would hope that if the question s already been asked and answered , they may want to resist the temptation to do it again but they have that right to take the full 20 minutes if they do i realize a lot of the questions have been asked , but not everybody has asked the same question , and so they may want to but they have that right and that s what we 'll do , and we 'll stand recessed until then \( strikes gavel \) afternoon session sen leahy judge , what 'd you do with your mother \? \( laughter \) judge sotomayor \( laughs \) she needed a short break but it was n't because of senator specter or franken \( chuckles \) sen leahy i had awell , amy klobuchar , i had a nice chat with her this morning she was talking about when she first became a nurse and comparing notes with when my wife did , and both agreed that that s when nurses truly had to be nurses now they 'vethey 're nurses plus , with advances in medicine we willi just discussed this again with senator sessions we 'll go first to senator specter , then to senator franken , and then we will recess and go into the other room for the closed session senator specter , of course , is former chairman of this committee , one of the most senior members of the senate and one of the most experienced senator specter sen arlen specter \( dpa \) thank you , mr chairman welcome back , judge sotomayor you have held up very well with all of the proceedings in the senate , this is the most exacting on the witness years ago , as you know , in the case of ashcraft versus tennessee , they said it was unconstitutional to subject a suspect to a relay grilling but that does n't apply to nominees and your family has been here my wife , joan specter , who s been aan officeholder in her own right , says it s a lot harder to listen to me than it is to make a speech herself and you are engaged i think , beyond doing very well on stamina , you have shown intellect and humor and charm and pride and also modesty so it s been a verya good hearing notwithstanding all of those qualities , the constitution says we have to decide whether to consent and that requires the hearing process and the questions before going into a long list of issues which i have on the agendaseparation of power and wireless wiretaps and secret cia programs , and voting rights , and the americans for disability \( sic \) act , and a woman s right to choose , and the environmental protection agency and the clean war act , and television and the second amendment i 'd like to make an observation or two there has been a lot of talk about a wise latino woman and i think that this proceeding has tended to make a mountain out of a molehill we have had a consistent line of people who are nominees who make references to their own backgrounds we all have our perspective justice o'connor talked about her life experience justice alito talked about his family suffering from ethnic slurs justice thomas , pinpoint , georgia , emphasized , talked about putting himself in the shoes of other people and justice scalia talked about being in a racial minority the expectation would be that a woman would want to say something to assert her competency in a country which denied women the right to vote for decades , where the glass ceiling has limited people , where there is still disparagement of people on ethnic background just this month in a suburb of philadelphia , hispanic children were denied access to a pool for whites only , as were africanamerican children so i can see how someone would take pride in being a latino woman and assertassert herself a lot has been made of the issue of empathy , but that characteristic is not exactly out of place in judicial determinations we 've come a long way on the expansion of constitutional rights oliver wendell holmes' famous statement that the life of the law is experience , not logic justice cardozo , in palko andconnecticut talked about changing values and the warren court changed the constitution practically every day , which i saw , being in the district attorney s office , with changes in search and seizure , confessions , miranda , right to counsel who could have thought that it would take until 1963 to have the right to counsel , in gideon versus wainwright we 've heard a lot of talk about the nomination proceeding of judge bork and they 've tried to make bork into a verb , somebody being borked well , anybody who looks at that record will see that it s very , different we had a situation where judge bork was an advocate of original intent from his days writing the law review article in the indiana law review and how can you have original intent when the 18th amendment was written by a senateon equal protectionwith senate galleries which were segregated or where you have judge bork , who believed that equal protection applied only to race and ethnicity , did n't even apply to women \? but it was a very , very thorough hearing i spent beyond the hearing days , in three long sessions , five hours with judge bork , so it was his own approach to the law which resulted there but you had an evolution of constitutional law , which i think puts empathy in an okay status , in an okay category now on to the issues i begin with an area of cases which the court has decided not to decide and those cases can be even more important than many of the cases which the court decides the docket of the court at the present time is very different from it was a century ago in 1886 the docket had 1 , 396 cases , decided 451 a hundred years later there were only 161 signed opinions in 1985 2007 , only 67 signed opinions during his confirmation hearings chief justice roberts said the court , quote , could contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more cases judge sotomayor , do you agree with that statement by chief justice roberts \? judge sotomayor i know , senator specter , that there is questions by many people , including senators and yourself , of justice roberts and other nominees about this issue can the court take on more \? to the extent that there s concern about itnot that public opinion should drive the justices to take more cases just to take them , but i think what judgejustice roberts was saying is , the court needs to think about its processes to ensure that it s fulfilling its obligations sen specter judge sotomayor , how about more cases \? judge sotomayor well , perhaps i need to explain to you that i do n't like making statements about what i think the court can do until i 've experienced the process sen specter then let me move on to another question judge sotomayor \( chuckles \) sen specter one case that the court did not take involved the terrorist surveillance program , which i think arguably posed the greatest conflict between congressional powers under article i in enacting the foreign intelligence surveillance act , which provided for the exclusive way to get wiretaps the president disregarded that in a secret program called the terrorist surveillance program did n't even tell the chairman of the judiciary committee , which is the required practice , or accepted practice did n't tell the intelligence committees , where the law mandates that they be told about such programs was only disclosed by the new york times those practices confront us this day , with reports about many other secret cases not disclosed the federal district court in detroit found the terrorist surveillance program unconstitutional sixth circuit , in a 2to1 opinion , said there was no standing the dissent , i think , pretty conclusively had the much better of it on asserting standing the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari , did n't even take up the case to the extent of deciding whether it should n't take it because of lack of standing i wrote you a letter about thiswrote a series of letters , and gave you advance notice that i would ask you about this case i'm not asking you how you would decide the case but would n't you agree that the supreme court should have taken that kind of a major conflict on separation of powers \? judge sotomayor i know it must be very frustrating to you to sen specter it sure is i was the chairman who was n't notified judge sotomayor no , i'm sure sen specter she was the ranking member who was n't notified judge sotomayor i can understand not only congress s or your personal frustration , and sometimes of citizens , when there are important issues that they would like the court to consider the question becomes what do i do , if you give me the honor to serve on the courtif i say something today , is that going to make a statement about how i'm going to prejudge someone else s sen specter i'm not asking you to prejudge i 'd like to know your standards for taking the case if you have that kind of a monumental historic conflict , when the court is supposed to decide conflicts between the executive and legislative branches , how can it possibly be justified not to take that case \? judge sotomayor there are often , from what i understandand that s from my review of supreme court actions and cases of situations in which they have or have not taken cases , and i 've read some of their reasoning as to this i know that with some important issues , they want to make sure that there is n't a procedural bar to the case of some type that would take away from whether they were in fact doing what they would want to do , which is to address the sen specter well , was there a procedural bar \? you 've had weeks to mull that over , because i gave you notice judge sotomayor senator , i'm sorry i did mull this over my problem is that without looking at a particular issue and considering the cert briefs file , the discussion of potential colleagues as to the reasons why a particular issue should or should not be considered , the question about sen specter well , i can tell you 're not going to answer let me move on on a woman s right to choose , circuit judge luttig in the case of richmond medical center said that casey versus planned parenthood was superstaredecisis do you agree with judge luttig \? judge sotomayor i do n't use the word super i do n't know how to take that word all precedent of the court is entitled to the respect of the doctrine of stare decisis sen specter do you think that roe versus wade has added weight on stare decisis to protect a woman s right to choose , by virtue of casey versus planned parenthood , as judge luttig said \? judge sotomayor that is one of the factors that i believe courts have used to consider the issue of whether or not a new direction should be taken in the law there is a variety of different factors the court uses , not just one sen specter but that is one which would give it extra weight how about the fact that the supreme court of the united states has had 38 cases after roe versus wade where it could have reversed roe versus wade \? would that add weight to the impact of roe versus wade on stare decisis to guarantee a woman s right to choose \? judge sotomayor the history of a particular holding of the court and how the court has dealt with it in subsequent cases would be among one of the factors of many that a court would likely consider each situation , however , is considered in a variety of different viewpoints and arguments andbut most importantly factors that the court applies to this question of should precedents be altered in a way sen specter well , would n't 38 cases lend a little extra support to the impact of roe and casey , where the court had the issue before , could have overruled it \? judge sotomayor in casey itself sen specter just a little extra impact \? judge sotomayor casey itself applied orbut an opinion authored by justice souter talked about the factors that a court thinks about in whether to change precedent , and among them were issues of whether or notor how much reliance society has placed in the prior precedent what are the costs that would be occasioned by changing it was the rule workable or not have the either factual or doctrinal basis of the prior precedent altered , either from developments in related areas of law or not , to counsel a reexamination of a question and sen specter i'm going to move ongo ahead judge sotomayor and the court has considered in other cases the number of times the issue has arisen and what actions the court has or not taken with respect to that roe is theroecasey did reaffirm the core holding of roe , and so my understanding would be that the issue would be addressed in light of casey on the stare decisis effect sen specter do i hear you saying there would be at least a little bit of extra weight \? judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen specter let me move onlet me move on to another separation of powers argument , and that is between congress and the court in 1997 , in a case called boerne , suddenly the supreme court of the united states founded a new test called congruence and proportionality up to that time , judge harlan s judgment on a rational basis for what congress would decide would be sufficient and here , for the benefit of our television audience , we 're talking about a record that the congress maintains take the americans with disabilities act , for example , where there was a task force of field hearings in every state , attended by more than 30 , 000 people , including thousands who had experienced discrimination , with roughly 300 examples of discrimination by state governments notwithstanding that last record , the supreme court of the united states , in alabama versus garrett , found title ii of the americans with disabilities act unconstitutional justice scalia , in dissent , said that it was a , quote , flabby test , that it was , quote , an invitation to judicial arbitrariness and policydriven decisionmaking the other , title i of the americans with disabilities act , in lane versus tennessee , the court found it constitutional , on the same record in a second round , if we have time , i will ask yougive you some advance noticealthough i wrote you about these casesif you can find a distinction on the supreme court s determination but my question to you is , looking at this brand new standard of proportionality and congruence , for whatever those words meanand if we have time in the second round , i 'll ask you to define it , but there are other questions i want to come to youdo you agree with justice scalia that it s a flabby test and that , with having such a vague standard , the court can do anything it wants and really engages in policydriven decisionmakingwhich means the court , in effect , legislates \? judge sotomayor senator , the question of whether i agree with a view of a particular justice or not is not something that i can say in terms of the next case in the next case that the court will look at , and a challenge to particular congressional statute sen specter well , not the next case , this case you have these two cases they have the same factual record and the supreme court , in effect , legislates , tells us what is right and what is wrong on this standard that nobody can understand judge sotomayor as i understand the congruence and proportionality test , it is the supreme court s holding on that test , as i understand it , that there is an obligation on the court to ensure that congress is workingworkingis legislating within its legislative powers the issue is notand these are section 5 cases , essentially , which are the clause of the constitution under the 14th amendment that permits congress to legislate on issues involving violations of the 14th amendmentthe court in those cases has not said that congress ca n't legislate what it has looked at is the form of remedy congress can order and what sen specter but it does n't tell us how to legislate let me move on to a voting rights act case and just pose the case and we 'll ask you about it in the next round when chief justice roberts testified in his confirmation hearings , he was very deferential to the congressnot so , i might add , when he decided the voting rights case but when he appeared here three years ago , he said this , and it s worth reading i appreciate very much the differences with institutional competence between the judiciary and the congress when it comes to basic questions of factfinding , development of a record and also the authority to make the policy decisions about how to act on the basis of a particular record it s not just disagreement over a record it s the question of whose job it is to make a determination based on the record as a judge , you may have the beginning to transgress into the area of making a law is when you are in a position of reevaluating legislative findings , because that does n't look like a judicial function well , that s about as deferential as you can be when you 're a nominee but when chief justice roberts presided over the votingrights case , he sounded very , very different my question to you is , do you agree with what chief justice roberts said when he was just judge roberts , that it s an area of making laws to transgress into what congress has done by way of finding the facts \? judge sotomayor i would find it difficult to agree with someone else s words i can tell you how much i understand the deference that congress is owed , and i can point to youat least to two cases , and there are many , many more , that shows how much i value the fact that we are courts that must give deference to congress in the fields that are within its constitutional power sen specter well , do you agree with chief justice roberts \? i sent you that quotation a long time ago and told you i 'd ask you about it do you agree with him or not \? judge sotomayor i agree to the extent that one s talking about the deference that congress is owed i ca n't speak for what he intended to say by that i can speak to what i sen specter well , not what he intended to say what he did say judge sotomayor i heard what he said , sir , but i do n't know what he intended in that description i do know what iwhat i can say , which is that i do understand the importance to congress s factual findings , that my cases and my approach in my cases reflect that i 've had any number of cases where the question was deference to congressional findings , and i have upheld statutes because of that deference sen specter is there anything the senate or congress can do if a nominee says one thing seated at that table and does something exactly the opposite once they walk across the street \? judge sotomayor that , in fact , is one of the beauties of our constitutional system , which is sen specter beauty in the judge sotomayor that we do have a separation of powers sen specter beauty in the eyes of the beholder \( laughter \) it s only constitution avenue there \( laughter \) judge sotomayor well , the only advantage you have in my case is that i have a 17year record that i think demonstrates how i approach the law , and the deference with whichor the deference i give to the other branches of government sen specter i think your record is exemplary , judge sotomayor , exemplary i'm not commenting about your answers , but your record is exemplary judge sotomayor \( chuckles \) \( laughter \) sen specter let meand you 'll be judged more on your record than on your answers , judge sotomayor \( chuckles \) and for those who are uninitiated , your preparation , appropriately , is very careful they call them murder boards at the white house i do n't know what you did , and i'm not asking we 've had a lot of commentary and you studied the questions and you studied the record , and your qualifications as a witness is terrific in accordance with the precedence there you 're following the precedence there very closely let me move to television in the courts and it s a question that many of us are interested in i always ask , and i 've introduced legislation twice , come out of committee twice , to require the court to televise court does n't have to listen to congress the court can say separation of powers precludes our saying anything but the congress does have administrative procedural jurisdiction we decide the court convenes the first monday in october we decide there are nine justices we had tried to make it 15 once in the courtpacking era six justices for a quorum , et cetera speedy trial act telling the courts how they have to move at a certain speed habeas corpus on time limits justice stevens has has said that it s worth a try justice ginsburg at one time said that if it was gaveltogavel , it would be fine justice kennedy said it was inevitable the record of the justices appearing on television is extensive chief justice roberts and justice stevens were on primetime abc , justice ginsburg on cbs , justice breyer on fox news , and so forth down the line we all know that the senate and the house are televised , and we all know the tremendous , tremendous interest in your nominating process and it happens all the time there s a lot of public interest but the court is the least accountable in fact , you might say the court is unaccountable when bush versus gore was decided , thensenator biden and i wrote to chief justice rehnquist asking that television be permitted got back a prompt answer , no and that was quite a scene across the street the television trucks were just enormous , all over the place you had to be the chairman of a committee to get a seat inside the chamber the supreme court decides all the cuttingedge questions of the day the right of a woman to choose abortion , the death penalty , organized crime , every cuttingedge question and bush versus gore was probably the biggestwas one of the biggest cases , arguably the biggest case more than a hundred million people voted in that election , and the presidency was decided by one vote and justice scalia had this to say about irreparable harm the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to referring to president bush , or candidate bush and to the country by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of the election permitting the court to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an account an accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later it s hard to understand what recount there was going to be later i wrote about it at the time , saying that i thought it was an atrocious accounting of irreparable harm , hard to calculate , hard to calculate that and my question , judge sotomayor should n't the american people have access to what is happening in the supreme court , to try to understand it , to have access to what the judges do by way of their workload , by way of their activities when they adjourn in june and reconvene in october , this year in september \? would n't it be more appropriate in a democracy to let the people take a look inside the court through television \? the supreme court said in the richmond newspapers case decades ago that it was n't just the accused that had a right to a public trial , it was the press and the public , as well and now it s more than newspapers television is really paramount why not televise the court \? judge sotomayor as you know , when there have been options for me to participate in cameras in the courtroom , i have and as i said to you when we met , senator , i will certainly relay those positive experiences if i become fortunate enough to be there to discuss it with my colleagues and that question is an important one , obviously there s legislation being considered both byor has been considered by congress at various times , and there s much discussion between the branches on that issue it is an ongoing dialogue it is important to remember that the court , because of this issue , has , over time , made public the transcripts of its hearings quicker and quicker if i'm accurate now , it used to take a long time for them to make those transcripts available , and now they do it before the end of the day it s an ongoing process of discussion sen specter thank you , judge sotomayor thank you , mr chairman sen leahy \( off mike \) much , senator specter and then the last of ourthis round of questioning will be senator franken , the newest member of the committee senator , i did n't officially welcome you the other day , as i should have when we have new members but welcome sen al franken \( dmn \) well , thank sen leahy welcome to the committees \( sic \) i offer you congratulations and condolences at the same time \( laughter \) to come in when the sen franken i 'll take the congratulations sen leahy okay well , then , ithat was most heartfelt i'm glad you 're here please go ahead sen franken well , thank you , mr chairman and thank you , judge sotomayor , for sitting here so patiently and for all your thoughtful answers throughout the hearing before lunch , our senior senator from minnesota , amy klobuchar , asked you why you became a prosecutor , and you mentioned perry mason i was a big fan of perry mason i watched perry mason every week with my dad and my mom and my brother and we 'd watch the clock , and whenwe knew , when it was two minutes to the halfhour , that the real murderer would stand up and confess judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen franken it was a great show and it amazes me that you wanted to become a prosecutor based on that show , because in perry mason the prosecutor , burger , lost every week \( laughter \) judge sotomayor one \( case \? \) \( chuckles \) sen franken with one exception , which we 'll get to later judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen franken but i think that says something about your determination to defy the odds and while you were watching perry mason in the south bronx with your mom and your brother , andi wasi was watching perry mason in suburban minneapolis with my folks and my brother and here we are today and i'mi'm asking you questions because you have been nominated to be a justice of the united states supreme court i think that s pretty cool \( laughter \) as i said in my opening statement , i see these proceedings both as a way to take a judgment of you and of any nominee s suitability for the high court , but also as a way for americans to learn about the court and its impact on their lives right now , people are getting more and more of their information on the internet getting newspapers and television , blogs and radio americans are getting all of it online and it plays a central role in our democracy , by allowing anyone with a computer connected to the internet to publish their ideas , their thoughts , their opinions , and reach a worldwide audience of hundreds of millions of people in seconds this is free speech , and this is essential to our democracy , and to democracy we saw this in iran not long ago now , judge , you 're familiar with the supreme court s 2005 brand x decision are you \? judge sotomayor i am sen franken okay well , then you know that brand x deregulated internet access services , allowing service providers to act as gatekeepers to the internet , even though the internet was originally governmentfunded and built on the notion of common carriage and openness in fact , we 've already seen examples of these companies blocking access to the web and discriminating on certain uses of the internet this trend threatens to undermine the greatest engine of free speech and commerce since the printing press let s say you 're living in duluth , minnesota , and you only have one internet service provider it s a big , megacorporation and not only are they the only internet service provider , but they 're also a content provider they provide they own newspapers they own tv networks theyor network they have a movie studio they decide to speed up their own content and slow down other content the brand x decision by the supreme court allows them to do this and this is n't just duluth it s moorhead , minnesota it s rochester , minnesota it s youngstown , ohio it s denver it s san francisco and yes , it s new york this is frighteningfrightening to me and to millions of my constituents , or lots of my constituents internet connections use public resources the public airways , public rights of way does n't the american public have a compelling first amendment interest in ensuring that this ca n't happen and that the internet stays open and accessiblein other words , that the internet stays the internet \? judge sotomayor many described the telephone as a revolutionary invention and it did change our country dramatically so did television and itsregulation of television and the rules that would apply to it were considered by congress and those regulations havebecause congress is the policychooser on how items related to interstate commerce and communications operate and that issue was reviewed by the courts in the context of the policy choices congress made there is no question in my mind , as a citizen , that the internet has revolutionized communications in the united states and there s no question that access to that is a question that society isthat our citizens as well as yourself are concerned about but the role of the court is never to make the policy it s to wait till congress acts and then determine what congress has done and its constitutionality in light of that ruling brand x , as i understood it , was a question of which government agency would regulate those providers and the court , looking at congress s legislation in these two areas , determined that it thought it fit in one box , not the other , one agency instead of another sen franken is this title i and title ii , or as i understand it , title ii is subject to a lot of regulation , and title i is n't judge sotomayor exactly but the question was not so much stronger regulation or not stronger regulation it was which set of regulations , given congress s choice , control obviously , congress may think that the regulations the court has in its holding interpreted congress s intent and that congress thinks the court got it wrong we 're talking about statutory interpretation and congress s ability to alter the court s understanding by amending the statute if it chooses this is not to say that i minimize the concerns you express access to internet , given its importance in everything todaymost businesses depend on it , most individuals find their information the children in my life virtually live on it now and so it s importance implicates a lot of different questionsfreedom of speech , freedom with respect to property rights , government regulation there s just so many issues that get implicated by the internet that what the court can do is not choose the policy it just has to go by interpreting each statute and trying to figure out what congress intends sen franken i understand that but is n't there a compelling first amendment right here for people , no matter what congress does \? and i would urge my colleagues to take this up and write legislation that i would like , but is n't there a compelling , overriding first amendment right here for americans to have access to the internet \? judge sotomayor rights by a court are not looked at as overriding , in the sense that i think a citizen and notor a citizen would think about it should this go first or should a competing right go second rights are rights , and what the court looks at is how congress balanced those rights in a particular situation and then judges where thatwhether that balance is within constitutional boundaries holding one more compelling than the other suggests that there s sort ofyou know , property interests are less important than first amendment interests that s not the comparison a court makes the comparison a court makes starts with what balances congress choose first , and that we 'll look at that if itand see if it s constitutional sen franken okay so we got some work to do on this i want to get into judicial activism i brought this up in my opening statement as i see it , there s kind of an impoverishment of our political discourse when it comes to the judiciary i'm talking in politics when candidates or officeholders talk about thewhat kind of judge they want , it s very often just reduced to i do n't want an activist judge i do n't want a judge that s going to legislate and that s sort of it that s it it s a 30second sound bite as i and a couple of other senators mentioned during our opening statements , judicial activism has become a code word for judges that you justyou do n't agree with judge , what is your definition of judicial activism \? judge sotomayor it s not a term i use i do n't use the term because i do n't describe the work that judges do in that way i assume the good faith of judges in their approach to the law , which is that each one of us is attempting to interpret the law according to principles of statutory construction and other guiding legal principles , and to come in good faith to an outcome that we believe is directed by lawwhen i say we believe , hopefully if we all go through the processes of reasoning it out and coming to a conclusion in accordance with the principles of law i think you 're right that one of the problems with this process is that people think of activism as the wrong conclusion in light of policy but hopefully judgesand i know that i do n't approach judging in this way at allare not imposing policy choices inor their views of the world or their views of how things should be done that would be judicial activism , in my sense , if a judge was doing something improper like that but i do n't use that word , because that s something different than what i consider to be the process of judging , which is each judge coming to each situation , trying to figure out what the law means applying it to the particular fact before that judge sen franken okay you do n't use that word , or that phrase but in political discourse about the role of the judiciary , that s almost the only phrase that s ever used and i think that there has been an ominous increase in what i consider judicial activism , of late and i want to ask you about a few cases , and see if you can shed some light on this for us and for the people watching at home or in the office i want to talk about northwest austin \( municipal \) utility district number one v holder , the recent voting rights act case and senator cardin mentioned it , but he did n't get out hishis pocket constitution , as i am the 15th amendment was passed after the civil war it specifically gave congress the authority to pass laws to protect all citizens' right to vote and it said , section 1 amendment number 15 , section 1 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude section 2 , and this one is important the congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation the congress well , congress used that power tothe power vested in it under section 2 , when it passed the voting rights act of 1965 now , the voting rights act has an especially strong provision , section 5 , that requires states with a history of discrimination to get preapproval from the justice department on any changes that they make in their voting regulations congress has reauthorized this four times , as recently asthe last time was 2006 and the senate supported it by a vote of 98to0 every single senator from a state covered by section 5 voted to reauthorize it so now it s 2009 and we have this case , northwest austin \( sic municipal \) utility district number one , and justice thomas votes to hold section v unconstitutional he said it went beyond the mandate of the fifteenth amendment because it was n't necessary anymore that s what he said now , when i read the fifteenth amendment , it does n't sayit does n't contain any limits on congress s power it just says that we have it it does n't say , if necessary , the congress shall have power to enforce this article it just says that we have the power so it is my understanding that the fifteenth amendment contains a very strong , very explicit and unambiguous grant of power to the congress and because of that , the courts should pay greater deference to it and my question is , is that your view \? judge sotomayor as you know , some of the justices in that recent decision expressed the view that the court should take up the constitutionality of the voting rights act and review of its continuing necessity justice thomas expressed his view that very question , given the decision and the fact that it left that issue open , is a very clear indication that that s a question that the courts are going to be addressingif not immediately the supreme court , certainly the lower courts and so expressing a view agreeing with one person in that decision or another would suggest that i have made a prejudgment on this question sen franken so judge sotomayor i consider it sen franken that means you 're not going to tell us \( laughter \) i did n't mean to finish your sentence i think i knew where you were going judge sotomayor no , no , no , no all i can say to you is , i have one decisionamong many , but one decision on the voting rights act , and not the recent reauthorization by congress , but a prior amendment , where i suggested that these issues neededissues of changes in the voting rights act should be left to congress in the first instance my jurisprudence shows the degree to which i give deference to congress s findings whether in a particular situation that compels or does n't or leads to a particular result , is not something that i can opine on sen franken \( naturally \? \) judge sotomayor because particularly the issue you 're addressing right now is likely to be considered by the courts the aba rule says no judge should make comments on the merits of any of any pending or impending case and this clearly would be an impending case sen franken okay but it s fair to say , though , in your own decision , you gave deference to congress just like the answer to my netneutrality thing , saying it s up to congress judge sotomayor well sen franken it feels like this is very explicitly up to congress judge sotomayor i gave deference to the exact language that congress had used in the voting rights act in how it applied to a challenge in that case sen franken okay now , voting to overturn federal legislation , to me , at least , seems to be one definition of what people understand as judicial activism but i want to talk about some cases that ii 've seen that i think showed judicial activism functioning on a more pernicious level first , let s take a look at a case called gross v fbl financial services that the supreme court issued last month are you familiar with that \? judge sotomayor i am sen franken okay now , gross involved the age discrimination employment act , or adea now , before gross , you could bring an agediscrimination suit whenever you could show that age was one of the factors an employer considered in choosing to fire you when the supreme court agreed to hear the case , it said it would consider just one question whether you needed direct evidence of age discrimination to bring this kind of lawsuit or whether indirect evidence would suffice that s the issue that they said that they would consider when they took the case but when the supreme court handed down its decision , it ruled on a much larger matter , whether a worker could bring a suit under adea if age was only one of several reasons for being demoted or fired the supreme court barred these suits , saying that only suits alleging that age was the determinative factor for the firing , only those could be brought under the adea this change has significantly eroded workers' rights by making it much harder for workers to defend themselves from age discrimination , including getting fired just before they would have seen a large increase in their pensionyou were n't fired for you 're too old you 're fired because your pension is going to increase soon so this is a big deal when you go to court to defend your rights , you haveyou have to know what rights you 're defending the parties in the gross case thought they were talking about what kind of evidence was necessary in a discrimination suit then the court just said no , we 're banning that kind of suit altogether i think that s unfair to everyone involved it s especially unfair to the man who was trying to bring the discrimination suit so let me ask you a couple questions on this first , as an appellate court judge , how often have you decided a case on an argument or a question that the parties have not briefed \? \( pause \) judge sotomayor i do n't think i have , because to the extent that the parties have not raised an issue , and the circuit court for some reason the panel has thought that it was pertinent , most often that happens on questions of jurisdictioncan the court hear this case at all \? then you issue or we have issued a direction to the parties to brief that question , so it is briefed and part of the argument that s raised there are issues that the parties brief thatthat the briefing itself raises the issue for the court to consider so it s generally the practice , at least on the 2nd circuitis to give a party an opportunity to be heard on a question and we also have a procedure on the circuit that would give a party to be heard , because they can also file the petitions for rehearing , which is the panel enters a decision that the party disagrees with and thinks the court has not given it an adequate opportunity to present its argument sen franken well judge sotomayor then it can file that at the circuit i do n't havei am familiar with the northwest case i am familiar with the holding of that case i'm a little less familiar and have n'tdid n't pay as much attention sen franken with gross judge sotomayor to the briefing issue i do know there that like the brand x case , what the court says it was attempting to do is to discern what congress s intent was under the ada \( sic \) , whether it intended to consider mixed motive or not as a factor in applying the statute and the majority holding , as i understood it , was , look , congress amended title vii to set forth the mixed motive framework and directed the courts to apply that framework in the future but having amended that , it did n't apply that amendment to the age discrimination statute and so that would end up in a similar situation to the brand x case , which is , to the extent that congress determines that it does want mixed motive to be a part of that analysis , that it would have the opportunity , and does have the opportunity , to do what it did in title vii , which is to amend the act sen franken well , in title vii , they amended the act because they had to they were forced to , right \? congress was impelled to , in a sense judge sotomayor ii sen franken but not on adea judge sotomayor ii do n't like characterizing the reasons for why congress acts or does n't act \( chuckles \) sen franken okay i got you let me jump ahead to something yesterday , a member of this committee asked you a few times whether the word abortion appears in the constitution and you agreed that , no , the word abortion is not in the constitution are the words birth control in the constitution \? judge sotomayor no , sir sen franken are you sure \? judge sotomayor yes \( laughter \) sen franken okay are the words privacy in the constitutionor the word \? judge sotomayor the word privacy is not sen franken mmhmm senators kohl , feinstein and cardin all raised the issue of privacy , but i want to hit this headon do you believe that the constitution contains a fundamental right to privacy \? judge sotomayor it contains , as has been recognized by the courts for over 90 years , certain rights under the liberty provision of the due process clause that extend to the right to privacy in certain situations this line of cases started with a recognition that parents have a right to direct the education of their children , and that the state could not force parents to send their children to public schools or to bar their children from being educated in ways a state found objectionable obviously , states do regulate the content of education , at least in terms of requiring certain things with respect to education that i do n't think the supreme court has considered but the basicthat basic right to privacy has been recognized , and was recognized and there have been other decisions sen franken so the issue of whether a word actually appears in the constitution is not really relevant , is it \? judge sotomayor certainly there are some very specific words in the constitution that have to be given direct application there are some direct commands by the constitution you know , senators have to be a certain age to be senators and so you got to do what those words say but the constitution is written in broad terms , and what a court does is then look at how those terms apply to a particular factual setting before it sen franken okay in roe v wade , the supreme court found that the fundamental right to privacy included the right to decide whether or not to have an abortion and as senator specter said , that s been upheld or ruled on many times do you believe that this right to privacy includes the right to have an abortion \? judge sotomayor the court has said , in many cases , and as i think has been repeated in the court s jurisprudence in casey , that there is a right to privacy that women have with respect to the termination of their pregnancies in certain situations sen franken okay iwe 're going to have round two , so i 'll ask you some more questions there what was the one case in perry mason \? \( pause \) that berger won judge sotomayor i wish i remembered the name of the episode , but i do n't i just was always struck that there was only one case where his client was actually guilty and sen franken and you do n't remember that case \? judge sotomayor i know that i should remember the name of it , but i have n't looked at the episode i sen franken did n't the white house prepare you for \( laughter \) for that \? judge sotomayor you 're right , but i was spending a lot of time on reviewing cases \( laughs \) sen franken okay judge sotomayor no , sir but i do have that stark memory because , like you , i watched it all of the time , every week , as well i just could n't interest my mother the nurse and my brother the doctor to do it with me sen franken oh oh , okay well , iweour whole family watched it andbecause there was no internet at the time , you and i were watching at the same time and i thank you , and i guess i 'll talk to you in the followup judge sotomayor thank you sen leahy is the senator from minnesota going to tell us which episode that was \? sen franken i do n't know \( laughter \) that s why i was asking sen leahy oh sen franken if i knew , i would n't have asked her \( laughter \) sen leahy all right so because of that , judge , we will not hold your inability to answer the question against you \( laughter \) judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen leahy now , on one of thei just discussed this with senator sessions , but i 'll make the formal request is there any objection to the committee now proceeding to a closed session , which is a routine practice we 've followed for every nominee since back when senator biden was chairman of this committee \? sen sessions mr chairman , thank you i think that s the right thing to do and there will be no objection that i know of sen leahy thank you very much i appreciate that comment and so , hearing none , the committee will proceed to a closed session and we will resume public hearings later this afternoon and for the sake of those who have to handle all the electronic kind of things , we 'll try to give you enough of a headsup we 'll stand in recess \( recess \) sen leahy \( in progress \) that can be exercised judge sotomayor that is a part of the holding of gideon it has been reaffirmed in terms of the right to counselnot only the right to counsel in the representation of criminal issues , but the court has recognized that right with respect to a competent counsel the question of whether incompetent counsel has caused a defendant damage is assessed under a legal standard but the question is , the right to counsel was the court holding of gideon sen leahy if aif the constitution guarantees a person the ability to exercise a certain fundamental constitutional right , or whatever it might be , and if they saythe court says they 're guaranteed that right , these rights are only meaningful if an american can then enforce those rights in a court is that not correct \? judge sotomayor their rights are meaningful , and they are rights that we work at ensuring are given meaning in the courts i know for a fact that one of the activitiesknow for a fact i know because i lived itwhen i became a judge on the 2nd circuit , i was given responsibility for the 2nd circuit s committee on the criminal justice act and pro bono service generally , thatthe chair of that committee is the most recent addition to the court , and immediately upon the confirmation of another judge , that judge takes over the chairpersonship i , because of my belief in the meaningfulness of representation and its importance to the justice system , have held that position probably for the longest judge \( chuckles \) in the 2nd circuit with the agreement of judges who came after me , i served as the chair of that committee i do n't knowremember exactly the number of years , but it was certainly a very long period of time and i worked very hard to improve both the processes of selection of criminal justice act attorneysthose are the attorneys that represent indigent defendants in criminal actionsand to ensure that there was adequate review of their qualifications and regular review of their performance sen leahy i do n't want to put words in your mouth , but is it safe to say that if you have a constitutional right , as a practical effect , that only works if you can enforce that constitutional right \? judge sotomayor clearly , that sin terms of theit s given meaning through actions , and actions by the legislature who have provided funds for the retention of qualified counsel and the court s obligation to ensure that that right is meaningful sen leahy thank you i 've used judge sotomayor in practice sen leahy i 've used just barely over half my time i 'll reserve time senator sessions and i hope that sets an example sen jeff sessions \( ral \) i'm impressed , mr chairman thank you and you know , we talked a little earlier about judicial activism senatorour new senator raised that we have a good definition our former chairman , senator hatch , he s given us a definition for a number of years , and that is when a judge allows their personal , political or other biases to overcome their commitment to the rule of law that s not as well as he said it , but that s pretty close \? sen orrin hatch \( rut \) \( off mike \) sen sessions i think \( laughs \) but i think that sand you can have , senator franken , a liberal or a conservative activist judge and judges need to be watched , as we all do , to make sure that they stay faithful to the law i really believe in this legal system i think it s so fabulous i 've traveled the world with the armed services committee and i see these countriesit just breaks your heart you think you can go in and write up code of law and they can make it work and it s just you can write them all day , but itmaking it actually be real in every village , hamlet and farm and city in these countries is so , so hard we are so blessed so i just want to say , judge , i appreciate you and i look forward to questioning andbut i justmy approach is to try to do the best thing we can for america and this fabulous system we 've got i we 'vei think our side is committed to being fair and throughout this hearing , and try to be thoughtful in our questions nobody s perfect , but i think everybody s done a pretty good job at that now , i 've listened to your testimony carefully , looked at some transcripts , and i have to say i'm still concerned about some of the issues that have been raised and you 're seeking a lifetime appointment this is the one chance we have to ask those questions , and we must do that with regard to thethe wise latina quote , where you said that they should make decisions that are better than a white male , you and the question of justice o'connor s comment about a wise , old woman and a wise , old man shouldwould reach the same conclusion i would just say there s a difference both may well be a rhetorical flourish or rhetorical approach to stating a truth , but i think justice o'connor s approach and truth was that judges , under the american ideal , should reach the same decision , if they can put aside all their biases and prejudices and you seem to say in your approach , and throughout that speech , that backgrounds , sympathies and prejudices can impact how you rule , and you could expect a different outcome how would you respond to that \? judge sotomayor senator , i want to give you complete assurance that i agree with senator hatch on his definition of activism if that s his definition , that judges should not be using their personal biases , their personal experiences , their personal prejudices , in reaching decision , and that s how he defines activism , then i'm in full agreement with him to the extent that my words have led some to believe that i think a particular group hashasis better than another in reaching a decision based on their experiences , my rhetorical device failed it failed because it left an impression that i believe something that i do n't and as i have indicated , it was a bad choice of words by me , because it left an impression that has offended people , and has left an impression that i did n't intend as i indicated earlier , i had sen sessions but did it notcould i just briefly interrupt \? did it not suggest that your approach to the question of objectivity , and commitment to it , was different than justice o'connor s \? did n't you cite it in opposition to her view \? judge sotomayor as ii can explain it is that i did n't understand her to mean that she thought that if two judges reached a different conclusion , that one of them was unwise , because , as judges disagree as to conclusionsand i know that there s an aspiration that the law would be so certain that that would never happen , but it s not that certain laws are not written clearly , on occasion , by congress courts apply principles of construction that suggest an approach to a particular set of facts that might differ all of that does n't make or the other judge wise so sen sessions i would agree with that , and i think one judge you can have honest disagreements i think that she was expressing the ideal that if everybody were perfectly wise , they may reach the same decision with regard to the second amendment , this is a hugely important issue is n't it true , judge , that the decision that you and your panel rendered , if it were to be the law of the united states , and if it is not reversed by the us supreme court , would say that the second amendment is subject tois notthe second amendment does not protect the right of the people to keep and bear arms in any city , county and state in america \? that is , that new york or atlanta or philadelphia or houston or los angeles or any state in between could pass a law that barred firearms within those states and is n't this a really big issue right now for the united states supreme court , coming up soon \? judge sotomayor it may well come up and i'm not familiar enough with the regulations in all 50 states to know whether there s an absolute prohibition in any one city or state against the possession of firearms all i can speak about is that as in the case the panel looked at , the question for the court would not be whether the government action in isolation is constitutional or not the questionin isolation it would be what s the nature of the government interest in the statute it s passing , and depending on sen sessions that s the rational basis test \? judge sotomayor exactly and so sen sessions well , but the rational basis test could very well be fairly interpreted to say that , since guns kill people , it s rational for a city to vote to eliminate all guns i would just say to you , is n't it true that if a city could pass that very low test , they could ban firearms if your decision is not reversed by the supreme court \? judge sotomayor because that question of incorporation before the court will arise , i do n't feel that i can comment on the merits of a hypothetical all i can say is , regardless of what standard of review the court uses , it has struck down regulations under every standard of review used , whether it s rational basis or , in some instances , strict scrutiny , et cetera there is the constitutional sen sessions but , judge , i would just say that you heldand following some law in the 1800s , you held , though , that the second amendment does not apply to the states , even though it uses the words the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed so i'mi think we have athis is a big issue and in your opinion , you said it was settled law you used some very strong language you said it was not a fundamental right and you said that in your testimony earlier that in supreme court parlance , the right is not fundamental you said that , i believe , to senator leahy in this hearing so i guess i'mmy question is , have you made up your mind such that if you were on the supreme court and it was not your case that came upand it could be your casedo youdo n't you feel that you should recuse yourself , since you 've already opined on this fundamental issue \? judge sotomayor i have not prejudged the question that the supreme court left open in heller and the question the court left open itself was should it reexamine the issue of whether this right should be incorporated against the states or not it did n't in large measure because the issue before the court at that moment was the right with respect to federal government regulation i have not made up my mind i did n't say that i believed it was n't fundamental or that i hold a view that it s not i do n't hold a view about whether it should be incorporated or not the issue before me and the panel in maloney was whether the supreme court had said that and what 2nd circuit had said about that issue sen sessions did any other circuit say it was not a fundamental right , other than your panel s decision \? judge sotomayor there is one circuit , the 7th circuit , in a decision written by judge easterbrook , who came to the same conclusion sen sessions did he saydid he say it was anot a fundamental right , though , in that opinion \? i do n't believe they did judge sotomayor he may not have , because sen sessions but that was the question thatmy question i was asking so it s a problem for people when you ask about abortion , it s not explicitly referred to in the constitution , but you say that s the fundamental right and we have in the constitution language that says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed , and there s a question about that , that it s not a fundamental right so i think that s what makes people worry about our courts and our legal system today , and whether agendas are being promoted through the law rather than just strictly following what the law says judge sotomayor senator , may i sen sessions yes judge sotomayor address my use of the word fundamental \? fundamental is a legal term that i did n't make up it was the supreme court s term and it used it in the contextand uses it in the context of whether a particular constitutional provision binds the states or not and so i was n't using the wordithe panel was n't using the word in maloney in the sense of its ordinary meaning sen sessions oh , i know you were using the constitutional or the legal meaning but that s hugely important , because if it s not a fundamental right , it s not incorporated is n't that correct \? judge sotomayor well sen sessions and it will not apply to the states , fundamentally is n't that the bottom line \? judge sotomayor well , when the court looks at that issue , it will decide , is it incorporated or not \? and it will determine by applying the tests that it has subsequent to its old precedent whether or not it is fundamental and hence incorporated but the maloney decision was not addressing the merits of that question it was addressing what precedent said on that issue sen sessions all right well , we 'll review that on the question of foreign law , you yesterday said thatsaid this unless the statute requires or directs you to look at foreign law and some do some statutes do , by the wayyou go on and say , quote , the answer is no , foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent or to bind or influence the outcome of a legal decision interpreting the constitution or american law that s a pretty good statement , i think but this is what you said before in your speech to the american civil liberties unionactually , in april , just two or three months ago , in puerto rico you said this , quote international law and foreign law will be very important in the discussion of how we think about unsettled issues in our own legal system it is my hope that judges everywhere will continue to do this because within the american legal system we 're commanded to interpret our law in the best way we can and that means looking to what otheranyone else has said to see if it has persuasive value so that s troubling now , you also said yesterday that you agreed with justice scalia and justice thomas on the point that one has to be very cautious , even in using foreign law with respect to things american law permits you to do i do n't think that s exactly correct , or a fair summary of the import of your speech this is what you said before the aclu group a month or two ago , quote and that misunderstandingabout using foreign lawis unfortunately endorsed by some of our supreme court justices both unfortunately endorsedboth justice scalia and justice thomas have written extensively criticizing the use of foreign and international law in supreme court decisions they have somewhat a valid point and you point that out but then you go on to say but i think i share more the ideas of justice ginsburg in her thinking in believing that unless american courts are more open to discussing the ideas raised in foreign cases and by international cases that we are going to lose influence in the world close quote so everybody knows there has been a fairly robust , roaring debate over this question and there are basically two sides , one led by justice ginsburg , and one led by justice scalia and thomas do n't you think a fair reading of this statement is that you came down on the side of justice ginsburg \? judge sotomayor no , sir sen sessions \( laughs \) judge sotomayor because these conversations were in the context , and discussions were in the context of my pointing out , just as she had , that foreign law ca n't be a holding it ca n't be precedent it ca n't be used in that way she was talking about , the way i was toand what i said in my speech at the beginning and the end ideas , what are you thinking about \? judges use law review articles they use statements by other courts the new york court of appeals in a recent case looked to foreign law to address an issue that it was considering , not in terms of a holding for the court , but a way of thinking about it that it would consider my point is that i was n't advocating that it should ever serve as precedent or ever serve as a holding i was talking about the dialogue of ideas and sen sessions well , i 'dyou know , iwe goi just think that you laid out the two positions , and you came down on one side and i think that s a fair summary of that speech , which other people others can read and can make up their own mind you were asked about the prldef , the legal defense fund of which you were a member and a member of the board for 12 years and in response to senator graham s question , you say you 'd never seen any briefs , and that the main focus of your work at the organization was fundraising is that accurate \? judge sotomayor when i was responding to the senator , i was talking about the board in general i belonged to many committees , and so i did other things besides fundraising but i was beginning to explain what the structure of the board was and what the primary responsibility of board members is but clearly board members serve other functions in an organization sen sessions i know you did serve on the litigation committee and boards are supposed to , i would think , and legally are required to superintend the activities of the organization that they 're a member of , and then you have committees of the board who do various things i'm looking at a june of '87 document reportminutes of the board , the litigation committee sonia sotomayor reported that the committee , in addition to reviewing and recommending a litigation program , had identified three initiatives in october of '87 i'm just looking at some of the documents we were givenlitigation report quote , chairman sotomayor summarized the activities of the committee over the last several months , which included the review of the litigation efforts of the past and present , and initial exploration of potential areas of emphasis member sotomayor advised that a preliminary report would be provided at january meeting and then at the january meeting there s about a 50page document summarizing 30 or more cases that the board had undertaken a number of them are pretty significant and very consistent with the kind of case that we had in the firefighters case , where the board had filed litigation to really basically insist that you have perfect harmony between the applicants for a job and those who are selected for promotions is n't that true that you were more active than you may have suggested to senator graham yesterday \? judge sotomayor no , because as i saidi started to describe the role of the board generally , and we were not addressing the question of what i did or how i participated that memo has to be examined in context the memo was a moment in our 12year history where the board was planning a retreat to think about what directions , if any , we should consider moving into or not we were not reviewing the individual cases to see if the individual caseswhat positions were taken , the type of strategies sen sessions but did n't you know the cases that youthe positions the organization was sen leahy \( inaudible \) sen sessions well , my time was running out sen leahy your time has run out i was wondering if you 'd like to sen sessions \( laughs \) sen leahy finish answering the question sen sessions i 'll let you answer , but i'm just a little judge sotomayor the end of my answer was , the fund had been involved in a series of areasemployment , public health , education and others , and so the broader question for the fund was , should we be considering some other areas of interest to the community \? we held a retreat in which speakers from a variety of different civil rights organizations , academics , number of people came and just talked to us i do n't actually remember there being a firm decision that followed that , but it was a part of a conversation , the sort of retreats that even my court has engaged inwhat are we doing , what are we thinking about \? but it was n't a review of each individual case to judge its merits sen leahy judge , there s been a lot of talk about the maloney case i should note it s not what you said it was what justice scalia s opinion for the supreme court said and his decision left in place the 123yearold supreme court precedent on guns , did it not \? judge sotomayor justice scalia , in a footnote in the heller decision , noted the court s holding that the second amendment was n't incorporated against the states sen leahy the only reason i mention iti 've been a gun owner since i was probably 13 years old i 've seen nothing done by the supreme court , by the 2nd circuit court of appeals , by the congress or by our state legislature that s going to change one way or another the ownership that i have of the guns i now have senator kohl sen herb kohl \( dwi \) thank you very much , senator leahy judge sotomayor , you 've told us that you will follow the law and follow precedent , and you 've made a very big point of this , and that s all well and good but some of the court s most important landmark hearingslandmark rulings overruled longstanding precedent , like brown versus board of education , which ended legal segregation now , as an appellate judge , as we know , you 're required to always follow precedent but as a supreme court justice , you will have the freedom to depart from precedent so tell us how you will decide when it is appropriate to alter , amend or even overrule precedent judge sotomayor the doctrine of stare decisis is a doctrine that looks to the value in the stability , consistency , predictability of precedent and it starts from the principles that precedent are important values to the society because it helps those goals it also guides judges in recognizing that those who have come before them the judges who have looked at these issues had applied careful thought to the question and viewed things in a certain way , and a \( court \? \) shoulda judge should exercise some humility and caution in disregarding the thoughts and conclusions of others who camewho came in that position before them but that s not to suggest that the doctrine says that precedents is immutable and , in fact , i believe theengland had an experiment with that question , and it was not horribly successful precedents are precedents they 're not immutable they have to change in certain circumstances and those circumstances generally , as have been described by justice souter in the casey case , are probably the best articulation people have come to in sort of talking about the factors that courts think about and it starts with , well , how much reliance has the society put into the precedent \? what are the costs of changing it \? i should n't say start he put them in a different order there s no real importance to the order , because all are factors that you put into the weighing as a judge looks at a \( n \) existing precedent it looks to whether thewhatever the court has said is it providing enough guidance to the courts below and toand for people to determine what they can or ca n't do is the precedent administratively workable \? number threeand as i said , there s no ordering to thisare the facts that the court assumed in its older precedents , have those changed so that it would raise a question about the court revisiting a precedent \? also , hasare thethere are developments in related fields to precedents and approaches that are developed in those cases that may bring into question the foundation of an older precedent brown versus board of education has often been described as a radical change by some , and the public perceives it as a radical change when you actually look at its history , you realize that there had been jurisprudence for over 20 years by the court , striking down certaincertain schemes that provided separate but equal but in fact did n't achieve their stated goal and so there was underpinnings in brown versus board of education thatin those precedents that came before brown that obviously gave the court some cause , some reason to rethink this issue of separate but equal they also had before them theprobably one of the most famous dissents in american history , which was the dissent by justice harlan in plessy and justice harlan so carefully laid out what the constitution said , what the principles of the constitution were that motivated thethe congress to pass those amendments he laid out the court s precedents in that area and he said separate but equal is just not consistent with the constitution now , this is in an opinion where he described another group of people as different and so it was n't that he was being motivated by his personal views he was being motivated by a view of the law that the court in brown made a change about one final factor the court obviously looks at is the number of times a precedent has been reaffirmed by the court but all of these things are decided on the basis of judgment of a particular case and the arguments that are raised before a judge , and recognizing as a judge that precedent is deserving of deference , precedentand changing it should be done cautiously by a court , but precedent ca n't stand if other things counsel that it not sen kohl good judge , i 'd like to return to the topic of antitrust two years ago , in the twombly case , justice souter wrote an opinion that sharply department from precedent when it held that a plaintiff must show extensive evidence to support an antitrust case before the opportunity for any discovery otherwise , the case will be dismissed this decision makes it very difficult for any plaintiff to bring an antitrust action , particularly a consumer or small business without the resources to develop extensive economic evidence what is your assessment of this decision \? do you share the concern of many that this does serious damage to enforcement of antitrust law \? judge sotomayor as with all issues of statutory construction , my charge as a judge would be how do i apply a court s holding in a particular case to the next situation before me \? the concern that you express is one that i have heard about that case expressed by some but as a judge , i do n't make policy i do n't make the policy choices for congress i'm charged with looking at a particular situation that comes before me , looking at the court s precedent and applying it to that situation with respect to that case , ithat case , as i understand the case , had to do with how much had to be pled i did n't understand it to mean that there had to be the presentation of evidence at the pleading stage , just what had to be pled to withstand a motion to dismiss in the case sen kohl well , my understanding of his decision is that in the future , the plaintiffs must show extensive evidence to support an antitrust case before the opportunity for any discovery , or else the case will be dismissed now assuming that s correctand i'm not telling i'm positive , but assuming that s correct , does that cause you concern \? judge sotomayor as i said , the issue of concern is not how i look at the court s precedent , because what i'm doing in looking at the court s precedent is thinking about how it applies to another case the question of how to do that and whether that s right by the court would be a question that congress , who has passed the antitrust laws , would have to , in the first instance , think about changing sen kohl so then are you saying in a case that would follow , you would n't necessarily be bound by justice souter s decision in twombly \? judge sotomayor the court considers its various precedents in the context of a new situation in the cases decided by the courts , they 're applied to the facts of a particular case twombly is considered , as are all the court s precedents , in a new case that examines the issue of what a complaint must allege or not a allege sen kohl so you would not be bound by the twombly precedent is that what you 're saying \? judge sotomayor no , it s precedent sen kohl so you would be bound judge sotomayor it must be applied , as is all the court s existing precedents that have not been rejected by the court has to be considered it has to be weighed in the situation presented sen kohl all right i think maybe we can talk about that subsequently to understand what you mean and what i'm sayingmy reading of twombly versus your reading of twombly , as it will affect future antitrust cases my understanding is that it will have a very negative effect onnegative impact on the average person or small business s ability to bring an antitrust case that might otherwise have merit , because of the requirement that they present enormous amounts of evidence even before they can go to discovery , or the case is dismissed now if i'm speaking accurately , then i think that s a precedent that needs to be thought about very carefully , and that s why i asked the question judge sotomayor and senator , the one thing i do know as a judge is that every argument gets made to the courts not on one occasion but many \( chuckles \) the question that will arise is , what s the extent of the court s application in the next case \? sen kohl all right finally , judge , the supreme court not only has the power , as you know , to decide cases and to construe the constitution , but it also has the sole and absolute power to decide which cases it hears if you are confirmed , only you and three other judgesjustices can decide whether a case will be heard to begin with by the supreme court in recent times , the supreme court has received appeals in nearly 7 , 000 cases each year , and it only hears about 70 or 80 cases , as you know in other words , the justices choose to hear only about 1 percent of the appeals that they receive this is obviously a very , very crucial power that justices have now , i recognize that one of the criteria for choosing cases is to resolve disagreement among the circuit courts about a particular aspect of the law but many of the most important and prominent cases in the history of the supreme court did not involve splits in the circuit courts , but were instead cases of national importance so how will you determine which cases are so important as to warrant review by the supreme court \? in other words , which 1 percent of those appeals will you consider \? judge sotomayor what i knowand you did accurately describe one aspect of the supreme court s local rules that suggest that justices will consider a variety of factors in whether to grant cert or not , and one of those listed factors is disagreement among the circuitsdisagreements among the circuits , and circuits and state courts , and issues that have not been adequately addressed but require being addressed for a variety of different reasons it is very difficult to talk in the abstract about when cert should be granted , because each situation presents a different set of facts and each question about whether a case is in the right posture to look at an issueas i said yesterday , sometimes there yesterdayimay have explained earlier in a response to senator specter , and i know that you had stepped away , there are procedural there are cases that present other arguments than the one that the circuit split exists on and those other arguments might dispose of the case in the way the circuit court did and not necessitate the reaching of an issue there s a question , at least as some justices have defined it , of whether there s been enough percolation among the circuit courts so that all of the views of a particular issue have been fully explored the circumstances and the issues that each justice uses depends on the facts and the posture of what comes before it i would obviously consider the court s local rules i would give consideration to the point that some have raised that the court is not doing enough but that ca n't counsel taking cases that could only belook at mylook at the workload and see , can the casecan the court do this if it meets all the other criteria that goes into the mixture of whether to grant cert or not \? you do n't , like congress , think about policy we 're going to decide 150 cases this year you look at the cases that come before you , and you figure out which ones are in a place to be reviewed sen kohl thank you sen leahy thank you very much and senator hatch , we 'll turn to you , and then we willand then we will take a break after you 're finished sen orrin hatch \( rut \) well , thank you , mr chairman and i certainly appreciate your graciousness and patience that you 've had throughout these proceedings and i almost feel guilty asking you any questions , but there are some things i 'd like to clarify and also ask about , and that i think may be somewhat helpful to you as welli guess , depending on how you answer them but let me just say this , to clear up that matter of theyou know , the 7th circuit , like yours , said , you know , with regard to the whole issue on the validity of the incorporation doctrineand the footnote of justice scalia has been brought up here time and time again , but let me just say that here s what that footnote says it says with respect to cruikshanknow , cruikshank was a 19thcentury casei think it was 1868 that used the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment to justify incorporation here s what hishere s what his footnote says with respect to cruikshank s continuing validity on incorporation , a question not presented by this casethis is in the heller case in other words , the guncontrol casewe note that cruikshank also said that the first amendment did not apply against the states and did not engage in the sort of 14th amendment inquiry required by our later cases now , that washe was very clear on that , that since early in the 20th century , the 14th amendment due process clause is how you bring about incorporation and all that thethe 7th circuit case did was adopt the privileges and immunities now , i'm sure judge posner or easterbrookwhoever wrote the opinionknew that , but basically applied that and he was only using the privileges and immunities clause , and not the 14th amendment due process clause , which has been the way we 've applied incorporation for well overi think pretty close to a century now and that s the issue that s going to get to the supreme court and the 9th circuit got it right so you can see why people who want to keep and bear arms consider this a very , very important issue , and how do you do gethow do you get to the doctrine of incorporation and i was trying to make that clear when we had our prior questions to you but let me go into judicial philosophy just a little bit more , because it s a broader issue of what might be called your judicial philosophy or your understanding of the power and role of judges in our system of government in your opening statement on monday , you described your judicial philosophy with the phrase , quote , fidelity to the law , unquote now , i appreciate that , and that phrase is useful as shorthand , but i think it does need some more development you had some things to say about this the last time you were before this committee that was the confirmation hearing for your current position in the us court of appeals for example , you were asked whether you would read additional rights into the constitution you responded that you cannot do that because it is contrary to what you are as a judge you said that the constitution , quote , is what it is , unquote , and that constitutional rights have already been created for us , and that we cannot read more rights into it do you still believe that today , after all this experience you 've had on the circuit court \? judge sotomayor the sen hatch in other words , just to be clear , are you saying that judges cannot read new rights into the constitution \? judge sotomayor the constitution creates the rights it s immutable the right \( s \) that the constitutions \( sic \) have created ca n't be added onto , neither by congress orexcept by amendment , or by a court the question , as i viewed it at the time i was asked that question , was whether the court could now write a new right into the constitution that s a different inquiry than whether a court , in applying that right to a particular claimed interest under that right , would protect that interest sen hatch sure judge sotomayor and so that is one of the misnomers about the right to privacy and when i say misnomer , it can be misleading , because it s not that thei 've not viewed what the court has been doing as creating a right that does n't exist in the words of the constitution what i understand the court to be saying is , okay there s this situation someone s privacy is being affected by this government regulation does the right in the constitution , the liberty clause of the dueprocess provision , protect the individual from that invasion of their privacy \? people in shorthand have called this a right to privacy but in my view , what the court is doing is saying states , police officers , with the unreasonable search and seizuresyou ca n't do this act you can do this act in searching and seizure sen hatch sure judge sotomayor they 're not creating a new right of privacy they 're just saying how does this right that exists in this provision and the constitution has these wordswhat does it mean in this factual setting \? sen hatch well , as you know , when theywhen they did the griswold case , there wasthere was no language right to privacy in the constitution but they determined that therethat through penumbras and other approaches that they could find that at another point in the hearing you said , quote , i do n't believe we should bend the constitution under any circumstances it says what it says unquote now , you know , ii thinkif you could , maybe you can describe some ways that the court can bend the constitution judge sotomayor i said you ca n't the words are the words a court ca n't be looking to ignore the words or to change them what it does is apply those words to each situation i stand by that answer today as i did then sen hatch well judge sotomayor the constitution has rights sen hatch agreed judge sotomayor they aresome of them arei'm sorry , senator sen hatch i think what i'm saying , in light of the statement that i just asked you about , that we cannot read rights into the constitution , as you have said , would you agree that the supreme court bends the constitution when it does read rights into the constitution \? judge sotomayor what i understand the court to being doing in those situations in which it has recognized the protection of certain privacy interests and other interests is that it supplied those broad words to the facts of the situation before them and has determined that that right , as it s contained and expressed in the constitution , does apply to a certain set of facts sen hatch can the court changed the meaning of the words of the constitution \? judge sotomayor courts ca n't change the meaning of the constitution they can apply those words to the facts before them to see if the facts fall within the protections of the constitutional right at issue sen hatch okay in marbury versus madison the supreme court said that the constitution is intended to govern courts as well as legislatures do you agree with that , that it governs both courts and legislaturesthe constitution \? judge sotomayor the constitution limits the powers of all three branches sen hatch okay can the constitution control judges if judges can change its meaning \? judge sotomayor as one of the senators has pointed out , it is often said that the supreme court is not fallible it s infallible because it s final , so in terms of the interpretation of the constitution , that is the function of the court that is its function of checking or considering the acts of government visavis an individual or a state the constitutionit is that s established by marburyis interpreted by the court sen hatch okay one of my fellow judiciary committee members was speaking recently on the senate floor , and he said that judges may perceive , as he put it , quote , the need for change , unquote , and may make such change to their decisions is that an appropriate role for judges \? judge sotomayor as i 've indicated , the role of judges is to interpret both the constitution and law their role is to do both in accordance with their terms and so that is the function of a judge clearly , a judge looks at the terms and tries to , if it s notif it s the constitution , what are the principles that underlie that provision of the constitution and it s informed by precedent if it s a statute , you use principles of statutory construction , starting always with the words , and you give effect to congress s intent that s the role of a judge sen hatch okay in a speech you gave in march 2006 at the university of puerto rico school of law , you said , quote , i have often said that the basic difference between district court and circuit court judges is that district court judges do justice for the parties , while circuit court judges do justice for the society as a whole , unquote i think it s important that we get what you mean by this , especially the way in which appeals court judges do justice for society and this is even more important in light of your comments at duke law school that , quote , the court of appeals is where policy is made , unquote now , you have , i think , tried to distinguish that and in this increasingly broad trajectory of judicial power from the district court to the appeals court , from the parties to society , what do supreme court justices do justice for \? judge sotomayor in that speech as well as the duke law school remarks , they 're all in the context of trying to describe to students or lawyers what the focus of the district court is and the circuit court and all of them are talking about precedent when i was talking about justice for society , i was talking about we 're not looking at what the individual outcome is for the parties before the court the way that a district court is , because a district court knows that its decision is not binding on anybody else that there s not an invitation for them to follow whim or fancy , but their focus is on this case , what does it mean it s not affecting anybody else i'm just going to decide this case and in that speech , as with the duke remark , looked at in the entirety of the comment , it is , you 're doing justice for society when you 're establishing precedent , because you realize that that precedent is going to bind the cases so you 're looking at the effect of those cases on other , similar situations you 're lookingand i 've described it this way to other studentsyou 're looking at what the law is to announce it , recognizing that it s going to now affect other cases and other people sen hatch okay judge sotomayor so your focus is different district court s looking at the two parties the circuit court s looking at the law and a holding about the law that will affect many people sen hatch okay president george hw bush appointed you to the us district court in 1992 i was here about a year earlier , he nominated clarence thomas to the united states supreme courtwho , like you , was a us circuit court judge president bush described him as , quote , delightful and warm , intelligent person who has great empathy , unquote president bush then said that judge thomas would decide cases fairly , quote , as the facts and the law require in other words , he drew a clear distinction between the human quality of empathy and the judicial quality or dutyexcuse meof impartiality now this is obviously very different fromthan saying that a judge s personal empathy is an essential ingredient for deciding cases now which of these is closer to your own view distinguishing human empathy from judicial impartiality , or mixing them together so that empathy becomes part of the judicial decisionmaking process \? judge sotomayor two presidents have used the word empathy sen hatch right that s why i \( brought \? \) it up \( chuckles \) judge sotomayor and each of them has given it their different meaning and i ca n't speak for their choice of the word or make a choice between what meaning is closer to what i believe or not , because i can state what i believe very simply life experiences help the process of listening and understanding an argument the law always directs the result in the case a judge cannot decide cases on the basis of personal feelings , biases or sympathy to the extent i 've ever spoken about those things , it was to make sure that one understood and said that a judge always has to guard against those things affecting the outcome of a case the question of when it s appropriatethe supreme court has said some emotion s appropriate judges , if they 're reacting to an argument of a party , that s an appropriate emotion inappropriate is deciding the consequence based on that there arein sentencings you 're asked to look at the effect of a defendant s conduct on victims are you ruling on the basis of sympathy \? no but you 're being asked on the basis of life experience to understand that and then you look at that consequence and weigh all the factors that the statute commands you consider and then you come out at a reasonable \( word inaudible \) sen hatch i accept that you gave a particular speech at least five times , as has been mentioned here , over a period of nearly 10 years , both while you were a district court judge and an appeals court judge and you spoke specifically about some elements of judicial philosophy i know that senators discussed some statements from that speech with you yesterday , or from those speeches i just want to ask you about a few others , statements that you made when you gave this speech on the various occasions the first is your response to the thesis that judges must transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices so that their decisions are based on law , and , as a result , have more fairness and integrity do you agree that transcending personal sympathies and prejudices enhances the fairness and integrity of judicial decisions \? judge sotomayor yes sen hatch that s good i'm going to go through these as fast as i can with you , because i think it s essential in your speech , you consistently characterize the idea that judges transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices as an aspiration you question whether judges can achieve it even in most cases do you believe that transcending personal sympathies and prejudices is a judicial duty or an aspiration \? judge sotomayor when i was speaking about aspiration , i was talking about the fact that we do have personal experiences that may on occasion not permit us to understand an argument and so it s an aspiration in the sense of recognizing that we have those experiences i was n't talking about that it wasimpartiality was impossible i was just talking about the obligation sen hatch sure judge sotomayor of judges to monitor themselves from those unconscious influences that have affected their decisionmaking sen hatch sure in that same speech you stated , quote , the aspiration to impartiality is just that it s an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others , unquote now , i realize that jduges are people , they 're not robots or machines but here again you say that impartiality is only an aspiration now , i think you 've pretty well tried to explain the answer to the question , is judicial impartiality a duty or an aspiration i think you come down on the fact that it s a duty judge sotomayor it s absolutely a duty , senator and that s why i was speaking about the task judges have to ensure that unconscious influences do not affect their decisionmaking and we have to work hard at that but we do succeed at doing it but i was talking about the academic question but in the end it is always a duty to impartially decide the case before you sen hatch well , in that same speech you said that judges , quote , must not deny the differences resulting from experience and gender , but attempt to judge when those opinions , sympathies and prejudices are appropriate , unquote now , do you believe that a judge s personal opinions , sympathies or prejudices are ever appropriate factors in how he or she , or she or he , decide cases \? judge sotomayor in some situations , the court does sayin sentencing , in particularthat some measure of sympathy is important some measure of understanding the extent of someone s injury in a tort case , and what a jury might or might not award for that injury those are appropriate uses ofof sympathy in some situations , but it s not that the judge is deciding that as the result in the case it is that the law is giving the judge a variety of factors to consider and weigh , and tells the judge take onetake each one of these factors think about them weigh them , and come up with an end result that the law wants you to reach under a standard the law is setting that is what this speech was in the context of it was talking about that kind of effect of life experiences sen hatch thank you , judge my time is up sen leahy we 'll take a 15minute recess \( recess \) sen leahy \( gavels \) welcome back , judge we will skip over one , go to senator feingold you are recognized for up to 20 minutes i keep adding the up to , hoping that somebody will follow my example but you sen russell d feingold \( dwi \) well , i sen leahy but i do mean nobody will be cut off before 20 minutes sen feingold thank you , mr chairman i understand and i 'd like to begin using my time by asking that a letter from former members of prldef board describing the role of board members , which does not include choosing or controlling litigationi 'd ask unanimous consent sen leahy without objection , it 'll be part of the record sen feingold thank you , mr chairman judge , again , of course , thanks for your tremendous patience i 'd like to start by talking for a moment about the recent supreme court decision in caperton versus massey i consider this a significant case that bears upon the flood of specialinterest money that threatens to undermine public confidence in our justice system the facts of this case are notorious john grisham used them as an inspiration for his novel the appeal a jury in west virginia returned a 50million verdict for a large coal company , and pending the appeal , the company s ceo spent 3 million to elect an attorney named brent benjamin to the state supreme court that was a huge amount of money , relatively speaking more than the amount spent by all of benjamin s other financial supporters combined benjamin won the election , became a west virginia supreme court justice , and lo and behold , he voted to overturn that 50million verdict against his main campaign contributor twice he refused to recuse himself in the case , despite his obvious conflict of interest and last month the supreme court held that benjamin s failure to recuse himself was intolerable under our constitution s guarantee of due process of law the court also noted approvingly that most states have adopted codes of judicial conduct that prevent this kind of conflict and to that end , i commend the wisconsin supreme court s plan to revise its recusal rules to provide additional safeguards that protect judicial impartiality you 've been a judge for many years , and you may have seen examples when you thought a judge should have withdrawn , although hopefully none were as egregious as this case in your opinion , what additional steps should judges and legislators take to ensure that the judiciary is held to the highest ethical standards and that litigants can be confident that their cases will be handled impartially \? judge sotomayor senator , i would find it inappropriate to make suggestions to congress about what standards it should hold judges to or litigants to that s a policy choice that congress will consider i note that the american bar association has a code of conduct that applies to litigants the judicial code has a code of conduct for judges and as you noted , in the state system where judges are elected , many states are doing what i just spoke about , making passing regulations caperton was a case that was taken under the local rules of the supreme court , presumably that exercises supervisory powers over the functioning of the courts , and it presented , obviously , a significant issue , because the court took it and decided the case at issue fundamentally is that judges , lawyers , all professionals must on their own abide by the highest standards of conduct and i have given a speech on this topic to students at yale at one point , where i said the law is only the minimum one must do personally , one must act in a way in cases to ensure that you 're acting consistent with your sense of meeting the highest standards of the profession sen feingold thank you , judge as i'm sure you know , on the last day of the term , the supreme court ordered that a pending case involving federal election law called citizens united versus fec be reargued in september it s of course quite possible that you will be a member of the court by then i do not intend to ask you how you would rule in that case , but i do want to express my very deep concern about where the supreme court may be heading and then pose a general question to you in 2003 , the court in a 54 ruling upheld the mccainfeingold bill against a constitutional challenge i believe that ruling accurately applied the court s previous precedents and recognized that congress must have the power to regulate campaign finance to address serious problems of corruption and the appearance of corruption since the arrival on the court of its two newest members , the court seems to have started in another direction on these issues , striking down or significantly narrowing two provisions of the law the millionaire s amendment in the davis case , and the issue ad provision in wisconsin right to life several justices have even argued that corporations and living persons should have the same constitutional rights to support their chosen candidates , and that austin versus michigan chamber of commerce , a case rejecting that idea , should be overruled austin is premised on what i believe is an absolutely reasonable conclusion that the political activities of corporations may be subjected to greater regulation because of the legal advantages given to them by the states that allow them to amass great wealth in scheduling reargument in the citizens united case , the court specifically asked the parties to address whether austin should be overruled if the court does thatand depending on how exactly it rulesjudge , it may usher in an era of unlimited corporate spending on elections that the nation has not seen since the 19th century without addressing the specifics of the citizens united case , i 'd like to ask you what the constitution and the supreme court s precedents generally provide about the rights of corporations , and what the current state of the laws , as far as corporate participation and elections , is , as you understand it judge sotomayor senator , i have attempted to answer every question that s been posed to me you have noted that citizens united is on the court s docket for septemberi think it s september 9th if i were confirmed for the courtto the court , it would be the first case that i would participate in given that existence of that case , the very first one , i think it would be inappropriate for me to do anything to speak about that area of the law , because it would suggest that i'm going into that process with some prejudgment about what precedent says , and what it does n't say , and how to apply it in the open question the court is considering i appreciate what you have said to me , but this is a special circumstance , given the pendency of that particular case sen feingold and frankly , judge , i probably would say the same thing , if i were in your shoes judge sotomayor \( laughs , laughter \) sen feingold given the facts as they are i appreciate the opportunity to express what i wanted to say about that and with that , mr chairman , i'm going to use up less than half of my time sen leahy i thank you i think you have set a fantastic example ! \( laughter \) i commend you i say that in a totally nonpartisan fashion senator grassley sen charles grassley \( ria \) i assume that i get the time that he did n't use too \( laughter \) sen leahy no judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen leahy no sen grassley after you demonstratedwas it yesterday \? you demonstrated that you tend to turn people on , we do n't need any more \( laughter \) sen grassley okay judge sotomayor \( laughs \) sen leahy we do n't need any more excitement , senator grassley sen grassley yeah sen leahy we want it as lowkey as possible but you do have up to 20 minutes sen grassley yeah sen leahy the operative is up to 20 minutes sen grassley now i believe that i'm going to ask you something you never been asked before during this hearing , i hope i 'd like to be original on something i want to say to you that there s a supreme court decision called baker versus nelson , 1972 it says that the federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear due process and equal protection challenges to state marriage laws , quote , for want of substantial federal question , which obviously is an issue the courts deal with quite regularly i mean the issue of is it a federal question or not a federal question so do you agree that marriage is a question reserved for the states to decide , based on baker versus nelson \? judge sotomayor that also is a question sen grassley i thought i was asking a very easy judge sotomayor it s a question that s pending and impending in many courts as you know , the issue of marriage and what constitutes it is a subject of much public discussion , and there s a number of cases in state courts addressing the issue of whatwho regulates it , under what terms sen grassley can i please interrupt you \? i thought i was asking a very simple question , based upon a precedent that baker versus nelson is , based on the proposition yesterday in so many cases , whether it was griswold , whether it was roe v wade , whether it was chevron , whether it s a whole bunch of other cases that you made reference tothe casey case , the gonzales case , the leegin creative leather products case , the kelo caseyou made that case to meyou said these are precedents now are you saying to me that baker versus nelson is not a precedent \? judge sotomayor no , sir i just have n't reviewed baker in a while and so i actually do n't know what the status is if it is the court s precedent , as i 've indicated in all of my answers , i will apply that precedent to the facts of any new situation that implicates italways the first question for a judge sen grassley well , then tell me what sort of a process you might go through if a casea marriage case came to the supreme court , whether baker versus nelson is precedent or not \? because i assume if it is precedent , based on everything you told us yesterday , you 're going to follow it judge sotomayor the question on a marriage issue will betwo sides will come in one will say , baker applies another will say , this court s precedent applies to this factual situation , whatever the factual situation is before the court they 'll argue about what the meaning of that precedent is , how it applies to the regulation that s at issue , and then the court will look at whatever it is that the state has done , what law it has passed on this issue of marriage , and decide , okay , which precedent controls this outcome \? it s not that i'm attempting not to answer your question , senator grassley i'm trying to explain the process that would be used again , this question of how and what is constitutional or not or how a court will approach a case and what precedent to apply to it is going to depend on what s at issue before the court could the state do what it did \? sen grassley can i interrupt you again \? following what you said yesterday that certain things are precedent , i assume that you 've answered a lot of questions before this committee abouteven after you said that certain things are precedent , of things that are going to come before the court down the road if you 're on the supreme court you did n't seem to compromise or hedge on those things being precedent why are you hedging on this \? judge sotomayor i'm not on this because the holding of baker versus nelson is its holding as a holding , it would control any similar issue that came up it s been a while since i 've looked at that case , so i ca n't , as i could with some of the more recent precedent of the court or the more core holdings of the court on a variety of different issues , answer exactly what the holding was and what the situation that it applied to i would be happy , senator , as a followup to a written letter or to give me the opportunity to come back tomorrow and just address that issue i 'd have to look at baker again sen grassley i would appreciate it judge sotomayor it s been too long since i 've looked at it and so it may have been , sir , as far back as law school , which was sen grassley no , you were probably judge sotomayor 30 years sen grassley probably in grade school you were at that time judge sotomayor yeah , it wasno , that i looked at it , sir \( laughs \) sen grassley okay i want to go on but i would like to have you do that , what you suggested you 'd answer me further after you 've studied it i have a question that kind of relates to the first question in 1996 , congress passed and president clinton signed into law the defense of marriage act , which defined marriage , for the purpose of federal law , as between one man and one woman it also prevents a state or territory from giving effect to another state that recognized samesex marriages both provisions have been challenged as unconstitutional and federal courts have upheld both cases one is the wilson case one is the bishops case a district courtyeah , district court do you agree with federal courts , which have held that the defense of marriage act does not violate the full faith and credit clause and is an appropriate exercise of congress s power to regulate conflicts between laws of different states \? judge sotomayor that s very similar to the \( austin \? \) situation , but the aba rules would not permit me to comment on the merits of a case that s pending or impending before the supreme court the supreme court has not addressed the constitutionality of that statute and to the extent that lower courts have addressed it and made holdings , it is an impending case that could come before the supreme court so i ca n't comment on the merits of that case sen grassley have you ever made any rulings on the full faith and credit clause \? judge sotomayor i may have but if your specific question is , have i done it with respect to a marriagerelated issue , no sen grassley on anything in the full faith and credit clause judge sotomayor i actually have no memory of doing so sen grassley that s okay no , you can stop there that s okay now , i'm going to go to a place where senator hatch left off , but i'm not going to repeat any of the questions that he asked but there s one that i want to ask , and i feel a little bit guilty of this my dad used to have a saying to us kids that we were harping on something he says , when are you going to quit beating a dead horse \? but i want to ask you anyway you also wrote , quote , i wonder whether achieving that goal is possible in all or even in most cases and i wonder whether , by ignoring our differences as women and men of color , we do a disservice both to the law and to society , end of quote so the concern i have about the statement is it s indicating that you believe judges should and must take into account gender , ethnic background or other personal preferences in their decisionmaking process is that what you meant \? and i want to follow it up so i do n't have to ask two questions how is being impartial a disservice to the law and society \? is n't justice supposed to be blind \? judge sotomayor no , i do not believe that judges should use their personal feelings , beliefs or value systems or make theirto influence their outcomes neither do i believe that they should consider the gender , race or ethnicity of any group that s before them i absolutely do not believe that with respect toyes , is the goal of justice to be impartial \? that is the central role of a judge the judge is the impartial decisionmaker between parties who come before them my speech was on something else , but i have no quarrel with the basic principles that you have asked me to recognize sen grassley okay judge sotomayor no quarrel sounds equivocal i do believe in those things absolutely and that s what i have proven i do as a judge sen grassley okay then the last one on this point of another remark you made you also stated that you , quote , further accept that our experiences as women and people of color affect our decisions , end of quote and then , further quote , that personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see , and that , further quote , there will be some differences in my judging differences in judging is in parentheses based on my gender and latina heritage do you believe that it is ever appropriate for judges to allow their own identity politics to influence their judging \? judge sotomayor no , sir , absolutely not sen grassley okay then i want to move on to another area this question comes from your 1992 senate questionnaire you wrote , in response to a question about judicial activism , that , quote , intrusions by a judge upon the functions of other branches of government should only be done as a last resort and limitedly is this still your position \? and let me follow up when would such an intrusion be justified \? for example , what is an example of last resort \? what is an example of limitedly \? judge sotomayor the answer is , judgesand the manner in which that question was responded to was to the extent that there has been a violation of the constitution in whatever manner a court identifies in a particular case , it has to try to remedy that situation in the most narrow way in order not to intrude on the functions of other branches or actors in the process the case that i was discussed in my history has been the doe case , in which i joined a panel decision where the district court had invalidated a statutenotfound unconstitutional a statute that the legislature had passed on national security letters our panel reviewed that situation and attempted to discern and did discern congress s intent to be that , despite isolated provisions that might have to be narrowly construed to survive constitutional review , it held that the other provisions of the act were constitutional so the vast majority , contrary to what the district court did and i'm not suggesting it was intending to violate what i'm describing but the court took a different view than the circuit did we upheld the statute in large measure to the extent that we thought there were and found that there were two provisions that were unconstitutional , we narrowly construed them in order to assist in affecting congress s intent that s what i talked about limitedly in that answer so the vast majority , contrary to what the district court didand i'm not suggesting it was intending to violate what i'm describing , but the court took a different view than the circuit did we upheld the statute in large measure to the extent that we thought there were and found that there were two provisions that were unconstitutional , we narrowly construed them in order to assist in effecting congress s intent that s what i talked about limitedly in that answer sen grassley okay a little bit along the same line , in your law review articles you wrote that , quote , our society would be straitjacketed were not the courts , with the able assistance of the lawyers , constantly overhauling and i do n't know whether that s your emphasis or mine , but i 've got it underlined overhauling the law and adapt maybe i better start over again quote our society would be straitjacketed were it notwere not the courts , with the able assistance of the lawyers , constantly overhauling the law and adapting it to the realities of everchanging social , industrial and political changes explanation of the statement from you i think you 're saying that judges can twist the law regardless of what the legislature , the elected branch of government , has enacted into law , is kind of my interpretation of that obviously , i think you 're going to tell me you do n't mean that , but at least you know where i'm coming from judge sotomayor no , that interpretation was clearly not my intent and i do n't actually remember those particular words , but i do remember the speech i assuming you 're talking about returning majesty to the law and there i was talking about a broader set of questions , which was how to bring the public s respect back to the function of judges and i was talking about that judgesthat lawyers have an obligation to explain to the public the reasons why what seems unpredictable in the law has reason and i mentioned in that speech that one of the big reasons is that congress makes new laws that was the very first reason i discussed and also that there s new technology , there s new developments in society , and what lawyers do is come in and talk to you about , okay , we 've got these laws , how do you apply them to this new situation \? and what judges doand that s why i was talking about the assistance of judgesisof lawyersis what you do is you look at the court s precedents , you look at what a statute says , and you try to understand the principles that are at issue and apply them to what the society is doing and that was the focus of my speech , which was , talk to the public about the process do n't feed into their cynicism that judges are activists , that jduges are making law work at explaining to the public what the process is i also talk to , in part of my speeches , what jduges can do to help improve respect of the public in the legal process sen grassley so the use of the word overhaul does not in any overhaul the law does not in any way imply usurpation of legislative power by the courts \? judge sotomayor no and if you look at what i was talking about , it was thesociety develops sen grassley \( yeah \? \) judge sotomayor we are not today what we were a hundred years ago , in terms of technology , medicine , so many different areas there are new situations that arise and new facts that courts look at you apply the law to those situations but that is the process of judging , which is sort of trying to figure out , what does the law say about a set of facts that may not have been imagined at the time of the founding of the constitution \? but it s what the judge is facing then how do you apply it today \? sen grassley yeah i want to go back to didden , based upon my opportunity to reflect on some things you said yesterday the time limit to file a case in didden was three years mr didden was approached for what he classified as extortion in november 2003 two months later , in january 2004 , he filed his lawsuit but under your ruling mr didden was required to file his lawsuit in july 2002 , close to a year and a half before he was actually extorted so that does n't make sense to require someone to file a lawsuit on a perceived chance that an order might occur he also testified that the supreme court s kelo decision was not relevant to the didden holding but your opinion , in cursory fashion , which is a problem that we 've addressed yesterday , states that if there was no statuteoflimitation issue , kelo would have permitted mr didden s property to be taken it s hard to believe that an individual s property can be seized when he refuses to be extorted without any constitutional violation taking place it s even harder to believe that under these circumstances mr didden did not deserve his day in court or at least some additional legal analysis could you please explain how mr didden could have filed his lawsuit july 2002 before he was extorted november 2003 \? and also , please explain why a july 2002 filing would not have been dismissed because there was no proof that mr didden had suffered an injury , only an allegation that he might be injured in the future judge sotomayor the basis of mr didden s lawsuit was the state ca n't take my property and give it to a private developer and because that is not consistent with the takings clause of the constitution to the extent he knew the stateand there s no dispute about thisthat the state had found a public use for his property , that it had a public purpose , that it had an agreement with a private developer to let that developer take the property , he knew that he was injured , because his basic argument was state ca n't do this , it ca n't take my property and give it to a private developer the supreme court in kelo addressed that question and said , under certain circumstances the state can do that if it s for a public use and a public purpose and so his lawsuit , essentially addressing that question , came five years after he knew what the state was doing the issue of extortion was a question of whether the private developer in settling a lawsuit with them was engaging in extortion and extortion is an unlawful of asking for money with no basis but the private developer had a basis he had an agreement with the state and so that is a different issue than the timeliness of mr didden s complaint sen leahy thank you senator cardinwe 'll recognize senator cardin and then for those who have to plan we 'll then recess until 9 30 tomorrow morning sen ben cardin \( dmd \) well , judge , let me first say since this will be my last time in this hearing to address you , to say this has been my first confirmation hearing for a supreme court justice and you have set a very high standard for me for those i might have to consider , because there s always a possibility of future vacancies on the supreme court , as to responding to our questions , being very open with us and i think really demonstrating the type of respect for the process that has really shown dignity to you and to our committee and i thank you for that i thanked you in the beginning for your willingness to serve the public as a prosecutor and as a judge and now willing to take on this really incredible responsibility and i just really want to emphasize that again i do n't know if you thought when you were being considered for this what you would have to go through as far as the appearance before the judiciary committee but it gets better after our hearings , i believe let me ask you one or two questions , if i might i want to follow up on senator kohl s question on the selection of cases under certiorari as has been pointed out , there s maybe 1 percent of the cases that are petitioned for the supreme court actually will get an opinion from the supreme court and will be decided now , senator kohl asked you what standards you would use and i just really want to concentrate on the impact that a supreme court can have i'm going to refer to one of your cases , the boykin case , which was a housing case where a borrower , you allowed that borrower to go forward , african american , on a discrimination issue and we 've seen throughout history discrimination against minorities in housing , with redlining and predatory lendingled to the fair housing act , enacted by congress the supreme court has long recognized titles 7 and 8 of the federal housing act , part of the coordinated scheme of the federal civil rights laws enacted to end discrimination but there s still major challenges that are out there predatory lending still takes place it s happened during this housing crisis with the subprime mortgage market , targeted towards minority communities i say that and , in relationship to the boykin case , which i agreed with your conclusions that not only could affect the litigants that were before you but could have an impact on industry practice if in fact there was discrimination and a case was decided by your court and the same thing is true in the supreme court , more so in the supreme court it is the highest judgment of our land and yes , you have to be mindful when you take a case on cert as to the impact it will have on the litigants certainly , you have to take into consideration if there s been different inconsistent rulings in the different circuits but it seems to me that one of the standards i would hope you would use is the importance of deciding this case for the impact it has on a broader group of people in our nation , whether it s a housing case that could affect communities' ability to get fair access to mortgages for homeownership or whether it s a case that could have an impact on a class of people , on environmental or economic issues and i just would like to get from you whether this in fact is a reasonable request , that as you consider certiorari requests that one of the factors that is considered is the impact is has on the community at large judge sotomayor as i indicated earlier , we do n't make policy choices that means that i would think it inappropriate for a judge to choose a case based on some sense of i want this result on society a judge takes a case to decide a legal issue , understanding its importance to an area of law and to arguments that parties are making about why it s important the question of impact is different than what a judge looks at , which is what s the state of the law in this question and how and what clarity is needed and other factors but as i said , there s a subtle but important difference in separating out and making choices based on policy and how you would like an issue to come out than a question that a judge looks at in terms of assessing the time at which a legal argument should be addressed sen cardin and i respect that difference , and i do n't want you to be taking a case to try to make policy but i do think the need for clarity for the community as to what is appropriate conduct , wellbeyond the litigants of a particular case , is a factor where clarification is needed , should weigh heavily on whether the court takes that type of case or not judge sotomayor there is just no one factor that controls the choice where you say , i'm going to look at every case this way as i said , judgeswell , i should n't talk because i'm not there \( laughs \) sen cardin all right judge sotomayor but my understanding of the process is that it s not based on those policy implications of an outcome it s based on a different question than that sen cardin well , let me conclude on one other case that you ruled on , where i also agree with your decision , and that s the ford versus mcginnis where you wrote a unanimous panel opinion overturning a district court summary judgment finding in favor of the muslim inmate who was denied by prison officials access to his religious meals , marking the end of ramadan you held that the inmate s fundamental rights were violated , that the opinions of the department of corrections religious authorities cannot trump the plaintiff s sincere and religious beliefs the freedom of religion is one of the basic principles in our constitution as i said in my opening comments , it was one of the reasons why my grandparents came to america freedom of religious expression is truly a fundamental american right please share with us your philosophy as tomaybe that s the wrong use of termsbut the importance of that provision in the constitution and how you would go about dealing with cases that could affect that fundamental right in our constitution judge sotomayor i do n't mean to be funny , but the court has held that it s fundamental in the sense of incorporation against the states \( laughs \) but it is a very important and central part of our democratic society that we do give freedom of religion , of practice of religion , that the constitution restricts the state from establishing a religion and that we have freedom of expression in speech as well those freedoms are central to our constitution the ford case , as others that i have rendered in this area , recognize the importance of that in terms of one s consideration of actions that are being taken to restrict it in a particular circumstance speaking further is difficult to do , again because of the role of a judge to say it s important , that s it s fundamental , that it s legal in common meaning , is always looked at it in the context of a particular case what s the state doing \? in the ford case that you just mentioned , the question there before the court was did the district court err in considering whether or not the religious belief that this prisoner had was consistent with the established traditional interpretation of a meal at issue , okay \? and what i was doing was applying a very important supreme court precedent that said it s the subjective belief of the individual is it really motivated by a religious belief \? it s one of the reasons we recognize conscientious objectors , because we 're asking a court not to look at whether this is orthodox or not , but to look at the sincerity of the individual s religious belief and then look at what the state is doing in light of that so that was what the issue was in ford sen cardin well , thank you for that answer again thank you very much for the manner in which you have responded to our questions thank you , mr chairman sen leahy thank you very much , senator cardin as i noted earlier , we will now recess until 9 30 tomorrow morning , and wish you all a pleasant evening thank you end

democrats pushing for health care reform got serious jolts last week from critics who warned that their proposed legislation would do little to slow spiraling health care costs a group of conservative democrats vowed that they would join republicans to block action in a crucial house committee unless more cost restraint was imposed and douglas elmendorf , the respected head of the congressional budget office , warned that none of the bills he has seen impose fundamental changes in how medical care is delivered and paid for health care reform is vitally important both to cover tens of millions of uninsured americans a moral imperative and to bring down the relentlessly rising costs of care those costs are straining not only the government s budgets for medicare and medicaid american businesses are struggling to provide insurance for their employees millions of americans are struggling to pay high medical bills and rising premiums many are just a pink slip away from being uninsured mr elmendorf s testimony should prod democratic leaders to come up with more and better ways to restrain costs for federal programs and the health care system as a whole the white house was certainly paying attention it called for the creation of an independent expert body to propose fair payment rates and other costsaving reforms for medicare that is a sound idea that could lessen the influence of highpressure lobbying by drug companies , insurers , hospitals and doctors that inevitably drives up costs the pending bills do an excellent job of providing health insurance for millions of uninsured americans at a cost of roughly 1 trillion over the next decade mostly for subsidies to low and middleincome people and expansion of the medicaid program for the poor president obama has rightly insisted and congressional leaders have agreed that this expansion of coverage must not drive up the deficit over the next 10 years it has to be fully paid for by new taxes or big savings in medicare and other federal programs whatever legislation emerges from congress is expected to do so or face a veto the knottier problem is how to slow the rate of increase in health care costs those costs are growing faster than inflation , wages and the overall economy this is the issue that mr elmendorf was addressing , and he seemed to be thinking beyond the 10year budget window to the likely impact on future deficits he is right to be concerned if the government simply extends subsidized insurance to millions of uninsured people but fails to force fundamental changes in the delivery or financing of health care , then federal health care costs will keep escalating at excessive rates that will drive up deficits in subsequent decades unless new taxes are imposed or new savings found the budget office is concerned only with impacts on federal spending and the deficit but any changes to medicare s policies would reverberate through the whole health care system as health care providers changed their practices and private insurers followed medicare s lead the house bill makes a good start in the right direction by proposing changes in medicare reimbursement rates and various pilot programs to encourage greater productivity and less costly forms of care but more could and should be done medicare ought to be empowered , for example , to reduce its payment rates to the highestcost hospitals and most inefficient doctors that is probably the best way to get them to stop providing needless tests and treatments that do n't improve the health of the patient medicare should also be allowed to use the results of comparative effectiveness research to set reimbursement policies favoring the best treatments unfortunately , as currently written , the house bill calls for that research but prohibits medicare from using it to set rates all of these ideas seem well worth trying the longrun solution is to move away from medicare s feeforservice system that rewards doctors and hospitals for each additional service they provide and move into a new system where doctors and hospitals are organized and rewarded in ways that encourage both lowcost and highquality care the problem is that nobody is sure of the best way to do that the house bill is right to set up pilot programs to test some approaches but more ideas should be developed and tested much to the anger of leading democrats , mr elmendorf also suggested that congress might consider taxing employerprovided health benefits he seemed to mean the most generous policies that many economists think encourage excessive use of medical care that could raise several hundred billion dollars to pay for the expansion of coverage and , unlike the taxes on wealthy americans proposed in the house bill , is likely to keep pace with future increases in health care costs a tax on employerprovided benefits would probably also encourage workers to choose lowercost policies and use health care more sparingly but it is politically risky and it could turn many americans away from supporting health care reform it might best be considered as a last resort
atlanta the replica of george w bush s desk still sits in the oval office beneath the iranian and american flags the seal of the president of the united states still adorns the floor mats across the hall from the zebraskin rug and the porch overlooking the 75car parking lot is still called the truman balcony but soon enough , change is coming to fred milani s replica of the white house , an outsized casualty of the national housing crisis for the last seven years , almost as long as president bush has been in washington , mr milani , an iranianamerican home developer , has lived in a scaleddown version of the presidential mansion in atlanta a private xanadu for mr milani , a headache for neighbors and a destination for camerawielding gawkers , the 16 , 500squarefoot home has become a kooky symbol of this boomboom city s evergrowing residential skyline but now , like the current occupant of the real white house , mr milani is planning to leave his home i still do not want to sell , he said but i will last month , mr milani , 57 , placed his house , in the north druid hills neighborhood , a few miles northeast of downtown , on sale for 988 million a prominent builder of mcmansions in a city that once could barely consume enough of them , mr milani has fallen on financial hard times as the demand for real estate has waned twice he has narrowly avoided foreclosure on his home although he recently sold five houses , he is losing money on five other unsold ones and must repay multiple loans the notion of someone selling a replica of the presidential mansion possibly to a buyer in dubai is both humorous and painful to atlantans , who are enduring one of the country s highest foreclosure rates , which they attribute , in part , to policies that come from the real white house the forced sale of one of the city s most expensive homes , owned by someone who made his fortune in homebuilding , makes clear the widespread nature of the real estate collapse the housing crisis has affected people at all income levels , said mary norwood , a member of the atlanta city council this has been devastating to the whole economy over the last 20 years , small ranchstyle houses in north druid hills have given way to multimilliondollar mansions , many built by mr milani but none as unorthodox as his white house neighbors have long been split in their reactions to the milani house honestly , we are very happy to be living next door to the white house , said keith klugman , a global health expert at emory university there are certain quirkinesses , but he is a very good neighbor but another neighbor , gary moss , a retired film professor , has had reservations certainly anybody has a right to build whatever is legal , mr moss said but my concern is that people are building houses that are so much larger than their families need they seem like monuments to affluence rather than monuments to what people need inside its wroughtiron gates , the atlanta white house is a singular pastiche of middle eastern d cor \( wall rugs , a hookah \) , american political kitsch \( abraham lincoln and the emancipation proclamation painted onto a bedroom wall \) , religious iconography \( a tapestry of the last supper , a giant crucifix \) and selfpromotion \( an m tiled into the pool , a bust of mr milani \) it falls to shawn ghiai , the real estate agent for the atlanta white house , to answer the question of who would want to move into such a personalized home \? wealthy international buyers , most likely , mr ghiai said or maybe i 'll contact one of the contenders for the real white house , maybe john mccain or ross perot mr milani works in his own oval office guests sleep in the lincoln bedroom and all 43 presidents plus presidentelect barack obama stare down from a poster on his kitchen wall all from a man who follows politics only loosely really , i am not very political , mr milani said the architect just asked , how about i build you the white house \? ' and i said yes that is the whole story he voted for president bush twice , he said , but after the economy deteriorated , he became a big fan of mr obama most of his support , however , is reserved for god he converted to christianity from islam in 1995 , and his house reflects his adoration of his adopted faith in the front hedges , he spelled god you in topiary a lifesize carving of a biblical scene overlooks the congregation room in his basement , where leaders of his church baptize muslims into christianity but the atlanta white house s signature piece of artwork is a ceiling mural of jesus ministering to people of various races a hispanic man wears a sombrero , an american indian dons a headdress , and at the feet of jesus is mr milani himself , his head bowed in submission it s a very unusual house , so it may be difficult to sell , mr ghiai said it s hard to sell homes , period , because of this economy but there are still people with money , and if they find a good deal like this one , they will jump on it several potential buyers have toured the property , and another person in dubai is hoping to visit soon , mr ghiai said despite the challenges , mr milani and his wife , yvonne , believe that god will assist them in selling the house jesus has always helped me , he said , even in the last minute when asked where he will live next , mr milani said he did not know but he proposed , halfseriously , i may build the congress building across the street
madeleine peyroux bare bones \( rounder \) on each of her previous three solo albums madeleine peyroux kept the focus on her voice a small , distinctive thing with all the weathered charm of a fleamarket antique her new album , bare bones , features her singing no less purposefully than the others , but it presents her as more of a songwriter than before each of its 11 tracks has her name in the credits , and together they add up to a declaration of selfhood as the title suggests , this is an album about core principles love and solitude , rumination and survival on songs like i must be saved and instead , ms peyroux urges a strict focus on matters of the heart , imploringly or insouciantly elsewhere , on the title track and river of tears , she tunes out the world to better savor her grief and she takes asceticism to rather uneasy extremes with homeless happiness , which idealizes a life without shelter or possessions \( no hurries , no worries for me , she coos really \? \) most of the songs were written with collaborators , notably the album s producer , larry klein , whose soft touch can also be felt throughout along with ms peyroux s vocals and acoustic guitar , there are vintage keyboards and parts for mandolin , violin and pedal steel it all feels tasteful , companionable and often saggingly dull perhaps a steelier singer could use this much gauze for ms peyroux , it s vaseline on the camera lens but a few songs cut through , none better than love and treachery , written with joe henry and mr klein here ms peyroux combines concrete imagery with weighty pronouncement , evoking the style of leonard cohen , whose songs she has often covered but in your voice i 'll hear my own and recognize the crime , she sings , softly but evenly that all your love and treachery has ended up as mine madeleine peyroux performs on tuesday at joe s pub joespuborg nate chinen photo
republicans are pronouncing obama s stimulus a failure today s announcement is an acknowledgement that the democrats trilliondollar stimulus is not working , and the american people know it , house minority leader john boehner said in a statement when they passed this spending plan , democrats said it would immediately create jobs , yet nearly four months later unemployment has continued to climb and none of their rosy predictions have come true just sayin'

more than 60 galleries and dealers from the united states and abroad significantly fewer than last year s 76 are installed in the 69th regiment armory for the 15th new york international tribal textile arts show missing from the floor are some of the highend european dealers in african art , and the english textile dealers , but there is still the usual bounty of lavish textiles , sculpture and statuary , exotic curios and jewelry an emphasis on extraordinary textiles from indigenous and precolonial cultures is a hallmark of this show it is true again this year , with outstanding central asian material at gail martin gallery a selection of colorful persian and syrian carpets and utilitarian bags at alberto levi and a pair of heavily beaded northwest coast indian leggings at myers and duncan it is all presented with deft professionalism and backed up with some useful educational material not too many dealers have shipped big , expensive stone sculpture , given the economy , but there are one or two monumental wooden pieces for a reminder of the role of religion in daily life in africa , stop by dave deroche to see a late19thcentury rhythm pounder , probably senufo , from ivory coast this imposing wooden sculpture of a woman was used to pound the earth each spring to enhance the soil s fertility and ensure a good harvest as always , there is a small but fine selection of pacific island material lewis warra has an unusually ornate , possibly mid19thcentury malagan ceremonial mask from new ireland , a part of new guinea , while the thomas murray display includes some top masks from the sepik river in papua new guinea , one shaped like a bird s beak they are part of a group of a dozen beautiful oceanic carvings from a single california collection put up for sale for pure fascination and enjoyment , visitors might like to check out the handpainted wooden egyptian sarcophagus lid , about 1069702 bc , at arte primitivo it is in great condition equally enchanting is a minor retrospective of paintings by selftaught artists at cavinmorris , including a delightfully simple painting of a mule by bill traylor , the alabamaborn former slave and outsider artist , that was drawn on a montgomery , ala , sidewalk in the 1940s there is lots of other strange and wonderful stuff in the show , though some of it is hiding in cases , so you really have to take the time to look clam galerie has a mayan poison bottle that is close to 1 , 400 years old , while kip mckesson has a carved divining staff used by a tanzanian witch doctor to make the rain come , ward off evil spirits , see the future or even frighten enemies on the eve of battle who would n't want to hold the staff \? another revelation is the range and beauty of native jewelry in gold , silver , tin , shell , stone and other materials what an obvious inclusion this material is , although there has not been so much of it at the fair in the last few years the jewelry has an undeniable beauty , so i would not be surprised if more finds its way into future shows let s hope so the peripatetic british videomaking conceptualist phil collins confuses humanitarian and artistic impulses his latest project was commissioned by the aspen art museum mr collins observed that many people working in the service sector of aspen , colo , the upscale town , are spanishspeaking immigrants from outlying , less privileged areas resolving to produce something that would appeal to that underserved constituency , he created soy mi madre , a sophisticated parody of a spanish television soap \( the exhibition also includes a slide show of mostly uninteresting snapshots by people who gave mr collins their film to develop and a set of nondescript framed photographs , some made from slides he found in an old carousel \) unlike his previous lowtech videos , this film has high production values he made it in mexico city with professional soap opera actors in spanish with english subtitles and melodramatic music , it is a 28minute episode , a tangled tale of love , intrigue , betrayal and murder involving two maids , a gardener and the wealthy couple they work for with each scene , there s a whole new set of actors , and at one point the camera reveals the production crew in the background , filming the action so , in a limited way , the film is a familiar , postmodern comment on the artificiality of filmmaking , though it has none of the mindboggling , worldswithinworlds complexity of , say , charlie kaufman s synecdoche , new york in its exaggerated play with soap opera clich s , mr collins s movie is not as funny or imaginative as it so visibly strains to be it is also hard to imagine it did much to democratize aspen his real viewership , english or spanishspeaking , is the contemporary art world s cognoscenti to pretend otherwise is disingenuous , selfserving and condescending more than 20 years ago , charles ray created a piece of kinetic sculpture that became famous even though hardly anyone saw it ink line \( 1987 \) , a fine stream of black ink flowing from a little hole in the ceiling to another in the floor now it is publicly exhibited for the first time ink line is a oneliner a joke about minimalism but it is remarkable nevertheless it looks like a length of shiny black rubber , but on closer examination , you can see that it is moving invisibly , below the floor , the ink is collected and pumped back up behind a wall and across the ceiling to the hole from which it reemerges two other pieces from the '80s are on display in moving wire \( 1988 \) , the ends of a length of wire snake in and out of fine holes drilled into the wall as one extends , the other retracts spinning spot \( 1987 \) is a 24inch circle cut out from the floor and spinning at 33 1 3 rpm perhaps it is the split between the illusion and the presumed reality underlying it that makes these deceptively simple sleights of mechanical engineering so compelling one part of the mind experiences them as magical another knows that hidden machinery is running them this is not an uncommon experience think of flying in an airplane or communicating by email we live in a world of supernatural effects , and we take it on faith that someone knowledgeable is in control carrie moyer s abstract paintings are getting stronger and , as the title of her third solo show at this gallery suggests , more mysterious combinations of opaque and translucent layers tease the eye , as do forms that recall the famous vaseprofile illusion in the front gallery a group of canvases explores stacked , tripartite figures that bring to mind a game of exquisite corpse the one in rebus has a harp for a torso and a pair of breasts where the head should be dada and surrealist associations become more explicit in ballet m canique , titled after the percussive 1924 performance conceived by the painter fernand l ger and the composer george antheil \( oddly , it looks more like the collages of hans arp than anything by l ger \) larger canvases in the back room approach abstraction from all angles and nationalities and from both sexes , associating freely with the artists in alfred stieglitz s circle , wpaera murals and midcentury color field painting feminist art of the 1970s is part of the mix , though less prominent here than in ms moyer s earlier works the arcane element has less to do with the origins of these forms than with how they are veiled and masked prismatic glazes , mixed with glitter and sometimes poured or swirled together , can be glimpsed through openings in a field of dark purplishbrown and red strings pass between the various levels of the painting , inviting kabbalistic study the anxiety of influence , to borrow harold bloom s phrase , runs through matt sheridan smith s show of second and thirdgeneration minimal and conceptual art in places , it s productive timeworn strategies of seriality and negation are revived by some of the existential humor of the office tv show in this category are drawings , made with scratchoff ink over lorem ipsum text \( latin copy used as a placeholder in graphic design \) , and a sculpture of stacked fiberboard sheets cut to international paper formats a1 through a4 mr smith sometimes winds up reinventing the wheel a set of white pedestals sized by applying the golden ratio to the artist s body measurements could be a robert morris or a piero manzoni , without the attitude there is a similarly generic feeling to a looped video , untitled \( open shut \) , that edits down robert bresson s film l'argent \( 1983 \) to seven minutes of doors opening and closing it exists , seemingly , in a bermuda triangle of authorship between the original film , the work of douglas gordon and anonymous youtube auteurs the best work voices frustration instead of dismissing it neon sculpture \( unbent \) , a halfemptied box of 48inch neon tubing , speaks to the ubiquity of this particular medium in contemporary art since dan flavin and bruce nauman it implies , counterintuitively , that the anythinggoes nature of artmaking today can be a kind of straitjacket not that younger is necessarily better , but jack youngerman , 83 , is living up to his name his new paintings have an exhilarating , youthfulseeming punch in bright , playskool colors and with a direct , slightly brushy touch , mr youngerman has been creating centered , hardedged compositions on star , diamond , threeleaf clover and ovalshaped plywood panels based on drawings he has been making since the 1970s , his designs feature celtic knots , russian constructivist motifs , abstracted floral patterns , radiating stripes and a generally poppsychedelic vividness it is the tension between compression and expansion that makes the paintings so gripping there is also a certain numinous vibe to them they are like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood as mandala compositions , they invite meditation on a holistic reconciliation of opposites , the containment of chaos by order yet , for all that , they remain just paintings sensuous , handmade artifacts of a culture pining for the miraculous

baghdad late july and early august is date harvesting season in , when within the span of a few weeks the desert sun turns hard green spheres into tender , golden brown fruit prized for its sweetness but here in iraq , one of the places where agriculture was developed more than 7 , 000 years ago , there are increasing doubts about whether it makes much sense to grow dates or much of anything for that matter as recently as the 1980s , iraq was selfsufficient in producing wheat , rice , fruits , vegetables , and sheep and poultry products its industrial sector exported textiles and leather goods , including purses and shoes , as well as steel and cement but wars , sanctions , poor management , international competition and disinvestment have left each industry a shadow of its former self slowly , iraq s economy has become based almost entirely on imports and a single commodity ninetyfive percent of the government s revenues come from oil , said ghazi alkenan , an iraqi economist and while they are trying to attract investment in the private sector , iraq finds itself in very difficult circumstances without sufficient electricity , machinery and a drought the has been particularly damaged during the past few years , a situation perhaps nowhere more apparent than in the country s once bountiful date orchards have been left to die for lack of water , and and pests have ruined thousands of tons of fruit because the country has only three cropdusting airplanes and three qualified pilots american military approval is still needed to fly even the wealthiest and most influential date farmers are struggling faraoun ahmed hussain , the 62yearold scion of a dategrowing family who serves as the head of the government agency that oversees iraq s date production , said his family s 62 acres in south baghdad have been producing at the lowest level in memory i could put more money into it , but the situation does not encourage it , he said under normal circumstances , the owner of such property would be a very wealthy man iraq , which once produced threequarters of the world s dates and grew 629 different varieties , is now an alsoran , falling behind egypt , iran and saudi arabia last year , the country produced 281 , 000 tons , according to the ministry of agriculture , about half the level of the mid1980s the number of iraq s date palms has fallen , too , to fewer than nine million from 33 million in the 1950s , according to the government likewise , the number of date processing factories is down to six today , from 150 before the americanled invasion in 2003 iraqi dates are now packaged in the united arab emirates 865 miles away iraqi and american officials say the declining fortunes in date production and other seasonal agricultural work have fed the insurgency with desperate , outofwork young men the decline , iraqi government officials say , has also led to both public health and environmental degradation as growers have abandoned farms , the orchards that had once formed a lush green ring around baghdad have shrunk , causing more frequent sandstorms in the capital this summer and higher rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses still , dates remain a staple in iraq , valued for their ability to stay fresh without refrigeration , as a source of nutrition , and for uses as varied as making alcohol and desserts and feeding farm animals they are also an inexpensive sugar substitute as the head of a partnership that includes his 12 brothers and 6 sisters , dr hussain is the master of a once prosperous , now unkempt orchard on the banks of the tigris river in the dora neighborhood on a blazing hot summer morning recently , he gave a tour the story of the orchard , which his family has owned since 1910 , has been one of slow decline because the amount of money he receives for his crop from the trade ministry the agency that buys most farm products in iraq is sometimes less than the cost of production , he says he no longer invests much in the farm each year , even the most productive trees provide less in normal times , each palm might produce 130 to 175 pounds of fruit a year last year , each tree produced just about 30 pounds this season , dr hussain is hoping to rebound to 90 pounds per tree many of the orchard s 4 , 000 palms , which can live 120 years , are clearly unhealthy a fair number have either brown fronds or a white fungus that resembles cobwebs half of the orchard is irrigated by well water , the other half by the tigris but because of a drought , now in its second year , farmers have been ordered to limit irrigation to twice a month instead of once or twice a week fruit trees orange , grapefruit and pomegranate planted beneath the palms , look to be nearly dying of thirst the ground is bone dry and dusty even some of the palms , which need very little water , are withering water salinity has also become a vexing problem dr hussain pointed to some of the healthier palms these trees are 40 years old , and i have some emotion , some love for them , because i planted them , he said i 've watched them grow even here , there are signs of iraq s war accompanying dr hussain are five bodyguards , at least one of whom is armed and stationed at the edge of dr hussain s orchard is a 50member kurdish pesh merga military unit they are protecting the home of jalal talabani , iraq s president , who is kurdish and lives across the river from the orchard dr hussain said that despite the instability brought by the war , iraq s date industry could recover if the trade ministry would increase payments to farmers and if iraq s date orchards can be restored to their former glory , he said , the rest of iraqi agriculture might be able to similarly rebound the trade ministry , however , has said that given continuing depressed international prices for oil iraq s lone dependable export it cannot afford to raise payments to farmers none of dr hussain s children want to have anything to do with the family s date orchard his son is a pharmacist , his eldest daughter an engineer the youngest daughter is a science student , but has no interest in agriculture dr hussain said the date farm would almost certainly die with him it will be sold , he said shrugging it will be painful for me to do that , but i accomplished my duty for my family and for my tradition there is nothing else to be done
margate city , nj was not at the game in white plains the night before , so he did not see his washington generals make another spirited comeback against the , only to fall short for something like the 10 , 000th time in a row klotz was here , at his beachside brick house of 47 years , the true home of the wayfaring washington generals , a team he founded in 1952 and named in honor of dwight eisenhower someone surely would have called if his team had won it s not a matter of winning and losing , klotz , 88 , said on wednesday good thing klotz stood in an upstairs room filled with the mementos of a globetrotter , if not a globetrotter there were posters and photographs of klotz with famous basketball players , politicians , even popes there were framed magazine and newspaper articles about him on the walls clippings filled notebooks on the shelves outside , the waves fell against the shore , one after another , each quickly forgotten and left uncounted , like so many generals losses klotz long ago came to grips with his basketball legacy that of the victim , the foil , the loser he is the founder , owner and longtime player \( until the late 1980s \) and coach \( until 1995 \) of a team that must have the worst record of any in history as the globetrotters prepared for a weekend of performances in and around new york , including two on friday at madison square garden \( the globetrotters and the generals simultaneously have a west coast tour going , too \) , klotz was just happy to see his generals in their familiar greenandyellow uniforms again when kurt schneider became chief executive of the globetrotters in 2007 , he immediately asked klotz to change the name of his team back to the washington generals , not the new york nationals , the new jersey reds , the boston shamrocks or any of the other monikers that klotz had created , at the globetrotters' behest , over the years i brought back the washington generals because , first of all , the globetrotters have to play the washington generals , schneider said on tuesday evening as the westchester county center in white plains filled with fans this is the team that has been playing against them since the early '50s and '60s and '70s they are almost as big in pop culture as the globetrotters are , albeit for different reasons one wins and one loses the globetrotters and the generals have a long and often misunderstood relationship they are separately owned and operated , bound together as opponents through a contract klotz s soninlaw , john ferrari , is the general manager of the generals , collecting unsung former college players willing to play the straight men for the globetrotters' timetested bag of tricks the teams do not travel together behind the arena on tuesday night , two buses idled one an intricately painted tour bus for the globetrotters , the other a standardissue charter bus for the generals and never , klotz said , has his team been asked to lose absolutely not , he said not with anybody none of these owners have told me to lose whatever obstacles they 're going to do , that s their business i 've been against the harlem globetrotters for 50some years , and i know nothing about their business i do n't ever bother about their business that s their business i have my own team klotz , a 5foot7 sharpshooting guard at south philadelphia high school and villanova , won an nba championship with the baltimore bullets in 1948 \( a fit and ebullient greatgrandfather , he still plays halfcourt pickup games several times a week , draining twohanded set shots , but he is temporarily sidelined because he threw out his shoulder throwing a baseball \) the first time he played the globetrotters , as a member of the american basketball league s in the 1940s , his team won i dribbled out the clock , like , klotz recalled he led teams over the globetrotters a couple more times , the owner of the globetrotters , eventually called he said , i want you to get a good team together to play us every night , ' klotz said i said i'm going to beat you' and he said , you 're going to try' it happened once , officially , and twice , in klotz s mind the controversial one was in 1962 , when the scorer s book said the generals had won but the scoreboard disagreed , and no one was in the mood to set things straight in 1971 , in martin , tenn , the generals playing as the new jersey reds won in overtime klotz made a shot , missed one the generals celebrated in the locker room by spraying soda on one another to fans , though , klotz said it was as if his team killed santa claus it s the worst thing in the world that can happen , to beat them , klotz said he walks a fuzzy line on one side is the desire to win , to earn an audience s respect , to allow his players a chance to exhibit their skills so that they may find other basketball jobs , maybe even with the globetrotters , which is not uncommon on the other is the recognition for why fans come to watch the globetrotters , not the generals the teams get nervous when asked about the legitimacy of their games the biggest trick has been to make the globetrotters look invincible while the competition appears formidable the generals know their place they play a utilitarian , undertherim style , all layups and jump shots they play mantoman defense , following their men through the renowned weave \( if they slip up and make a mistake , they 're going to lose the ball , klotz said \) and falling for the backdoor alleyoop every time when the globetrotters go into one of their many routines , where the rules of the game are suspended \( along with the clock , sometimes \) , the generals never upstage the stars night after night , they have their shorts pulled down or the ball stuck into the back of their jerseys , which do not have their names on them they patiently watch the confettiinthebucket trick and gamely play defense during the globetrotters' football sketch when the game ends , they slip from the court practically unnoticed antoine maddox is in his second season with the generals he played at lagrange college in georgia , and hoped to land a professional basketball job from december to april , he plays more games than he would anywhere else \( about 120 in 115 days \) , travels the world \( 100 cities \) , and is paid about what he would make in the continental basketball association or the nba s development league i love being part of this , maddox said but my hoop dreams do go beyond this hopefully , one day but right now this is just a blessing , and i love it the generals have become more of the shtick than ever , rebranded as the globetrotters' rival and painted as the rare unlovable underdog the crotchety coach taunted the fans , eliciting boos several routines involved him cheating , which would seem to contradict klotz s hope that the legacy of the generals is that of good sports one bit involved a bet between the coach and a globetrotters star , if the generals won , the globetrotter showman had to switch teams and become a dreaded washington general , the announcer explained the idea was to build suspense in a game where there really is none can we win again \? klotz said if they turn around instead of doing some of the routines , we 'd have a chance you know what i mean but those routines are what people want to see they 're giving the audience what they want to see his team has been good for the globetrotters , and the globetrotters have been awfully good to him there is no doubt which side of the wonlost column klotz sees himself on it turned out to be the greatest experience of my life , he said i would n't trade it for anything out the window , the waves pounded the shore , over and over , and over again
so here we are at the world s most famous arena amid what s been billed as one of the best big east tournaments in the league s 30year history so what is everyone talking about today \? none other than dennis wolff from press row to the assistant coaches scouting the games to the buffet line here at msg , everyone is baffled as to why boston university fired wolff , a universally respected veteran coach i appreciate you saying that , wolff said when hearing about the shock over his firing at the garden you would like to think over 15 years coaching and trying to do things the right way , you ve built up some respect in the bank you re forgiven if you don t know who dennis wolff is he had a 15year career at bu that included a 247197 record , five postseason berths and a 100 percent graduation rate he s a coach s coach , a gruff disciplinarian with a solid record of success i think it s sad , said villanova coach jay wright , who coached against wolff in the america east while at hofstra you re not getting anyone better perhaps the most stunning thing is that wolff had four years remaining on his contract , which means that the university will have to pay him more than a million dollars that s a large amount for a school that plays at the lowmajor level , especially in these economic times \( america east commissioner patrick nero refused to comment when reached by phone on thursday \) boston university overcame two key injuries to starters this season and finished third in its league at 115 they were 1713 over all , but the season ended in disappointment with an upset loss to umbc in the america east tournament i know dennis wolff , said wright , who acknowledged not knowing the specifics of the situation i know how good of a coach he is i know how great a representative of that university he is i know what a great program he runs it shocks me and it s clearly shocked the basketball world , as the surprising move had everyone abuzz after wolff said he was given vague reasons \( another direction , and coaching style \) for his dismissal , he told his bosses i have some respect in the basketball community , and this is not going to be looked at as a good thing
the confluence of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and veterans day \( armistice day in europe \) has prompted numerous observations in opinionland , though perhaps none have proved so contentious as robert d kaplan s short meditation on the fall of the wall , at the atlantic kaplan s post is a lament for the fact that though the united states won the cold war , it lost europe in the process european nations are no longer strong partners in us efforts toward liberating societies further eastward , writes kaplan postwall , what does the european union truly stand for besides a cradletograve social welfare system \? in europe , civil society is giving way to decadence the end of the cold war was not just a culmination of the long european war that began in 1914 , but also a new beginning that allowed us to direct our energies towards liberating societies further eastward it s a struggle we ve devoted ourselves to for a while now , and we re fairly far along with it the european union is now struggling to incorporate serbia , and we are trying to salvage something noble from iraq and seek peaceful regime change in iran but america is much too alone in taking on this work europe , having been liberated from nuclear terror at the conclusion of the cold war , proved unable to muster the gumption to deal with yugoslavia on its own , or , as the case of afghanistan shows , to demonstrate much enthusiasm for any great collective effort which leads to the question what does the european union truly stand for besides a cradletograve social welfare system \? for without something to struggle for , there can be no civil society only decadence thus , with their patriotism dissipated , european governments can no longer ask for sacrifices from their populations when it comes to questions of peace and war ironically , we may have gained victory in the cold war , but lost europe in the process the various writers responding to kaplan have reached for a wide range of comparisons for his argument at the american prospect , mori dinauer says that kaplan s post is a poor imitation of orsen welles cuckoo clock speech , in addition to being firstorder nonsense  but what s most stunning is his ignorance of recent european history does the senior fellow at the center for a new american security really not know that europeans eagerly threw themselves into the first world war , and in its devastating aftermath , have spent the decades since trying to make sure such a thing never happens again \?  well ! writes alex massie at the spectator it s almost as though kaplan thinks more wars are a good thing ! without them , after all , there is the terrifying prospect of lapsing into gosh ! decadence now besides a cradletograve social welfare system i d say that the eu stands for , or at least has ambitions towards , peace and prosperity and that , whatever one may think of the organisation , these are hardly small things indeed , their absence through for much of the twentieth century was , shall we say , marked for that matter , absorbing the countries of central and eastern europe into the eu is itself no tiny task and one that , not unreasonably , has preoccupied europe these past twenty years that this absorbtion has , generally speaking , been a success is also an achievement of note and , of course , the process is not yet complete \( there have , for sure , been some serious problems along the way hello yugoslavia \) but no , apparently a europe at peace is a symptom , or perhaps a proof , of weakness yet when considering the history of the twentieth century , a dissipation of patriotism in the sense kaplan employs the term , which is to say , a dissipation of the willingness to fight vast and costly wars unless they become a matter of utmost necessity might be considered no bad thing either it may be that a national effort on the scale of that mounted between 1939 and 1945 is no longer be possible but that s a thesis that , happily , has remained untested since , again mercifully , there s been no opportunity to try it on for size normally that too might be considered a good thing even if one grants the wars in iraq and afghanistan and more generally , the conflict with radical islam the status of war it s clear that the natures of these conflicts are rather different from previous wars national survival does not , despite what the fretters say , seem imperilled a degree of stout vigilance may be no , certainly is required but that s not quite the same thing kaplan s argument is actually rather similar to one made in the edwardian age then too we were told that civilisation had grown fat and soft and complacent then too , a fair number of intellectuals suggested that a purging moment of barbarism , while undoubtedly unfortunate for the victims , might be a useful means of reinvigorating our dangerously decadent societies well , we saw where that led us , didn t we \? at american conservative , daniel larison says that kaplan is doing his best otto von bismarck imitation  bismarck was once quoted as saying that the world would succumb to materialism without war kaplan replaces materialism with decadence , but the idea is much the same it is also worryingly similar to teddy roosevelt s concept of war as a kind of invigorating sport as massie notes , kaplan is rehashing ideas that were last fashionable approximately a century ago before wwi taught \( almost \) everyone that they were complete rubbish in fact , the main movements that came out of the horror of wwi convinced more than ever that constant struggle and endless wars of liberation were essential to political health were the communists and fascists larison takes issue with a number of kaplan s points , including his assertions that russia is again trying to split europe into east and west camps and that germany is , in kaplan s phrase , torn between east and west he also doesn t buy kaplan s line that iran presents a challenge equal to that of liberating eastern europe this is not true the challenge of the latter was larger and of greater strategic significance than anything related to iran losing iran as an ally in 1979 was a significant blow to the us position in the region communist collapse was vastly more valuable for advancing us interests in europe the two things are not all that comparable in significance kaplan writes , iran holds the key to changing the middle east why iran \? well , he will tell us iran has been a state in one form or another since antiquity , and has a far more urbanized and sophisticated population than most in the arab world where have we heard this before \? it used to be that iraq held the key , and a lot of people made a great deal of noise about iraq s central location in the region , and many stressed the importance of its sophisticated , welleducated , urbanized , more secularized population it used to be the case that agitators for war with iraq believed that changing iraq could change the region precisely because it was majority arab and not persian as iran was now it is iran s persianness that makes it the more suitable for regional transformation because of the cultural advantages this is supposed to offer the new story is no more true than the old one kaplan holds up a fantasy as a likely future with a reformist regime in power in teheran , turmoil in iraq will lessen and hezbollah may eventually be robbed of a sturdy patron , even as syria is forced to make its peace with the west , and hopefully with israel , too file these predictions under things that are never going happen reformists are no less interested in projecting iranian power in iraq and lebanon , and why would they be \? mousavi was partly responsible for the foundation of hizbullah does anyone really believe that he would now turn against them \? what will happen in iran to force syria to do either of these things \? if syria breaks with iran , it will be in spite of iranian political change and not because of it at firedoglake , spencer ackerman asks kaplan on what planet did the us endeavor for 50 years to contain the soviet union and commit itself to european security so that european soldiers would one day become our cannon fodder \? i d really love to read the history books you read ackerman also argues that kaplan misreads the work of building the european union in reality , europe is about to conclude a massive , historic treaty that , writes matthew yglesias , clears the last major obstacle to a substantial overhaul of european union institutions , and paves the way for substantially more continental unity by any conceivable definition , that is a great collective effort but since it entrenches peace throughout the european continent , somehow it falls into the decadent category for kaplan it really was preferable to have european nations constantly at war with each other ! that s what great nations do similarly , last month , the european defense ministers pledged themselves to gen mcchrystal s counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan having visited eu embassies over the past few weeks , i can report that there are expectations of greater nato troops , as well will they be as numerous as us troops \? of course not that s a function of a \) us defense spending being so massively massively superior to european defense spending , b \) nato publics generally being less sympathetic to the war , and c \) a global economic recession all that context makes european commitments to afghanistan appear more impressive , not less at think progress , matt yglesias writes that kaplan is merely highlighting the fundamental difference between neoconservative thinking and thinking undertaken by people with a moral compass as alex massie says , presentday europe s state of peace , prosperity , and physical security is a good thing neoconservatives , however , see war and death as good things irving kristol told corey robin that marketoriented conservatism is too boring \( the notion of devoting your life to it is horrifying if only because it s so repetitious it s like sex \) so you need to inject some death and destruction into the mix to keep things interesting the world would be a better place if people looking for cheap thrills would stick to the black metal scene or maybe take up extreme sports rather than foreign policy punditry but the point is that it s extremely dangerous to take advice from people with this mindset they re not even trying to enhance the country s security , they re trying to embroil the country in wars
at the coex convention center in this city s southern district , a site best known for sleek business exhibitions , kang dalsoo , 76 , joined the rush to check out the silver job fair offering 2 , 000 private sector and 4 , 700 public sector jobs for retirees it seems i need to learn text messaging in order to deliver flowers , mr kang said anxiously after an interview at a courier company s booth he wanted to work even though flower delivery was not his ideal job but he was worried about having to master a new technology and wondered if he would be able to keep the job even if he got it silver job fairs , established to find jobs for people 60 and older , have mushroomed across south korea in the past year as part of a government effort to assist a rapidly growing population of older koreans adrift in a changing society until recently , the notion of older people having to look for jobs did not cross the minds of most south koreans the traditions of confucianism hold that adult children should take primary responsibility for the care of their aging parents , who would enjoy respect and high status as sovereigns of the household but this practice is crumbling under the weight of longer life spans and changes in family structure , and many koreans are entering the later stages of their lives unprepared a government survey released in july found that fewer than 27 percent of koreans 60 and older had made any provision for their postretirement years beyond investing in their children s education now , many of these older koreans are dismayed to find themselves dependent on their children , often in cramped urban settings , with very different priorities these days , if adult children are willing to take in elderly parents , they often make it clear that they expect those parents to do household chores and look after the grandchildren , prospects that can make the parents think twice about moving in according to the national statistics office , 483 percent of south koreans 65 and older were living with their children in 2007 , compared with 724 percent in 1990 the government is scrambling now to fill the gap in support , and older job seekers are responding this year employers have received an average of three applications for every job offered at the fairs , compared with 15 applications in previous years a government pension system , financed in part by employee contributions , was introduced in 1988 for retirees over 60 but only 28 percent of the working population is covered many koreans of that age , particularly those who worked as farmers , never held jobs that qualified for such pensions for those who did , many are not receiving the monthly allowance , which averages less than 193 , because they chose to take their pension in a lump sum at retirement in 2004 , the government ordered the national pension service to try to find jobs for older workers by 2006 , the project was made permanent , overseen by a new independent body called the korea labor force development institute for the aged job placements rose from about 30 , 000 in 2004 to more than 83 , 000 in 2006 and 196 , 000 in the first half of this year despite that progress , there still are not enough openings for older job seekers so local governments have been creating publicly financed silver jobs , like chaperons for children returning home from latenight cram schools , gas station attendants , opinion survey interviewers and wedding officiators then they urged potential private employers to set up booths at silver job fairs the government offers subsidies to private companies that hire older people and pays half the roughly 163 in monthly wages for each person employed by the public sector at the seoul silver jobs fair , desperation was in the air as 30 , 000 or so people crowded the booths exploring openings for work most had never expected they would need han teresa , a job placement counselor who had helped organize the fair , described a man in his early 70s who had flopped down on a chair in front of her he said , 'i thought i 'd die a few years after i retired , ' ms han said 'i never believed i 'd be alive for another 10 years or so lee eunseok , 77 , who had applied for a job as a garbage sorter , said , i hope my daughterinlaw asks us to live with them soon her eldest son and his wife had been citing the lack of a spare bedroom for the delay , she said but mrs lee s husband , han chulsoo , 78 , said he feared that none of their four sons would ever invite them to move in and so he joined his wife at the fair doing what was once the unthinkable looking for a job nam suhyun , 30 , had come to the job fair to submit r \?

when the greatest savior in franchise history crumbled to close a dismal homestand thursday , the hit another low in their rocky season they have lost five consecutive games for the first time under manager joe girardi , and s arm strength is lacking rivera allowed for the first time in his career , losing by 86 to the at yankee stadium carl crawford and evan longoria connected with one out in the ninth inning as the completed a twogame sweep there is hope for the yankees in baltimore on friday , when alex rodriguez plays his first game after recovering from hip surgery rodriguez is not known for grace under pressure , but that is what he needs with the yankees staggering none of us are asking him to be a savior , girardi said all we 're asking is to just be alex one guy cannot change your club something must change for the yankees , who have not held a lead since the fifth inning last saturday the yankees are 6 for 43 with runners in scoring position during their losing streak , and mark teixeira was 0 for 5 and booed repeatedly thursday that is what happens to a 198 hitter making 225 million no wonder , then , that teixeira is eager for rodriguez to join the team and hit cleanup behind him i'm going to give him a big hug when i see him tomorrow , teixeira said rodriguez will not be the only newcomer in the camden yards clubhouse the yankees need yet another catcher after jose molina , the backup to the injured jorge posada , strained his left quadriceps running the bases in the fourth inning molina left yankee stadium to have a magnetic resonance imaging exam , and girardi said he would probably be placed on the disabled list even if he is not , the yankees will need another catcher besides francisco cervelli , who was hitting 190 for class aa trenton before his promotion yet the night s worst sight was clearly a beaten rivera , who has allowed four home runs this season as many as he gave up all of last season , and more than his total in eight other years girardi said rivera s shoulder was tired last week , explaining his diminished velocity if i try to pinpoint something that is not right , well , the only thing i would say is speed , said rivera , who had surgery to remove a calcification from his shoulder last september my velocity is not quite there yet but i'm feeling good the longer i go in and pitch , it will get there i do n't worry about that crawford battled rivera for three fouls after a 12 count , and then smacked a fullcount pitch to right for his first home run of the season longoria s blast was his second of the game starter andy pettitte allowed four homers for the first time in his career , but he did not seem too bothered by it pettitte , who is known for flogging himself in postgame interviews , seemed powerless to counter the elements the bottom line is , the way the ball was jumping tonight , if you left anything up and they got the barrel on it , it was going to be a home run , pettitte said jason bartlett , who hit one homer last season , started the game with a poke into the rightfield seats on an 02 pitch carlos pena , who won wednesday s game with a 10thinning blast off phil coke , followed with a moon shot for his 13th of the season the yankees came back to tie after trailing by 40 and 64 , but they never pulled ahead that has been a recurring theme lately , but even the presence of the game s highestpaid player friday will not change everything more of us need to hit , johnny damon said another guy coming in who has a chance to hit does n't necessarily do it we need to have it go from top to bottom and keep putting pressure on the other team the only pressure now is on the yankees , who have mounting problems that go beyond the reach of rodriguez inside pitch starter chienming wang threw 72 pitches in extended spring training thursday , allowing no runs and three hits in five innings according to joe girardi , wang was throwing 91 miles an hour with good action on his sinker he is scheduled to throw 100 pitches tuesday , possibly for one of the yankees' minor league affiliates , and could be activated from the disabled list after that wang was 03 with a 3450 earned run average in three starts , but he needed more time to recover from a foot injury that had caused weakness in his hips

sherman lewis opened the offense up a bit against the eagles jason campbell now sometimes throws past the sticks on third down but with chris cooley injured , personnel is a much bigger issue than playcalling the falcons defense is bigplay vulnerable , allowing 12 plays of 20 or more yards in the past two games , but big plays are a onceaweek phenomenon in washington instead of giving snyder a copy of the game plan this week , lewis just drew a picture of a box and assured the owner that the game plan was inside texans \( 53 \) at colts \( 70 \) sunday , 1 pm line colts by 9 the texans have scored one more point than the colts , and they have gained 167 more yards , putting them ahead of the colts on the offensive leader boards the trouble is , the texans have also played one more game the colts offense is still better in nearly every relevant category , from yards per play \( 65 to 57 \) to third down efficiency \( 511 percent to 371 percent \) , and the colts offense is getting healthier \( donald brown might play this week anthony gonzalez returns soon \) while the texans offense is getting hurt tight end owen daniels \( out for the year \) was the texans secondbest receiver , and his loss causes a ripple effect the backup tight end joel dreessen is also the texans only healthy long snapper , so the texans are one injury from turning every punt and field goal

seahawks by 10 the lions , like the real estate market , are improving so slowly that it takes detailed analysis to measure their advances last year they allowed 88 yards per pass attempt this year it

is like cheering a 005 percent gain in housing values while upsidedown on a halfmillion dollar townhouse mortgage , but lions fans and realtors know that bottoming out is more a process than an event

by 9 1 2 the rookie quarterback josh freeman played college football for a bad kansas state team with no running game , few receiving weapons and a porous offensive line in other words , he s ready to play for the buccaneers receiver antonio bryant said rookie quarterbacks face a major adjustment from college to the pros they re used to being in college and throwing to wide open receivers or semiopen receivers , he said and here , being open is the difference of a step or two to clarify , in tampa being open usually means the defender fell down the packers are experts at bullying the

2004 meltdown are as topical as howard dean jokes belichick will shift defenders all over the line of scrimmage before the snap to prevent manning and center jeff saturday from customizing the pass protection , but kitchensink strategies now only have limited impact on manning he completed 75 percent of his passes and threw two touchdowns in beating the patriots last year , and belichick lacks the time and manpower to invent yet another mousetrap injuries , however , can do to the colts 17game winning streak what defensive schemes cannot colts defensive backs bob sanders , kelvin hayden and marlin jackson are out , leaving the rookies jerraud powers and jacob lacey as the first line of defense against randy moss and wes welker powers and lacey have been playing well , but they are

steelers \( 62 \) sunday , 1 pm line steelers by 7 sweeping the ravens was well and good , but validation for the bengals comes from beating the steelers in pittsburgh the bengals ushered in their brief period of relevance in 2005 with a 3831 victory in week 13 at heinz field the steelers avenged that loss a month later with a playoff win , and it took the bengals three years to recover that s a sign of just how quickly the afc north hierarchy is reestablished bad news for the bengals , because the steelers win on monday night over the upstart broncos shows they re in hierarchyreestablishing mode the injury report favors the steelers defensive end antwan odom is out , and linebacker keith rivers is doubtful that leaves the bengals without two of their three most important defenders cornerback johnathan joseph can shut down santonio holmes , but he can t provide pass rush or stop the steelers running game the loss of chris henry depletes a receiving corps already missing two tight ends , so the bengals passing creativity will be limited the bengals were at full strength when they beat the steelers in week 3 , and the steelers dominated that game for three quarters before some late lapses there is good news for the bengals even with a loss , they will most likely finish the year with a 51 division record \( they are 40 now \) , which will give them important playoff tiebreaker advantages jaguars \( 44 \) at jets \( 44 \) sunday , 1 pm line jets by 7 rex ryan spent two days in florida during the bye week he wasn t scouting the jaguars he was

it turns out , is swagger everyone has a swagger on this team , tight end visanthe shiancoe said during the bye week it s just a different swagger everybody expects to win , offensive tackle bryant mckinnie clarified several sources indicate that favre brought said swagger from green bay , perhaps illicitly and with accomplices everybody on that team stole our swagger , the packers great santana dotson said of the vikings the greek word for swagger is hubris , and rampant swagger talk often presages a losing streak , which in this case could be blamed on favre s swaggersquelching groin injury

the sounds of the velvet underground echoed in the virgin megastore in union square on sunday afternoon , as bargainhunting passersby and hardcore music shoppers poked through what few items remained at the last largescale record store in new york city it was the final day of business for the virgin megastore chain in north america , which at its peak had 23 locations but by sunday was down to two the 57 , 000squarefoot , twolevel new york outlet , and a smaller hollywood shop that was also set to close in union square posters trumpeted 90 percent discounts and offered the sale of all furniture and equipment but when the store opened , perhaps 90 percent of the merchandise had already been sold , leaving two tables of cds and dvds , a dozen tshirt racks and a few other scattered displays with the music industry stuck in a decadelong crisis , the sight of a record store closing is hardly surprising but for many shoppers at union square on sunday the loss of a big outlet in one of the most heavily trafficked areas of the city was particularly dispiriting unfortunately the large retail music store is a dinosaur , said tony beliech , 39 , a former virgin employee who was lugging around an armful of cds that he said would cost him no more than 20 it does matter because it was also a social gathering space , and that s one thing that buying music online lacks dozens of smaller record stores are still open in new york , and at least 2 , 000 independent shops exist around the country , according to the almighty institute of music retail , a market research company many of those independents have banded together to promote events like record store day , which had its second anniversary in april they are also promoting vinyl saturday on june 20 , which will feature specially produced records by artists like wilco and modest mouse to draw customers but the record store ranks have been severely thinned in recent years , and new york , once home to at least three largescale music chains , now has none last month virgin shut down its other new york megastore , in times square \( there are still virgin megastores in europe and the middle east , but under different ownership \) hmv like virgin , of british origin pulled out of the american market in 2004 tower records closed its 89 american stores in 2006 trans world entertainment , which operates the fye chain , has closed at least 280 of its locations over the last two years , leaving it with about 700 , but none comparable in size to the virgin megastore it s clear that the model of the large entertainment specialist working in a large space is not going to work in the future , said simon wright , the chief executive of virgin entertainment group , north america to an extent the closings are a result of the overall drop in music sales from the industry s peak in 2000 when some 785 million albums were sold until the end of 2008 , album sales fell 45 percent , according to nielsen soundscan even with the rise of itunes and other online outlets , however , cds have remained consumers' format of choice , though that advantage is slipping as recently as 2006 , cds accounted for more than 90 percent of album sales last year that proportion dropped to 84 percent , and so far in 2009 it is 77 percent as many as twothirds of all album sales are made at large chains like fye , walmart and best buy , according to industry estimates the titanic that is physical media started slowly sinking in 2000 , said michael mcguire , an analyst with gartner , a market research firm , when asked about virgin certainly this is a traumatic event for those who worked there , but it s an expected product of the digital transition but the end of virgin is also a product of business concerns unrelated to music its first american store was opened in 1992 in los angeles , and it set itself apart from rivals by developing a clublike atmosphere with booming sound systems and by offering steep discounts the indies learned from them and applied that to our stores , said michael kurtz , president of the music monitor network , a coalition of about 100 independent retailers as cd sales declined , the megastores remained profitable by offering tshirts , dvds and other items the times square outlet , for example , had annual sales in excess of 50 million , according to company reports , making it by many industry estimations the highestvolume record store in the united states in 2007 virgin s north american branch was bought by two real estate firms , related companies and vornado realty trust , and in a reuters interview last year an executive from vornado made it clear that the chain s true value was not in its sales but in the real estate that its stores occupied in both times square and union square , analysts say , virgin s rent was a fraction of the going rate forever 21 , a fashion chain , is taking over the times square store a spokeswoman for related companies said it was in negotiations for the union square site but declined to identify any potential new tenants at union square on sunday most new and popular titles had long since been gobbled up in relative abundance , however , were virginbranded black tshirts \( 1 \) , guitar hero action figures \( 139 \) and a variety of jonas brothers memorabilia yet there were still some hidden gems mr beliech , the customer and former employee , scored cds by , among others , the british folkexperimental group current 93 and the hyperkinetic japanese band meltbanana max redinger , 14 , who was walking his dog , picked up some anime books and guitar hero figures he said he buys most of his music on itunes but still likes going to record stores and mentioned that a friend had recently introduced him to an independent shop upstate i do n't really buy stuff from it , mr redinger said , but it s a really cool place
looking for a mountain setting near manhattan to display ski equipment and apparel , macy s department store opened the mount peter ski area here in 1936 babe ruth came to ski , as did other celebrities seventythree years later , this familyowned ski area just over the border from new jersey welcomes about 50 , 000 visitors a year mount peter has been here a long time and struggled financially many years , but it never closed , said gail sampson , who along with her husband , don , has owned the ski area for 38 years now we have grandparents who learned to ski here bringing grandkids back to teach them to ski in connecticut , the mohawk mountain ski area in west cornwall has been run by the same family for decades there , the ski area s founder , walt schoenknecht , developed one of the country s earliest snowmaking systems , an invention that helped save the ski industry in the eastern united states it was funny growing up with a father who everyone thought was nuts for trying to make snow , said carol lugar , mohawk s current owner , as she stood in front of a photograph of her father , mr schoenknecht , holding what resembles an oversize garden hose a mist sprays from the hose , and snow is all around when he died in 1987 and snow making was on every ski area in the country , people thought he was a little less nuts , she said there are nearly a dozen ski areas in the new york metropolitan region , and given their proximity to the country s largest ski and snowboarding market , it is not surprising that they have played a major role in the history of american snow sports in sussex county , mountain creek is the biggest ski area in the metropolitan region and a snowboarders' haven it is used by two to three times the number of skiers and snowboarders as other nearby smaller mountains but it is the small , mostly familyrun ski areas in the region , with their rich histories , that remain the soul , spirit and financial future of the sport they are not only feeder systems for the larger ski areas of new england , new york and the rocky mountains , they are valuable community resources , affordable places of outdoor recreation and prized winter playgrounds where countless children are introduced to skiing and snowboarding when mount peter s don sampson first came to the ski area he would eventually own , it was 1966 , and the northeast was home to hundreds of small ski areas mr sampson , now 72 , ran mount peter s ski school he met his wife , gail , at a mount peter ski club meeting a few years later they have been married 40 years all spent in the ski business in 1971 , when it looked as if the mount peter ski center would close , the sampsons took out a small business loan and bought it the first winter we were owners it snowed like a banshee , said mrs sampson , 60 the place was packed , and we thought we were geniuses then it did n't snow for another six or seven winters , and boy , we were hurting to make ends meet , while running the ski area , mrs sampson worked in a bank and mr sampson had a construction business they lived in an apartment above the base lodge and raised two daughters there along the way , they held some other odd jobs and waited for the snowmaking and snowgrooming technology to get better and cheap enough that a small area \( mount peter has 10 trails , a fraction of the number at large ski areas \) could afford it in the next decade , dozens of small ski areas in new york and new england were shuttered but by the 1980s , the snow making and grooming had improved mr sampson said it once took him six days to cover a trail with manmade snow nowadays he can cover six trails in 24 hours business , however , remained unpredictable for small ski areas various gas and energy crunches kept people away , the weather was iffy , and more skiers seemed to be gravitating toward bigger mountains the sampsons considered yearly offers to sell the hillside that made up mount peter , especially since orange county , its location , was experiencing a housing boom as you get older you say , 'i could be on a florida beach right now instead of worrying about snowmaking temperatures or whether the soda dispenser is still working , ' mrs sampson said still , the sampsons never sold it s a crazy business , but this was our home , and we just could n't leave it , mr sampson said a lot of people came here and had fun we stayed because of our kids , who were happy and we thought they might want to run it someday in the 1990s , business started to rebound , and mount peter reinvested profits into snow making to ensure a more reliable product people who learned to ski at mount peter in the 1960s and '70s now had children , and when it came time for them to learn to ski or snowboard , they were drawn to the smallmountain environment they remembered we acknowledged our place in the business and focused on it , mrs sampson said and when you say you are a mom and pop place and cater to moms and dads , it all works a lot better the sampsons' daughters , rebecca sampson , 35 , and amy richardson , 33 , each went off to college , but they have now returned and are actively running the ski area
the ' old shrine still stands on 161st street in the bronx , dark and cold and gutted the october games that made it so famous have moved across the street , where the new yankee stadium hosted its first playoff game in style wednesday night the bright lights twinkled above the signature frieze , and three decks of seats thumped on a night when nearly everything went perfectly for the yankees they snuffed the , 72 , in the first game of their division series , benefiting from the kind of shutdown pitching they lacked in october for much of this decade the yankees scripted this after missing the playoffs last season they signed c c sabathia to be their ace , to overwhelm hitters when he had to they nurtured and kept homegrown arms like phil hughes , phil coke and joba chamberlain and they hoped that mariano rivera , as ever , would throttle their opponents it all happened in game 1 that s a great start for us , chamberlain said if you want to draw it up , that s the way c c went deep in the game and threw strikes and got big outs when he needed to guys got big hits it was a great start for everybody that included alex rodriguez , who shook his playoff slump with two runscoring singles both times , he drove in derek jeter , who hit in the third inning casey stengel , of all people , hit the first across the street , as a new york giant in the 1923 world series jeter s homer erased a 20 lead the twins had built in the top of the third against sabathia jeter , who reached base in all four of his atbats , now has as many postseason homers \( 18 \) as mickey mantle and reggie jackson that he has done it in many more games does not diminish his reputation it s almost like he takes it like it s just another day , said nick swisher , whose double in the fourth put the yankees ahead to stay but once the lights hit in the postseason , it s jeter time jeter helped the yankees win four world series at their old home , but none since 2000 their last three trips to the playoffs have ended in the first round , mostly because of poor starting pitching that was why the yankees signed sabathia and a j burnett , the game 2 starter for a combined 2435 million last winter sabathia had a shaky postseason history with cleveland and milwaukee , but the circumstances are different now the yankees found more rest for sabathia this season , and it paid off sabathia had 22 walks in 25 postseason innings before wednesday in the division series for the brewers last season , he walked the opposing pitcher , philadelphia s brett myers , as he crumbled in the early innings but he walked none this time ,  fatigue can manifest itself in a lot of ways , manager joe girardi said it can be lack of velocity , but usually it s lack of command and we saw his command tonight , it was pretty good sabathia was facing a twins team that won the american league central in 12 innings tuesday , beating detroit in a playoff and arriving at its manhattan hotel at 3 50 am wednesday but the twins did not seem tired , jumping on sabathia with a sevenpitch atbat and a leadoff double by denard span then sabathia did what the yankees pay him 23 million a year to do , generating strikeouts with runners in scoring position he fanned orlando cabrera and joe mauer with sliders , and a flyout ended the inning he struck out cabrera , which is very hard to do he s normally a pretty good contact guy , twins manager ron gardenhire said and he struck out joe mauer , which is really hard to do and that was c c he knuckled down and made some big pitches two of sabathia s 113 pitches crossed up jorge posada , who became the first catcher in 10 years with two passed balls in a division series game sabathia said one was his fault , and one was posada s in the first inning , posada said , he changed the signs with a runner on second and confused sabathia in the third inning , sabathia threw a different pitch than the one he had told posada i did n't know where the ball was , posada said i was just looking for the ball a run scored then , and the twins led by 20 but then jeter pulled a homer off the rookie brian duensing , and swisher doubled in his run the next inning in the fifth , with two on and jeter at second , duensing stayed in to face rodriguez , who had stranded the last 40 runners on base for him in the postseason duensing tried a firstpitch fastball that rodriguez stung to left for a hit the pitching coach , rick anderson , had warned duensing against doing that i said , let s just go right after him , ' duensing said he said

location muncie , ind nickname cardinals last year s ranking  no 56  what was said  ball state s toneddown nonconference schedule \( no nebraska or illinois \) should allow the cardinals to , at the very worst , cruise into a second consecutive bowl appearance for the first time in program history but is ball state good enough to wrestle away the west division , and the mac title , from central michigan \? well , yes , absolutely but i still have the team second in the west behind the chippewas but a secondplace finish in the west and over all in the mac should not be a disappointment to ball state fans the explosive offense will make the team one of the most exciting in the fbs and will give the talented skill players \( davis , hill , love \) the national attention they deserve i predict a 93 regular season but , unfortunately for the cardinals , a secondplace finish in the mac west reranking no 36 2008 record and recap \( 122 , 80 \) the best season in team history the cardinals romped through the regular season undefeated , rising as high as no 12 in the polls while only once scoring fewer than 31 points in a single game along the way , ball state averaged 377 points per game , only once winning by fewer than 10 points \( a 3124 victory over central michigan \) and running away with a mac west division that sent four teams to postseason play though the team s schedule \( weak \) prevented any legitimate discussion of breaking into the bcs , the cardinals entered the mac championship game against buffalo heavily favored , as well as aware that a 130 season and mac title would send the program to the most highprofile bowl game in its history one can pinpoint with almost perfect accuracy the moment when the season slipped away with four minutes left in the third quarter of the game against buffalo , allconference quarterback nate davis attempt at diving into the end zone resulted in a fumble the bulls returned 92 yards for a touchdown , turning what could have been a commanding 2414 bsu lead into a 2117 buffalo lead the bulls never looked back less than two weeks later , coach brady hoke \( 3438 in six seasons at ball state \) resigned his position to become the coach at san diego state , leaving the offensive coordinator , stan parrish , in charge two weeks after that , parrish and the cardinals suffered a 32point loss to tulsa \( by 4513 \) in the gmac bowl , and a team so recently on top of the world was brought hurtling back to earth high point you could pick any of the team s 12 regularseason wins let s go with the 3523 win over navy on sept 5 as the team s best nonconference victory , and wins over central michigan and western michigan \( by 4522 \) as the most memorable in mac play low point the pair of losses to end the season the far more devastating loss was the 4224 setback to buffalo in the mac championship , a game the cardinals gave away with five turnovers ball state outgained the bulls , 503 yards to 301 , had possession for 34 minutes 18 seconds and held buffalo to 39 on third down , yet still managed to lose would hoke have stayed for the bowl game if the cardinals had won the conference title \? if he had , would a job have stayed open long enough for him to be a candidate \? tidbit ball state outscored its opponents by 202 points in 2008 \( 489 points to 287 \) since the modern era \( 1936 \) , 38 ball state teams including four in the 1990s have failed to score 202 points in a single season needless to say , the team s 489 points scored \( an average of 349 per game \) was a school record tidbit \( coaching edition \) stan parrish has lost 27 of his last 28 games as head coach , dating to his threeyear stint at kansas state \( 198688 \) and including ball state s loss to tulsa in the gmac bowl the only bright spot was a 1717 tie against kansas on nov 7 , 1987 that game , known in some circles as the toilet bowl , pitted 08 ksu against 17 kansas \( out in the northwest , the 1983 oregonoregon state game is the one and only toilet bowl \) finally , a game that lived up to expectations in all , parrish s teams have been outscored , 453 to 1 , 257 , in his last 34

, entering his first full season as the ball state head coach ball state hired parrish shortly after hoke accepted the job at sdsu , hoping to give the program some muchneeded continuity after its recent success parrish has been a part of the ball state staff since 2005 , first as quarterbacks coach \( 2005 \) before adding offensive coordinator duties for the past three seasons the threeyear stretch from 2006 to 2008 saw the cardinals win 24 games , the program s most over three seasons since winning 27 from 1976 to 1978 \) this will be parrish s fourth head coaching job , and second on the fbs level his first position came at wabash college \( divisioniii \) , where he led the little giants to a sterling 4231 mark from 1978 to 1982 \( parrish obviously had the annexation of puerto rico in his playbook \) based on that success , parrish was hired by marshall not yet a member of the fbs where he went 1381 from 1983 to 1984 unfortunately , parrish then became the latest in a long line of accomplished coaches to be humbled by the monstrous rebuilding job at kansas state he went 2301 from 1986 to 1988 , including 0211 over his final two seasons after a oneyear hiatus from coaching , parrish spent six seasons as an assistant at both rutgers \( 199095 \) and michigan \( 19962001 \) with the wolverines , where he coached alongside the thendefensive line coach brady hoke , parrish was the quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator \( 20001 \) before coming to muncie , parrish s most recent coaching experience was a twoyear stint as the quarterbacks coach with the tampa bay buccaneers \( 20023 \) , a period that saw tampa bay win its first super bowl the gmac bowl loss may raise some eyebrows , but for a program reeling from the departure of its sixyear coach , such a performance should have been expected it s up to parrish , getting another coaching shot 20 years after his last gig fizzled , to keep the cardinals in the mix in the mac despite losing several key contributors to the program s success over the last two seasons returning starters 11 \( 4 offense , 7 defense \) key losses seven lost starters on offense , none more daunting than nate davis , the standout quarterback who opted to forgo his final year of eligibility and enter the nfl draft in 2008 , davis followed a recordsetting sophomore season \( 3 , 667 yards , 30 touchdowns \) with equally impressive numbers 3 , 591 yards and 26 scores while completing 643 percent of his passes , the latter of which marked a noticeable improvement over his previous two seasons he also continued to keep his interceptions low , tossing only eight in 401 attempts that gave him only 22 interceptions in 1 , 124 attempts on the college level davis also rushed for 312 yards as a junior , another career high while one could find fault with davis s decision to enter the nfl draft he went in the sixth round to the 49ers it is impossible to deny his importance to the program over the past three years the cardinals must also replace many of the team s top receiving targets , including allconference tight end darius hill a premier option in the passing game , hill finished with at least 40 receptions in each of his final three seasons , with career highs of 65 receptions , 926 yards and 11 scores as a junior he finished his career with 32 touchdown grabs , a school record sadly , ball state lost the services of its standout receiver dante love merely four games into the 2008 season , when he suffered a dreadful neck injury in the team s win over indiana in his stead , receiver louis johnson stepped up to post career highs in receiving yards \( 516 \) and touchdowns \( 6 \) four starters are lost off the offensive line tackles andre ramsey and robert brewster , right guard kyle cornwell and center dan gerberry the group combined to start 157 games , including 50 apiece by brewster and gerberry three linemen brewster , gerberry and ramsey earned firstteam allmac honors as seniors on defense , the cardinals lost both starting corners \( trey buice and kenny meeks \) and outside linebackers \( bryant haines and bj hill \) bj hill \( 77 tackles , 3 interceptions \) was a firstteam allconference performer as a senior a running back for his first two seasons at bsu , hill showed that running ability as a punt returner \( 127 yards per return , best on the team \) buice added another pair of interceptions , while haines a secondteam allmac pick finished third on the team in tackles with 86 \( 75 for loss \) haines was also finished tied for second with four sacks meeks led the way from his strongside linebacker spot with six sacks , part of his 48 total stops on the season players to watch no longer able to rely on davis , ball state will now look toward the senior miquale lewis to be the centerpiece of the offense as a junior , the firstteam allconference running back set school records in rushing yards \( 1 , 736 \) , touchdowns \( 22 \) and 100yard games \( 11 \) , while posting the nation s fifthbest per game average \( 124 yards \) it was a breakout campaign for lewis , who rushed for a combined 727 yards and 3 scores as a freshman and sophomore add in his 2008 total , and lewis currently sits sixth on ball state s career rushing list one , and only one , concern with lewis much like many ball carriers , lewis is prone to the occasional injury one injury , an acl tear in early 2007 , caused lewis to miss all but four games of his sophomore season though he did participate in all of ball state s 14 games last fall \( and had 322 carries \) , the cardinals cannot afford not to have lewis in the lineup though still unsettled , the quarterback position will most likely fall to the redshirt freshman kelly page can he be as productive as davis \? no , but the coaching staff likes his potential and , like davis , his ability to both pass and run the only quarterback on the roster with any game experience is the senior tanner justice , who has attempted six career passes \( completing five \) justice will be invaluable as a veteran voice for page , who has yet to take a college snap my own advice for page \? do yourself a favor and look early and often for the sophomore receiver briggs orsbon , who was a pleasant surprise as the team s leading receiver a season ago \( 68 for 813 yards and 5 touchdowns \) orsbon twice topped 10 receptions in a single game , including a mac championship gamerecord 13 receptions for 141 yards in the loss to buffalo what will be interesting to see in 2009 is how orsbon reacts to becoming a primary threat in the passing game , not one of a handful of cardinals who draw the attention of the opposition another option for page to work with is the senior tight end madaris grant , who finished his junior season tied for fifth on the team with 26 receptions grant started 12 games last fall and was an important part of the offense , mostly out of ball state twotight end set he will need to improve his production as a senior to replace hill full time as the no 1 tight end only one starter returns on the offensive line left guard michael switzer , owner of a 27game starting streak on the other hand , the bsu defensive line returns all four of its starters from 2008 , making it the most experienced unit on the team and the unquestioned strength of the defense there s experience , and then there s experience the senior end brandon crawford , a former marine two months short of his 33rd birthday , has the latter a thirdteam allmac pick as a junior \( a secondteam pick in 2007 \) , crawford finished the 2008 season with 31 tackles \( 8 for loss \) and 3 sacks at the other end , the junior robert eddins led all linemen with 45 tackles \( 65 for loss \) and 4 sacks bringing back both starting ends and interior linemen \( drew duffin and rene perry \) is a great omen for the bsu defense last fall s starting middle linebacker , davyd jones , will move to the weakside in 2009 the junior burst onto the scene last fall with 85 stops \( a teambest 12 for loss \) and 3 picks to replace haines and meeks , ball state will move the seniors spain cosby \( middle \) and sam woodworth \( strongside \) into the starting lineup both were important contributors a season ago while the cardinals lost their starting corners , the team does return both of its safeties it s a good pair the senior free safety alex knipp was a thirdteam allmac selection in 2008 , and the sophomore sean baker was the 2008 mac freshman of the year \( over orsbon , which is saying something \) as a junior , knipp led the team with 96 stops \( 35 for loss \) while adding a sack and 2 interceptions baker s terrific rookie season saw him finish second to knipp in tackles \( 94 , 4 for loss \) while posting a teamhigh six interceptions , three of which came in ball state s win over akron position battle to watch i m most interested in seeing how parrish goes about replacing four starters on the offensive line as mentioned , this quartet combined to start 157 career games and three were allconference selections as seniors making a normally difficult task perhaps unmanageable still , the staff feels good about the young talent on the offensive front switzer is expected to again hold down his left guard spot , and the sophomore center kreg hunter started four games at right guard as a rookie a third lineman with some game experience is the junior travis arnold , who is in competition for the starting right tackle job beyond that \? potential , and that s it austin holtz , a massive redshirt freshman , will push arnold for playing time at right tackle another redshirt freshman , steve yoder , is currently running no 1 at right guard fellow rookie dan manick is his only competition cameron lowery is penciled in to start on the left side , or move to the right if neither arnold or holtz holds his own , but the undersize redshirt freshman \( 255 pounds \) may need some help in the running game the cardinals have the makings of a solid offensive line in 2011 this fall it could struggle 2009 schedule  sept 3 north texas sept 12 new hampshire sept 19 army sept 26 auburn oct 3 toledo oct 10 temple oct 17 bowling green oct 24 eastern michigan oct 31 ohio nov 12 northern illinois nov 18 central michigan nov 24 western michigan game \( s \) to watch the games with central and western michigan to end the season i have that pair as the top two in the west division \( i don t think i m giving anything away here \) , so ball state will need to at worst split the two games if it wishes to repeat as division champs season breakdown prediction a soft nonconference schedule will allow ball state to enter mac play at 31 , as well as break in new contributors at several key positions this strong start will give the cardinals the opportunity , with an average mac finish , to return to bowl play for the third consecutive season one thing is for certain this team will not win 12 games again in 2009 there is too much uncertainty around the cardinals to expect even another west division crown , and , one could make the case , for the cardinals to even finish above 500 the coaching staff may be high on kelly page , but he won t be another nate davis , at least as a freshman the offensive line must be completely rebuilt the cornerback position will feature two new starters as much as any doubledigit win team from 2008 , the cardinals seem the closest to a rebuilding season truth be told , i m far from sold on parrish , though there has been nothing but positive feedback on the new coach since the start of spring practice too many question marks i predict no better than a 66 finish , with a slim chance of being bowl participants for the third straight year dream season new coach , new cast of characters , same result 102 , tops in the west nightmare season what we saw out of parrish and ball state in the gmac bowl carries

san antonio cierre wood has become accustomed to being jeered about his decision to attend  wood , a 6foot , 192pound tailback , has had people laugh in his face , crack jokes and mock him about his college choice some have even referred to the fighting irish as the lirish for their recent losing ways notre dame coach charlie weis was retained after a disappointing 76 mark this past season , but universities like ucla and washington continue to tell wood that he will play for another coach before the conclusion of his college career he anticipated none of those brickbats in april , when he committed to notre dame , the nation s most storied college football program i feel like we 're the nerd in college football , said wood , who is rated as the thirdbest tailback by  wood , from oxnard , calif , chose the irish over ucla he was among six notre dame commitments who participated in saturday s us army allamerican bowl , an annual game here for the nation s top high school seniors the east team beat the west , 3017 , behind three touchdown passes from tajh boyd of hampton , va , and two touchdown receptions by tailback bryce brown of wichita , kan boyd and brown were named the game s most valuable players boyd remains uncommitted to a college brown has committed to miami , but is still considering oregon while none of notre dame s recruits stood out in the game , its 2009 recruiting class is ranked 13th by  but that has hardly been an indicator of success for the fighting irish their 2008 and 2007 recruiting classes were ranked second and eighth in the past two seasons , notre dame has lost 15 games , the most it has ever lost in a twoyear span it s been going downhill basically , said wood , who had two carries for 6 rushing yards saturday wood said that weis was frank about notre dame s struggles during an inhome visit dec 2 earlier that day , weis met with notre dame athletic director jack swarbrick , who decided to retain him as coach we 've got to turn things around , wood recalled weis telling him that candor has resonated with other notre dame recruits like chris watt , a 6foot3 , 280pound offensive guard from glen ellyn , ill , who played in saturday s game weis has promised changes , but he did not elaborate on them , watt said he s trying to get the program back on two feet again , said watt , who is ranked as the nation s secondbest offensive guard by  when notre dame lost 15 starters from its 2006 team , which was beaten by louisiana state in the sugar bowl , the fighting irish assistant coach rob ianello told watt that the coaching staff had expected to rebuild for two seasons but the efforts have not gone as planned , because ianello figured both last year s and this year s teams would be no worse than 93 in the regular season , watt said it s not as far along as they 'd like to be , watt said this third year , they thought they 'd be up there competing for the national championship even with 14 starters returning , that type of optimism for next season may be too much but wide receiver shaquelle evans , another notre dame recruit , said he expected the fighting irish to win 9 or 10 games next season and reestablish themselves as a college football power the 6foot1 , 203pound evans , who is ranked as the sixthbest wide receiver by , proudly wore a blue ballcap with the gold nd logo on the field after the game the underside of the cap s bill said irish we 're going to secure coach weis s job , said evans , who had one catch for 4 yards anticipation for next season was building at notre dame before this past season ended during the season , the irish s starting quarterback , jimmy clausen , often sent to wood in which he wrote , ca n't wait for you to get here neither can wood he wants notre dame and weis to have the last laugh
the videos taken on my cambodia trip were taken by kassie bracken , a young woman who is a staff videographer for the times i thought that it would be interesting to get her perspective , since she hasn t been to the region before and since she is the same sex as the girls we interviewed in the brothels and not all that much older here s kassie s take i d never been to southeast asia before , nor had i ever stepped foot in a brothel i suppose the word summoned up grainy red images of numbered young girls for sale , but i don t know that i really knew what to expect each brothel we visited had a completely different energy and vibe , but for the most part , all of the girls seemed young the majority looked to be in their teens they were all tiny in stature too , which only made them seem even younger nick has asked me for my reflections in part to get a female perspective and this is difficult to put into words when i think about the moments we were in the presence of these girls i didn t see sexy or feminine , i saw adolescent energy , and that trumped anything else outside of one brothel a staunch mamasan never made eye contact with nick and looked past him , calculating the street as they spoke i was surprised that she continued speaking to us , knowing that it wouldn t lead to a sale behind her , young girls mechanically reapplied lipstick and mascara over and over again under red lights one woman s face will stay with me she kept circling lipstick around her lips with a desperation she d put the cap on and then open ten seconds later and do it again later that night we also spoke with a younger mamasan , heavily made up in a strapless cocktail dress with multiple gold rings and bracelets and long pressedon nails she and said she could fulfill a request for a virgin girl with a few days notice , and never lost her flirty smile when she spoke when we walked away she kept smiling and as we turned our backs she smashed three full beer bottles into the street behind us at both of those brothels , the girls had a deadness in their eyes that i sort of didn t want to contemplate for fear that i would become completely depressed about the world but at the karaoke shacks i was struck by the youth and energy in the laughter of some of the girls with whom we spoke the mood seemed lighter and i generally couldn t tell who the mamasans were for brief moments i would completely forget why we were there , and just see the enthusiasm of teenage girls talking to what probably appeared to them to be two odd westerners then it would hit me that like all of the other young women we d met , they would have to offer sex to the next man who wanted to pay two dollars no matter what he looked like , smelled like , or his physical manner it s difficult to imagine where i would be mentally and emotionally under those conditions i think in general , i felt emotionally abstracted from the girls in the brothels , in part because i never directly interacted with them and let nick handle the conversations and in a weird way , i think i didn t feel comfortable speaking i had this weird feeling that to speak was to somehow expose an inexplicable inequity namely all of the choices i ve had in my life in a world where many women by virtue of their gender have close to none i felt that to speak to them would somehow solidify that they were selling their bodies and i was not there was an older by older i mean , maybe 20 \? maybe 30 \? woman in a brothel in poipet where nick had conducted a sitdown interview with the mamasan during the course of the hour we were there , the woman had had sex with six men , for a total of perhaps 15 18 dollars she was beautiful high cheekbones and a slightly square face , thick black hair and dark eyes but she also looked like a tired woman at work as we were about to leave she looked me in the eye we just sort of looked at each other and took one another in and then she smiled at me i smiled back , awkwardly at the moment , i didn t know why i felt nervous , but i think now it s because it was one of the only moments of mutual vulnerability albeit brief and innocuous i felt on the entire trip i d like to think i am a fairly strong person , but in meeting long pross and hearing her tell her story , i wondered if i could ever match her strength long pross was the woman we did a video about who had been abducted in her cambodian village and sold into forced sexual slavery she d been beaten regularly , electrocuted , and had gotten pregnant twice she kept resisting her customers when after a painful abortion she d begged for a week off , the mamasan gouged her eye out with a metal shard during the interview she sat with sina van , who d also suffered sexual slavery and who seemed like a big sister to pross pross very rarely looked up during the interview , and sina would hold her and touch her hair as pross told her story it s been a week since cambodia , and i am thinking about it every day , and talking to friends willing to listen , just telling them what i saw i ve always thought that the concept of selling one s body is a tricky one i ve read a lot of comments on nick s blog saying that it s not the worst thing these women could be doing , given the extreme poverty in cambodia , and that he is overplaying the abuse angle ultimately , i wonder most not about the reality of a young girl in a sexual act with a paying stranger , but i wonder about the impact on that girl s future will she be able to be vulnerable to another human will she be able to experience love \? and i think about the end of nick s interview with pross sina was attempting to make pross smile by saying when we get your eye fixed up and get you beautiful again , we re going to find you a husband when i watch pross s expression in the video footage i see light in her eyes for the briefest moment then it s gone it s the moment from the trip that haunts me the most kassie bracken
thirteen games on saturday night , and some intriguing results but none more so than the one involving a certain legendary nordic player who has vowed that this season will be his last home teams listed first we begin in boston three straight ties for the isles , and in each they lose the minigame that follows here they lead by 30 with eight minutes left but let the bruins catch up , then lose the penalty shootout two goals for sidney crosby as leafs remain winless ilya kovalchuk nets his fifth goal in three games but the thrashers fall teemu sel nne scores twice in the third the second with 16 seconds left to singlehandedly earn a tie it s the second straight twogoal performance for the 39yearold finnish flash and then he scores the only goal in the shootout there may be no i in teemu , but for the ducks he s a oneman team devils outshoot panthers 4121 but need david clarkson s powerplay goal with 3 35 left to win this was almost the stanley cup final matchup last spring wings win a thriller on holmstrom s powerplay tally at 53 07 a hat trick for ryan malone jonathan quick kicks out 29 of 30 for kings in clash of nhl s longesttenured coaches , lindy ruff \( 12th season , 905 games \) beats barry trotz \( 11th season , 823 games \) mike grier s goal with 3 25 left breaks up a duel between the preds pekka rinne \( 41 saves \) and the sabres ryan miller \( 25 saves \) postgame penaltyshot contest goes nine rounds at the blackhawks home opener two points for chicago and one for the avs discounted tickets and winnipegstyle whiteout draw full house for bankrupt coyotes home opener but mathieu garon s 36save shutout silences the phoenix fans and probably kills hockey in the desert for good oil outshot by 3519 but nikolai khabibulin stops 33 patrick marleau scores nos 4 and 5 and evgeny nabokov turns aside 38 of 40 for sharks , the nhl s best home team last season
no one beats robin soderling 12 times in a row except possibly roger federer , who seems to have defeated the hardserving swede s number on grass , clay and hardcourts this match , scheduled for night session at arthur ashe stadium after melanie oudin faces caroline wozniacki , will be their third meeting in a major this year \( and 12th over all \) after federer dominated soderling in the final of the french open , and won a closer match in the fourth round at wimbledon the good news for soderling , seeded 12th , is that he continues to play well , eliminating a tough thirdround opponent in sam querrey he was up , two sets to one , against eighthseeded nikolay davydenko , who retired because of injury soderling has a big serve , powerful forehand and is not afraid to finish points at the net but his best weapon these days may be his head , something you couldn t say about soderling earlier in his career against the american querrey , soderling executed a nearperfect game plan , setting him up with slices and spins , then putting him away with forehand blasts and service winners the bad news for soderling is that federer is playing pretty well , too only lleyton hewitt seemed to be able to make federer , the world no 1 and reigning united states open champion , sweat a little after losing the first set , and making an uncharacteristic string of errors , federer went on to win the next three against hewitt in relatively routine \( which is to say , federeresque \) fashion he needed less than two hours to dispense of his fourthround opponent , 14thseeded tommy robredo of spain , in three uncompetitive sets  if soderling can serve well and keep the ball to federer s more vulnerable backhand side , he has a shot if not , well , there s always lucky 13 to look forward to caroline wozniacki \( 9 \) vs melanie oudin night session , 7 pm , arthur ashe stadium , espn2 it s hard to say if wozniacki s somewhat surprising victory over svetlana kuznetsova is good news for oudin or not kuznetsova , the 2004 champion and 2007 runnerup , would have stepped on court with all the pressure and expectations on her side of the net playing a newcomer who has nothing to lose it s a position that has rarely brought out the best in kuznetsova s game , as evidenced by monday night s festival of errors against wozniacki instead , oudin finds herself facing another young , talented player who has already surpassed expectations just getting to her first grand slam quarterfinals wozniacki has more experience and some impressive wins against top players , but was hardly expected to be in the position she is in when the tournament started wozniacki , a 19yearold from denmark , doesn t have exceptional speed , volleys , a big serve or overpowering ground strokes wozniacki wins by not losing , by keeping the ball in play and waiting for her opponents to miss through four rounds , wozniacki is averaging about eight unforced errors per set played an astonishingly low number for oudin , this match will be not only her first nonrussian opponent in the open , but the first player who doesn t win by hitting outright winners it s an interesting position to be in for the counterpunching oudin , who thrives by turning her opponents power against them that s how she has beaten three of the biggest hitters in the game , including 13thseeded nadia petrova on monday petrova was up a set and a break when oudin started to turn things around after missing her shots early in the match , oudin dug in and not only retrieved every ball petrova hit her way , she sent them back with more angle and pace eventually , petrova became frustrated and started overhitting , and from there oudin was able to take over the match she ll get none of that from wozniacki , so we ll see for the first time this tournament whether oudin can create winning shots without help from across the net novak djokovic \( 4 \) vs fernando verdasco \( 10 \) day session , not before 12 30 pm , arthur ashe stadium , espn2 if your idea of great tennis is two guys blasting ground strokes from the baseline , this is the matchup for you verdasco is a hardhitting spaniard whose mental game is just now starting to catch up to his physical skills unlike many of his countrymen , his game is suited quite well to the hardcourts of flushing meadows he has an outstanding forehand , passing shots and return game , as well as a serve that is nearly impossible for opponents to read verdasco won t blow away any of the top players with pure power , which is why his fiveset win over tommy haas in the third round was so impressive haas is one of the savviest players in the men s game , and was 20 against verdasco going in but verdasco stayed mentally tough throughout and pulled out a victory against john isner in the fourth round , verdasco executed his game plan brilliantly on his serve , verdasco mixed pace and spin to keep isner guessing where the next ball was going next on defense , he was able to pin isner to the baseline with crisp returns and clean passing shots djokovic , the 2007 runnerup , seems to have rediscovered his game here after an upanddown year on tour through four rounds , djokovic has been near perfect , destroying ivan ljubicic , carsten ball and radek stepanek in straight sets only the qualifier jesse witten was able to hurt djokovic , a 22yearold serb , then only for a single set djokovic wins with consistency , foot speed and precision shotmaking , all of which were on display in his dismantling of stepanek on monday night both djokovic and verdasco are playing great tennis right now , and that makes this matchup potentially quite competitive djokovic has the edge , but if verdasco plays the same patient , smart tennis he s been playing since this tournament began , he has a shot to get to his first open semifinals kateryna bondarenko vs yanina wickmayer day session , not before 12 30 pm , arthur ashe stadium , espn2 neither of these players has been past the third round of a major before , and wickmayer has been past the first round only once , at roland garros this summer this most unlikely of quarterfinals will be a battle of attrition from the baseline both players are good off both sides , and both move well around the court bondarenko has the edge in power , but wickmayer showed some impressive touch and even the occasional putaway at the net in her fourthround victory over petra kvitova still , with age and a bit more experience under her belt , bondarenko would seem to have the advantage here bob bryan mike bryan \( 1 \) vs lukas dlouhy leander paes \( 4 \) day session , not before 11 am , arthur ashe stadium , espn2 with so much attention paid to the stars at the top of the singles game , it s a shame that many of the best tennis players in the world toil in relative obscurity the bryan brothers have managed to break through , but opposite them in this matchup will be one of the very best doubles specialists ever , leander paes of india he has won more than 40 titles , including 9 grand slams in men s and mixed doubles and the 35yearold paes continues to play worldclass tennis he and his partner , lukas dlouhy , are the reigning french open champions and with cara black , paes won his ninth grand slam title at wimbledon black and paes are in the final here this semifinal matchup against the bryan brothers should feature some truly great play in an underappreciated part of the sport in the junior united states open junior matches are rarely scheduled on louis armstrong stadium , but wednesday s secondround boys match between australian bernard tomic and alex domijan of the united states features two players many feel are future stars the 18yearold domijan has been a hitting partner for the us davis cup team and is often mentioned by player development head patrick mcenroe as a player on the rise tomic , just 16 , has already reached 324th in the atp rankings and earned the no 3 seed in the boys championships here based on his professional performance domijan s forehand and tomic s backhand are worldclass shots that are definitely worth a look
the loan imbroglios that never seemed to end will end this week perhaps the kicktheball , kickthetires deals involving , in no particular order , david beckham , landon donovan , ac milan , bayern munich , major league soccer and the los angeles galaxy have supposedly mesmerized the soccer public and resulted in article after article of idle speculation and sheer fantasy the loans are scheduled to come to their conclusion when both players tuck their eurail passes and other old world goodies in their back pockets and return to southern california for the start of the 2009 mls season  first , that beckham guy sure , he wants to stay in italy s serie a \( who would not be energized to play surrounded by a collection of worldclass talent \? \) and sure , ac milan mouthed the right script when things were going swimmingly but now , ac milan is sliding toward a season without a trophy and coach carlo ancelotti s position is growing more precarious by the minute  after going unbeaten in six league games coming out of the winter break with beckham , 33 , planted on the right side of the midfield , milan is 121 in serie a in its last four games it was bounced out of the uefa cup by werder bremen in the middle of last week fourthplace milan trails inter by 12 points in serie a , a lead that appears insurmountable , especially after saturday s 21 loss at sampdoria in which becks left after 68 minutes so does an already aging squad need another aging superstar when the asking price is something like 10 million \? hey , milan is losing with beckham and can just as easily lose without him mls stood to make a nice little pocket change on the transfer , and now , in a perverse kind of way , is probably sorry that milan did not take the bait and take the talisman \( now there s a great brit cliche \) off its hands becks gets to go back to hollywood now and you can only wonder about the kind of reception he will receive around the league does anyone even care anymore \? after basically belittling mls , can beckham still be taken seriously \? if we see any becks jerseys on the racks at walmart we know the guy is toast perhaps the best take comes from none other than jose mourinho on his reborn show special 1 tv \( about 2 minutes 40 seconds into the clip \) and in germany , donovan saw 13 minutes of playing time sunday in bayern s desultory 00 draw at werder bremen , with the home team playing all but 15 minutes of the match with 10 men bayern has a 131 record in its past five bundesliga matches and now finds itself in fifth place , 5 points in back of hertha berlin  three games into his stay in germany , where donovan had said he hoped to stay , club officials said they could not justify buying the leading scorer in the history of the united states men s national team because mls was asking for too much money donovan has played mostly as a substitute in bundesliga matches , although he did get some props in exhibition matches as the club prepared to return to league play mls officials have apparently learned how to play hardball in this game of loan transfer chicken , pointing out that if the league pocketed a 10 million fee for the youngster jozy altidore from villarreal of spain , then surely the linchpin of the american national team was worth as much , if not more bayern would have none of it , pointing out that donovan , at 26 , has little chance to grow much more as a player , and besides , the club already has studs like luca toni and miroslav klose , so where would donovan fit in \? if matters keep going south in munich , not only will donovan be returning to california , but coach j rgen klinsmann may not be far behind so , who are the winners and losers in these loan deals \? is it just possible that mls played the game and garnered some muchneeded publicity , a la baseball s offseason hot stove league , with the constant speculation about donovan and beckham \? and what of the future of these loan deals \? should mls keep playing the game and will european teams continue to think they are dealing with a league run by dolts \?
from president obama to lawmakers to the public , rounds of condemnation have been unleashed about bonuses handed out by the american international group but none perhaps were as severe as remarks made by senator , republican of iowa , who demanded that american corporations adopt some of the ways of societies like japan , where leaders when shamed may publicly express deep regret or commit suicide in a conference call with iowa reporters on tuesday , mr grassley tried to clarify the remarks he first made on monday to a radio station there , saying he was not calling for corporate executives to commit suicide but he still offered up the example of harakiri as he denounced the lack of accountability by corporations receiving bailout money what i'm expressing here obviously is not that i want people to commit suicide , that s not my notion , mr grassley said i do feel very strongly that we have not had statements of apology , statements of remorse , statements of contrition on the part of ceo s of manufacturing companies or banks or financial services or insurance companies that are asking for bailouts that they understand that they are responsible for running their corporation into the ground and now they 're coming to the taxpayers for help and have been coming to the taxpayers for help for the last six months and it s very difficult for the american people to understand the justification for it mr grassley said public apologies by japanese officials showed that they accept full responsibility , and the entire society knows they accept full responsibility without such expressions of remorse , he said , it just makes it very difficult for the taxpayers of my district to just keep shoveling money out the door
lviv , it is not immediately clear why should be a candidate for president of ukraine a former customs official from the western city of ivanofrankivsk , he subscribes to no particular ideology , has the flimsiest of platforms and does not plan to tour the country before the vote , reasoning that these trips cost a great deal and the people are sick of them in fact , he could have vanished into this winter s overpopulated presidential race had he not , on oct 2 , legally changed his last name to protyvsikh , ukrainian for against everyone though few see mr protyvsikh as a serious candidate , he reflects the sour mood that has swelled in the electorate and one that could swing a pivotal presidential election in january for years , the vote in ukraine has been almost evenly divided between the industrial russianspeaking east of the country , whose voters generally favor closer ties with moscow , and intent on pursuing a european path the is almost certain to narrow for a closely fought second round of voting between these two constituencies , in the form of former prime minister , from the east , and the current prime minister ,  but while mr yanukovich s voters have the incentive of reclaiming kiev , deep disillusionment has settled in the west , home of the orange revolution it is not yet clear whether that feeling runs so deep that voters will stay home , or as mr protyvsikh clearly hopes go out of their way to cast a protest vote everyone s disappointed in politicians , said vladimir zuyenko , 44 , a security guard who said he had gone three months without pay they made this revolution , but they did n't solve anything we were poor then , and we 're still poor the only reason to vote is that if we do n't , someone else will vote for us five years ago , euphoria surged through this city , the first in ukraine to declare viktor a yushchenko president , on the eve of the orange revolution so many people piled onto buses headed for kiev to support the prowestern coalition that streets were left halfempty , and those who stayed wore bits of orange in solidarity viktoria gnip , 35 , said she was so inspired that she vowed on the spot to name her unborn baby yulia or viktor , after the two heroes of the day even recalling that happiness seems painful in lviv \( pronounced luhveev \) these days voters complain about the bitter public infighting between mr yushchenko and ms tymoshenko , about cronyism in local appointments , about an underfinanced health care system and about an economy so miserable that doctors and teachers leave for menial jobs in western europe people had hope then , darya lobachevskaya , 63 , said it lasted for a year , maybe two years but then , wherever it came from , it went back there as this mood has deepened , the proportion of ukrainians who tell pollsters they will vote for none of the above one option on the ballot has been edging up , from 4 percent in 2004 to around 8 percent now , said oleksiy antypovych , of , who works out of kiev and lviv by the time voters go to the polls , that percentage drops by onehalf , so it has never proved decisive in an election , he said but the none of the above votes are much higher when respondents are asked about the second round of this winter s election , with 18 percent answering that they would not vote for either mr yanukovich or ms tymoshenko even if half of that group ends up staying home or making a choice between the candidates , up to 10 percent of ukrainians may vote for none of the above , mr antypovych said that would set a precedent , he said the protest vote , in this case , could be decisive current data shows that 40 percent of voters would back mr yanukovich in a second round , and 30 percent would back ms tymoshenko , mr antypovych said though ms tymoshenko is likely to pick up many orange votes from four firstround candidates with similar platforms among them mr yushchenko it is not yet clear if the old coalition will rally around her when she most needs it or what will happen if the results are disputed one thing i can say with certainty there will be no repetition of that revolution , mr antypovych said people will no longer go out into the streets for a politician they simply will not go out based on our surveys , most voters expect there to be mass falsification they are already accustomed to the idea it was against this backdrop that mr protyvsikh , 63 , began his quixotic campaign in his handful of public appearances , he has stuck closely to his simple slogan , explaining that he does not subscribe to any particular ideology \( elect me , and then i 'll explain everything , he added , reassuringly \) amid speculation that he was injected into the race to sabotage another candidate , he said his financing came from my friends , who are scattered all over the world , rich ones , my relatives , my fellow villagers mostly , he answers questions about his last name i made this decision six months ago , because i had reached the end of my patience , he said in a telephone interview i will stand in the breach i am brave , i am independent i changed my name to express the will of all the people many , many in ukraine who are against everyone andrei mikitin , a journalist from mr protyvsikh s home town of ivanofrankivsk , said the against everyone campaign has provoked mostly chuckles at home when push comes to shove , he said , however disappointed western ukrainians are in the orange leadership , they will be roused by the desire to vote against mr yanukovich , if only because moscow backs him you have to understand people here , said mr mikitin , editor in chief of the newspaper western ukraine people do n't need against everyone' they need an against russia' or an against putin'

it is babe ruth , but maybe not lou gehrig it is probably 1928 and it may just be sept 9 , part of a doubleheader against the philadelphia athletics at yankee stadium , rather than an october world series game against the st louis cardinals a newly discovered home film acquired by major league baseball productions shows ruth playing the outfield , a first for the vast movingimage archive it also shows ruth striking out on a check swing , arguing with an umpire and walking away while dragging his bat through the dirt on friday , the new york times wrote about baseball s archive and the ruth film , which archivists at major league baseball had not taken the time to give more than a glance they simply noted several clues that led them to think it was shot in 1928 the times asked readers to help play archaeologist , uncovering all the video s clues to determine when the film was shot and who the yankees' opponent was that sunny day the response from athome historians was deep and the speculation wide many shared their knowledge of box scores , uniform designs and yankee stadium history , and took stabs at various dates and opposing teams but none gave it the full scrub like keith olbermann , the msnbc broadcaster and baseball blogger , and tom shieber , a senior curator at the national baseball hall of fame and museum in cooperstown , ny the two , working separately , came up with the same conclusion they believe that the game in question took place on sunday , sept 9 , 1928 probably nick trotta , the manager of library licensing for major league baseball productions , said archivists would not be able to devote their attention to the clip until after the world series , but did not dismiss olbermann and shieber we have n't been able to fully process their alike conclusions , trotta said in an email message but i think they 're going about it in the right way olbermann and shieber agree that one quick glance reveals that the game was not on opening day , during the world series \( when the yankees beat the cardinals in 1928 \) or on july 4 that is because there is no bunting the yankees loved bunting , and still do , festooning the stadium for all big games yet this must have been a big day of some sort , because the stands were unusually packed olbermann found that the biggest crowds of the year that season were on july 1 , aug 19 and sept 9 newspaper accounts and a box score said that 85 , 000 were in attendance on sept 9 the opposing team appears to be wearing lightcolored caps olbermann , citing marc okkonen s book baseball uniforms of the 20th century , said that only four teams in 1928 had such caps the browns , the red sox , the white sox and the athletics lightcolored caps and a huge crowd \? sept 9 became the leading candidate further cementing that conclusion are box scores that show that ruth struck out in both games of the doubleheader and played right field that day shieber used some other clues , including socks he concluded that the only road uniform that matched the film belonged to the a s but he also believed that the player on deck , patiently watching ruth s poststrikeout demonstration , was not lou gehrig , but bob meusel shieber s research shows that the only time that season that gehrig hit before ruth , and not after him , was from aug 25 to sept 20 sure enough , the sept 9 , 1928 , box scores on retrosheetorg showed that gehrig batted in front of ruth that day , and meusel followed the yankees and the a s also played at yankee stadium on sept 11 and 12 , but attendance figures were much lower , further pointing to a sunny sunday afternoon of sept 9 in his research on friday , shieber found an old panoramic image of yankee stadium in the hall of fame s national baseball library it is labeled as being shot from right field during the 1928 world series between the yankees and the cardinals demonstrating how tricky it can be to determine the origin of archival footage and photographs , and the folly of presumptions and concrete conclusions , shieber noted , through the study of uniforms , that the right fielder was clearly not a yankee or a cardinal it appears to be an athletic and the stadium , sans bunting , appears to be packed shieber sees it is a wonderful coincidence that the archived photograph and the newly uncovered home movie were shot on the same day
gunmen opened fire outside a military barracks saturday night , killing two men and injuring four others in the first attack of its kind in more than a decade , the police in northern ireland said no one immediately claimed responsibility for the shootings , which took place at massereene barracks northwest of belfast , but suspicion is likely to center on dissident republican groups opposed to the irish republican army s ceasefire witnesses said the gunmen struck at the main gate of the massereene army barracks in antrim as a group of soldiers and civilian army staff members were collecting pizzas from a deliveryman gunmen who apparently had been following the deliveryman raked the group with assaultrifle fire , then sped off politicians from both the british protestant majority and irish catholic minority blamed irish republican army dissidents , although none of the ira splinter groups claimed responsibility both sides vowed that the bloodshed would not undermine their 22monthold coalition , the central accomplishment of a 1998 peace accord the police service of northern ireland said the two who were killed were soldiers , while those wounded were two soldiers and two civilian army employees the massereene barracks is the northern ireland headquarters for the army s royal engineers the attack came a day after northern ireland s police commander , hugh orde , confirmed that an elite army unit that specializes in electronic surveillance had begun to help the police monitor ira dissidents because of growing fears of an attack the last northern ireland killing of a soldier happened in february 1997

the gun lobby and its alltoowilling political accomplices have struck again the senate s version of urgently needed legislation to protect credit card users has been saddled with a dangerous and utterly nongermane amendment allowing visitors to openly carry loaded firearms into national parks and wildlife refuges a disappointing 27 senate democrats , whose party once led the fight for gun control , eagerly signed on with 39 republicans fawning together before the lobby s lethal diktat none of that 66 dared to ask what on earth does laissezfaire gun toting have to do with credit card fairness \? and why should the national parks , which are supposed to be peaceful preserves , be filled with loaded ak47s and other war weapons \? the house has passed a gunfree credit card measure , and members must muster the courage to strip this amendment from the senate s version the gun lobby already has poisoned the proposal to let the district of columbia have a voting representative in the house the senate s gun lackeys tacked on a vindictive amendment to strip the district of basic gun control powers , inviting assault and sniper rifles designed for military battlefields into homes and businesses the house passed its own clean version of the district of columbia bill , but the lobby is threatening retaliation if members dare to do their duty and strip guns from the final version negotiated with the senate turning the national parks into fields for firearms has been an obsession of the gun lobby the bush administration catered with disgraceful regulations that had to be struck down in federal court for ignoring public safety and environmental standards the obama administration has been hedging on the issue , as if further review might justify a terrible idea and now senator tom coburn , a republican of oklahoma , happily rehauls the same water , imposing it on to the vital credit card bill senator coburn is hinting that he may have more lockandload mischief ready for the next big bill that comes along this raises a bigger question who is running the senate \? apparently , and shamefully , the gun lobby
portland , ore in the space of a few seconds , in the narrow space between four defenders in a packed lane , brandon roy darted and elevated , changed hands and flipped the ball over the rim as the final buzzer sounded sunday , proving once more that a transcendent player can change everything it was not a reminder that the needed they had been bullied last week by kobe bryant and lebron james and then by the boston celtics , and they went on the road looking for a little reprieve it was within their grasp sunday , until roy the ' acrobatic young guard sliced through the knicks' defense for a dazzling layup and a 109108 victory the knicks have absorbed bigger defeats , but perhaps none as painful they had turned a 17point deficit into a 13point lead they held a 7point advantage with 1 minute 54 seconds to play but they could not score in the final minute , and they could not stop roy from driving through their entire defense with the game on the line after spending a week finding silver linings in every loss , the knicks' supply of happy thoughts was tapped out this one hurts , coach mike d'antoni said the blazers \( 3119 \) had pulled within a point in the final minutes on a tipin by greg oden and a jumper by travis outlaw the knicks had their chances to pad the lead , but david lee failed to convert twice on a driving dunk attempt that was disrupted by oden and a 9footer that simply missed al harrington also missed a tough driving layup so the game came down to one possession , 43 seconds and roy he took the inbounds pass from rudy fern ndez , drove past jared jeffries and lee and rolled the ball toward the rim the rose garden roared the knicks \( 2129 \) did not wait for the official review and quickly shuffled off the court he came in and made a really good play , jeffries said the knicks had a foul to give , but d'antoni chose not to , worrying that roy could anticipate the foul and attempt a shot , thus putting him at the line his players echoed that concern you 've got to be careful in that situation , jeffries said he might pull up and shoot at any time so the knicks lost their fourth game in a row , all to playoffcaliber teams , putting a crimp in their newfound confidence it had otherwise been a thrilling afternoon for the knicks they made 14 3pointers , 10 in the second half , when they wiped out the 17point deficit in one stretch from the third to the fourth quarter , they outscored the blazers by 377 they led , 9784 , with 8 08 to play but portland proved resilient outlaw scored on a dunk and a pair of 3pointers , and lamarcus aldridge hit two jumpers to fuel the late comeback outlaw finished with 23 points off the bench lee led the knicks with 29 points and 11 rebounds nate robinson and harrington each had 19 points danilo gallinari made his first nba start , although the occasion was overwhelmed by the final score starting gallinari made sense for a lot of reasons , but d'antoni boiled it down to one simple thought i just think it s time d'antoni also started wilson chandler , the promising secondyear swingman , giving the lineup a decidedly futureoriented look d'antoni did not say how long the new alignment would last , but he had been impressed by gallinari and was eager to give him more responsibility still , the knicks leaned hard on their veterans sunday , and gallinari played a limited role scoring 6 points in 14 minutes chandler had 4 points neither played in the fourth quarter until chandler came in for the final possession the blazers got big contributions from all three of their young stars roy scored 19 points , aldridge had 16 points and oden dominated the paint with 17 points , 12 rebounds and a careerhigh 6 blocks oden blocked three shots in the third quarter , when the blazers stretched their lead to 7760 the knicks responded with one of their most impressive rallies of the season a 201 burst over 4 18 seconds that gave them their first lead since the first quarter chris duhon , tim thomas and robinson combined for five 3pointers in the rally , and lee added a 3point play as the knicks took the lead , 8078 but tight games are often decided by allstars like roy , and the knicks are still short in that department i guess i just do n't want to go there yet , d'antoni said because i thought we played well enough we had our looks , we had shots that we did n't make , we had a couple rebounds we could n't quite get and it cost us rebounds one of the reasons mike d'antoni decided to start danilo gallinari was to keep his sore back from tightening up after pregame warmups gallinari said he held up fine he spent his nonplaying minutes laying in front of the knicks' bench as long as i do n't sit , i feel pretty good , he said so i just have to go lay down or stand up gallinari said he would be able to play both nights of this week s backtoback set against golden state and the los angeles clippers
washington the ethics case against senator of alaska was to be a signal achievement for the justice department s elite anticorruption unit , for decades the lead prosecutors on the nation s highestprofile cases but in the aftermath of the collapse of the conviction last week , lawyers poring over the wreckage said they believed the case had been poorly managed and inadequately supervised , lacked sufficient resources and been hampered by conflicts between prosecutors and agents going back months even before attorney general moved last week to throw out the conviction , the trial record was filled with instances of serious prosecutorial mistakes that dismayed the large corps of washington lawyers who followed the case , including former prosecutors and defense lawyers most alarming to these lawyers was the prosecutors' repeated failure to disclose information that might have helped the defense despite the sanctity in which lawyers are taught to hold those obligations in an example of the disarray of the government team , one fbi agent said in an affidavit that as many as 30 boxes of unsorted evidence sat outside a prosecutor s office as the trial was to begin the prosecution team was split between lawyers from alaska and members of the public integrity unit in washington , and they sometimes disagreed washington sent in a lead prosecutor late in the investigation , rankling lowerlevel lawyers even more the most important question that remains largely unanswered , said officials and veteran lawyers , is whether the corner cutting , especially the serial concealment of information damaging to the government , was a result of flawed judgments and heavy workloads or an intentional step by prosecutors to increase their chances of a highprofile conviction the officials and lawyers who spoke about the case were granted anonymity because the department s office of professional responsibility is investigating the case and could recommend sanctions for some of the prosecutors none of the trial team prosecutors would comment on the case one fbi agent , chad joy , has said in an affidavit that he sat in on meetings in which stevens prosecutors were clearly aware that they were ignoring their professional obligations to turn over materials that the defense could use to counter the charges agent joy , who still works for the bureau , took the unusual step of asking the government for official protection as a whistleblower his 10page affidavit has become an important part of the collapse of the case the problems with the stevens case became glaringly apparent during the trial when the judge , emmet g sullivan of federal district court here , admonished prosecutors after government lawyers sent a witness back to alaska without notifying the judge or the defense still , mr stevens was convicted on oct 27 on seven felony counts that victory was shortlived shortly after he was sworn in as attorney general on feb 3 , mr holder took the unusual step of removing the entire stevens trial team from the case and replacing those lawyers with three new prosecutors last week , after discovering yet another instance of what the justice department concluded had been misconduct by the original prosecution team , mr holder said he would seek to drop all charges judge sullivan is expected to approve the motion to dismiss in a hearing scheduled for tuesday the public integrity section of the justice department has about three dozen prosecutors , most of them career government lawyers they are charged with overseeing and advising on the prosecutions of governors , mayors and legislators , since the justice department gave them sweeping authority over corruption inquiries to make sure they were untainted by political influence in washington , they conducted the biggest cases , including the investigation of the lobbyist jack abramoff , which rocked capitol hill now the justice department is examining whether senior managers , including members of the public integrity unit , were lax in monitoring the prosecutors and how such a significant case could have gone so far awry without senior officials' stepping in one specific issue is whether the department was at fault for failing to pick up on the struggles of a trial team of five principal lawyers that may have been overwhelmed , struggling in the face of tight deadlines and an aggressive defense team from williams connolly , a law firm known for its combativeness , according to current and former justice department officials prosecutors were particularly hardpressed because mr stevens surprised them by asking for a speedy trial , rather than seeking a delay as expected the prosecutors under scrutiny include highly regarded government lawyers with long experience trying corruption cases one is brenda morris , the chief trial lawyer , who jousted with mr stevens during his several hours on the stand , and with the chief defense lawyer , brendan sullivan also under investigation is william m welch ii , the interim head of the public integrity unit who rushed over to take control of the case in early october after the judge strongly criticized the government s erratic behavior , saying he had lost confidence in the public integrity unit one of the trial lawyers implicated in several instances of alleged misconduct and concealing documents was nicholas marsh , a public integrity lawyer who was assigned to aid in the alaska prosecutions of several state legislators , cases that grew out of the investigation that snared mr stevens mr stevens , the longestserving republican in the senate s history , was narrowly defeated just days after his conviction of seven counts connected to his failure to disclose on senate ethics forms as much as 250 , 000 in goods and services lawyers familiar with mr holder s deliberations in the case said that even before he took office , he was dismayed by the mistakes and the public scoldings prosecutors had received from judge sullivan , a longtime friend of mr holder a critical factor for mr holder in deciding to drop the case , the officials said , was the discovery by the three freshly assigned prosecutors of a new instance of improper concealment of information from the court and the defense team the episode involved an interview on april 15 , 2008 , in anchorage by four prosecutors and an fbi agent the interviewee was bill allen , who was to be the government s chief witness a senior justice department official said that notes of mr allen s account given in the interview were highly relevant on at least two points that the prosecution team should have known had to be turned over to the defense under longstanding basic trial rules the government had charged mr stevens with failing to list the 250 , 000 in goods and services , largely from mr allen , who had made millions as an oil service contractor during alaska s oil boom what made the failure to turn over notes of the meeting different from the previous instances of withholding evidence , a senior department official said , was that it was discovered in february , after the trial was over all of the previous examples of problems in turning over information occurred during the trial , and judge sullivan tried to remedy the impact by , for example , excluding some evidence from the jury but as to the discovery of notes about the april interview , there was no way for the judge to impose any remedy , because the trial had already happened and the defendant was convicted , the senior official said
baghdad more than a month has passed since an iraqi television reporter threw his shoes at president bush during a baghdad news conference held to highlight what mr bush called a successful american military effort to pacify  the journalist , , 29 , who was immediately arrested , has been allowed only two visitors and none since dec 21 , according to those close to him his family and his lawyer say that they do not know where he is being held and that they are gravely concerned about his wellbeing because they have not been allowed to speak with him by telephone on thursday , dhiyaa alsaadi , mr zaidi s lawyer , said he had recently seen medical records that were part of mr zaidi s court file , which he said added credence to the journalist s claim that he had been beaten and tortured after his arrest by the security detail of the iraqi prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , on dec 14 mr saadi said two medical reports conducted by government physicians within a week of mr zaidi s arrest described bruising that covered the reporter s face and body , but was especially severe on his legs and arms a missing tooth a gash on the bridge of his nose and what appeared to be a burn mark on his ear mr saadi said he had not been permitted to remove the records from the office of the judge investigating the case , so the existence of the documents could not be verified independently but the account of mr zaidi s wounds matches injuries described by one of mr zaidi s brothers after his prison visit last month uday alzaidi , 33 , the brother , said thursday that he feared that mr zaidi , who faces up to seven years in prison for the criminal charge of aggression against a visiting head of state , might never emerge from government custody i do n't know his fate , said mr zaidi i am sure they will kill him in prison but dr fadhil mohammed jawad , the legal adviser for mr maliki , said thursday that mr zaidi had not been tortured and would receive a fair trial judicially , iraq is just and the law will handle this case with justice , dr jawad said a trial date for mr zaidi had been scheduled for dec 31 , but was delayed at the request of his lawyer , who is seeking a reduced charge with a shorter prison term a new date has not been set the shoehurling episode took place during a news conference with mr bush and mr maliki in baghdad s heavily secured green zone mr zaidi rose from his seat , threw a shoe at mr bush and shouted , this is a gift from the iraqis this is the farewell kiss , you dog ! mr zaidi threw his second shoe at the president before security guards restrained him both shoes missed as he was pulled from the room by the guards , mr zaidi was seen being beaten in iraq , throwing a shoe at someone is considered a grave insult but mr bush s unpopularity here made mr zaidi an instant celebrity and folk hero , not only in iraq but also elsewhere in the arab world mr maliki was acutely embarrassed , however , and several days later , he said mr zaidi had been put up to the act by a man the prime minister described as a head cutter apparently a reference to a member of the sunni extremist group al qaeda in mesopotamia , known for beheading people mr zaidi s family , however , has insisted that the reporter has no ties to any political group and that he acted solely out of his opposition to the americanled invasion of iraq in 2003 since his arrest , the reporter has been seen by only a few people , including one visit each by his lawyer and brother , both on dec 21 subsequent visit requests have been rejected or ignored by the government and the judiciary , the men said it remains unclear who is responsible for clearing visits to mr zaidi while dr jawad , the prime minister s legal adviser , said such matters were handled by the investigating judge and the suspect s lawyer , a spokesman for the judge said the issue was one reserved for the executive branch during a telephone interview , abdul sattar albiriqdar , the spokesman for the high judicial council , which administers iraq s court system , said dhiyaa alkinani , the investigating judge , had not been aware that mr zaidi s lawyer and family members had repeatedly sought to visit mr zaidi in prison at first , mr biriqdar denied knowing mr zaidi s whereabouts , but later he said mr zaidi was at an iraqi detention center in the green zone operated by the baghdad brigade , a military unit that answers to the prime minister s office mr biriqdar said anyone who sought to see mr zaidi would be permitted to do so but during a recent visit to the complex , an iraqi army guard told a reporter who requested a visit to leave immediately the guard also said it was dangerous to seek to meet mr zaidi the soldier , who did not identify himself , said he did not know whether mr zaidi was being held there on thursday , an email message sent to mr maliki requesting a visit with mr zaidi received no reply mr biriqdar , the judicial spokesman , said that mr zaidi had not told the investigating judge about being tortured or beaten while in custody and that during a meeting with mr zaidi last month the judge had seen no signs of physical abuse the investigating judge said he had not noticed if he had been tortured or beaten , mr biriqdar said muntader did not say he was beaten and did not ask to be referred to a medical committee but a few days after that meeting , both mr zaidi s lawyer and brother uday said during their respective visits that it had been clear that mr zaidi had been beaten
cowboys \( 85 \) at saints \( 130 \) saturday , 8 20 pm line saints by 7 a win last week bought the saints a firstround bye in the playoffs a loss bought the cowboys six more days of december slump story lines pity the poor players , who cannot escape the seasonal criticism they are starting to twitch like department store clerks who can t escape jingle bell rock the cowboys lack of goalline creativity against the chargers suggests that they may be running out of new ideas every week you call about 70 plays and you probably want about 10 of them back , the offensive coordinator jason garrett said , not making it clear whether marion barber s doomed offguard plunges count as one play or four the special teams problems are equally unsolvable the cowboys asked the kickoff specialist david buehler to challenge nick folk , who is 5of14 beyond 40 yards , but buehler missed three straight 35yard kicks in practice undaunted , the team gave him four more tries the next day  with no kicker , an offensive coordinator who is skipping like an old scratched record , and the superstar defender demarcus ware questionable after a frightening neck injury , jerry jones was moved this week to tell a story about the great depression by his chronology , it occurred in 1978 about 10 years before i bought the cowboys , i was renting a car at love field , and they cut my credit cards up when i handed them a card to rent a car so i know what hard times are like in dallas you get the impression that the guy who cut the card now cleans gnats out of the cowboys stadium scoreboard the times wouldn t be as hard in dallas had jones retained sean payton , the former cowboys assistant who turned the saints around payton probably doesn t call the same play four times in a season dolphins \( 76 \) at titans \( 67 \) sunday , 1 pm the colts have clinched the playoffs , the chargers and bengals are each just a win away the patriots are the likely winners of the afc east , and the broncos face the raiders and chiefs in upcoming weeks , making them wildcard favorites that leaves seven teams vying for one playoff berth it will be a mad , mad , mad , mad scramble in the weeks to come the dolphins are in better position than most of the other hopefuls , flying over much of the competition like sid caesar in a biplane they have crucial headtohead tiebreaker victories against the jaguars and jets , and they face three straight bubble brethren in the upcoming weeks the titans , with a weaker conference record , are more like jonathan winters on a bicycle to make the playoffs , both teams must not only keep winning , but get help , which is footballspeak for a gordian tangle of losses \( or ties \) by other teams that can only be explained by an actuary with the commissioner on speed dial the titans , of course , were 06 before vince young s resurrection , and kerry collins looked refreshed in relief of the injured young last week the dolphins keep cobbling offense together out of ricky williams and a bunch of guys named brian hartline and lousaka polite they were up to their old tricks against the jaguars , rushing 40 times and crawling down the field at 10 yards per minute the titans have become a tough team to run against in the second half of the season , which gives them a big edge this week it may be too little , too late for the playoff chase everybody wants the giant w at the end of the season , but peyton manning will probably just walk away with it , spencer tracystyle bengals \( 94 \) at chargers \( 103 \) sunday , 4 05 pm line chargers by 6 1 2 the bengals have battled tragedy all season the defensive coordinator mike zimmer s wife died suddenly two months ago now , the team is coping with the death of chris henry days before one of the most important games in franchise history henry s onfield contributions this season were minimal \( henry broke his forearm in november \) but his significance to the organization was great henry was emblematic of the type of secondchance player the bengals often acquire , usually to great criticism he was one of several players who appeared to be turning his career around while playing for the bengals , and henrylike players troubled , misunderstood , tooquickly judged by some critics are largely responsible for the team s success this season on the field , the bengals match up well with the chargers they run the ball 52 percent of the time , so they can control the clock and limit opportunities for the quickstrike chargers offense cornerbacks leon hall and johnathan joseph are the best duo in the league with all due respect to darrelle revis and anyone available allowing the bengals to contain chargers receivers who average a leaguehigh 137 yards per catch it s callous to speculate on the motivation factor in this game , yet foolish to overlook it a win clinches the postseason for either team suddenly , that seems trivial packers \( 94 \) at steelers \( 67 \) sunday , 4 15 pm line steelers by 1 1 2 the packers and steelers switched places on nov 15 before that day , the packers were like the smart kid who never studied brilliant in bursts , foolish at the worst times , always defeating themselves with sacks and penalties the steelers were diligent students reliable , resourceful , capable of a bplus effort every week and an a on the february final exam the packers are 50 since nov 15 they still find a way to commit pass interference on an extra point , but the packers have allowed only 10 sacks in five games , and their blitzhappy defense has forced enough mistakes to offset the occasional \( frequent , incessant \) flags the steelers are 05 , with three losses to bad opponents their offensive game plans are predictable , their special teams are awful and , most shockingly , their blitzes have become easy to pick up and exploit with their dom capers defense and goforbroke quarterback , the packers are the new steelers it s only appropriate that the real steelers lose to themselves one more time falcons \( 67 \) at jets \( 76 \) sunday , 1 pm mark sanchez practiced with braces on both knees this week any more injuries and he ll be fitted

to ride motorcycles , and james caan will quarterback the vikings rex ryan and mike smith , former coworkers who spent the week ribbing each other through the media , could certainly get behind the idea of blitzing bikers a quick rooting guide for jets fans you want the titans to beat the dolphins , because the jets hold a tiebreaker against the titans you want the bengals to win , because that means they may have less to play for in week 17 you can root for the raiders and rams if you enjoy frustration , and you can hope that randy moss sails back to gold brick island for another week , because there s still a very slim chance of a division title bears \( 58 \) at ravens \( 76 \) sunday , 1 pm line ravens by 10 1 2 the ravens elfin playmakers survived brief scares on sunday ray rice

this week , and the ravens relatively easy lateseason schedule the raiders and steelers follow the bears give them an inside edge among the afc bubble buddies the bears are eliminated from the

carried a double latte out of the huddle when he wasn t the primary receiver for a pass the only thing surprising about his latest workethic recession has been the reaction the criticism has been shrill , and his supporters have protested too much that s a lot of undue attention , and no one craves attention like terrell owens , now consigned to a part of the world that merits national headlines only when the snowfall measures in the decameters \( sunday s forecast calls for flurries \) owens may bring a pillow onto the field and sleep through a series , just to steal a few

eagles lead the nfl with 18 passing plays of 40 or more yards , as many as the 49ers , raiders , browns , bengals and rams combined only three of those passes came against the giants , though it feels

inaugural festivities extended into prime time with the neighborhood ball on abc beginning at 8 pm et abc is the exclusive broadcaster of the ball , although other networks were allowed to take live shots of president obama s remarks at the event and then only a measure or two of the first couple dancing to beyonce s version of at last abc news will follow up on the ball with a onehour special report at 10 pm nbc will show a special report at the same time cbs s prime time broadcast , change and challenge the inauguration of barack obama , was to air during the 9 pm hour continuous coverage of the inauguration will extend into the early morning hours on cable news just when you think you ve seen every possible angle on the inauguration , here s a view from space cnn showed a satellite image of the national mall on television tuesday afternoon , about six hours after the image was taken it may be the most singular view of the day , aside from the one barack obama saw as he stood at the lectern and delivered his inaugural address the halfmeter resolution image , which is now featured on geoeyecom , was taken by geoeye and shows a sprawling mass of people on the mall it was taken at 11 19 am , half an hour before the inaugural program officially started at that time , hundreds of thousands of people were already standing and seating in place , creating an opportune time for a snapshot from space david bohrman , the washington bureau chief for cnn , said the imaging satellite has been in space for about two months the cable news network commissioned the highaltitude photo shoot about one month ago it was one of those nobrainer ideas , mr bohrman said of course i d love to use this for the inauguration the satellite image shows swarms of people gathered around the massive monitors on the mall it can be viewed online here many media organizations , including the new york times , are asking for photos from people in washington cnn introduced a new technology , called photosynth , on tuesday afternoon to virtually explore the viewer images in three dimensions msnbccom also created a photosynth of the occasion the technology takes photos , matches them with others using advanced software , and assembles them to create a 3d portrait of the scene the moment , as cnn called it , was virtually navigated during the 2 pm hour the inauguration was an emotional moment for many , including some of the commentators on the fox news channel juan williams , a fox news contributor and the author of a biography of thurgood marshall and a history of the civil rights movement , came to verge of tears as he noted how the rev joseph lowery , who gave the benediction to the swearingin ceremony , was himself a remarkable presence on the stage he is the real deal , mr williams said there are other people who might say that they were there with dr king , and suffered the indignities , but joe lowery really did he continued there are some times in your life that you just think , what a country how can that be \? i never thought that would happen but there it was , and i just thank god that joe lowery was able , in that moment , to talk about the power of the silent tears edward wyatt for those who remain really upset about barack obama s election , here is a new argument contesting his legitimacy , courtesy of fox news channel noting that chief justice john roberts flubbed his recitation of the oath of office during the swearingin ceremony , chris wallace , the fox news anchor , said i m not sure that barack obama really is the president of the united states because the oath of office is set in the constitution , and i wasn t at all convinced that even after he tried to amend it that john roberts ever got it out straight and that barack obama ever said the prescribed words i suspect that everybody is going to forgive him and allow him to take over as president but i m not sure he actually said what is in the constitution brit hume , the fox news senior political analyst , came to mr obama s defense if it ever got to the supreme court , you have to know there would be at least one vote in favor of letting it stand , mr hume said specifically , the vote of chief justice roberts edward wyatt rush limbaugh said later in his radio program that in previous speeches , in grant park in chicago on election night and at the democratic national convention in denver , mr obama left the crowds spent , sweaty , orgasmic there was none of that today bill carter on fox news , president obama garnered rave reviews for his marvelously eloquent delivery of the inaugural address on its content , however , opinion was less enthusiastic michael gerson , a former speechwriter for george w bush , said the surprising thing about this speech , however , was that in this extraordinary moment , the speech was actually quite ordinary from a literary perspective there were too many raging storms and gathering clouds and other things that any writer could consider clich and i don t understand given obama s literary ear in so many past speeches how some of these things got through into an inaugural address i think it s a mystery chris wallace , the fox news anchor , agreed i have to say i do agree with you , he said i kept looking for the line that i thought was going to be engraved in granite , and other than the price and the promise of citizenship , and i m not sure how immortal that line is , i found precious little in here that i thought you know , there was not an ask not moment or the only thing we have to fear is fear itself' edward wyatt rush limbaugh wasted no time in describing how unimpressed he was with president obama s speech , which he called an acceptance speech instead of an inaugural address mr limbaugh said it fell flat and played more like a campaign speech , which he said not surprise him because he expects the obama administration to continue the campaign , the way he said the clinton administration did he excluded the bush administration from that comparison , though it was frequently criticized in other places for staying permanently in campaign mode the event was overhyped , he said , and added that he saw more energy at a mccain campaign rally and 10 times the energy at a sarah palin rally he also said the speech only drew reactions from comments about race and that it contained elements of socialism mr limbaugh said he did not like the classical music , which he said contributed to the mood becoming a downer more that anything else mr limbaugh expressed his disgust at the benediction from the rev joseph lowery because his closing remarks included the line and white will embrace what is right mr limbaugh , who has himself been accused of making racially charged comments in the past , said , of course i am offended by those remarks and told his audience to remember an empty barrel makes the most noise he said that whites were the only group to be criticized , even though it was white americans who had elected mr obama bill carter fox news found some good news for conservatives in president obama s inaugural address brit hume , the senior political analyst and former fox news anchor , said that during his election campaign , barack obama really offered almost nothing to conservatives in terms of the things the things he emphasized , the programs he promised and so on but i think that conservatives will take heart from some particularly important moments in this speech for instance , speaking about the greatness of our nation , he spoke of the role of risk takers , the doers the makers of things mr hume went on to comment that mr obama s remarks were a recognition , it seems to me , of the importance of freedom in the private sector , of the important role of citizens and individuals in creating wealth there s nothing said here about the role of government edward wyatt if bet s correspondents are trying to be impartial , bet itself doesn t seem to be at a commercial break , a house ad showing mary j blige , louis gossett jr and ll cool j praising mr obama airs , followed by bet s congratulations for mr obama hey , hey , hey , goodbye , sang members of the crowd outside msnbc s set on the mall as the helicopter carrying george w bush flew away from the capitol in the msnbc control room , the producers asked the camera operators to zoom in on the capitol in case the helicopter hovered over the mall sure enough , it flew directly over , creating another madefortv moment on a day full of them and to all , goodnight , keith olbermann said as mr bush departed phil griffin s strategy today is to let the pictures tell the story mr griffin , the president of msnbc , said that he wants the anchors to have the smartest conversation without dominating the event the pictures have driven the story today , mr griffin said at various times , the anchors have commented on the staging of the bush obama meeting at the white house , the image of dick cheney in a wheelchair , and the facial expressions of the participants at the swearingin mr griffin said he was receiving emails from starbucks stores where msnbc was being simulcast on television monitors the network arranged for meetups at over 600 starbucks in new york , seattle and san francisco after the benediction , bet host jeff johnson turned to the camera as a journalist , i m at one of those torn moments , he said , comparing it to election night then , bet s coverage was balanced and it was fair , the moment we knew that he won , it was difficult to be a journalist , it was time to be an africanamerican man it seems a to be a question bet will have to tackle all day it has planned allday inauguration coverage , and a celebration beginning tonight i am overwhelmed at this moment , and i don t know how anybody in this nation that clearly understands the history in the country can not be , mr johnson said the national anthem coming up today means something different than it meant just a few hours ago it ll be the most momentous single moment of my lifetime up until now , said hill harper , a bet correspondent and supporter of obama s , who is coanchoring the network s programming in its early coverage , bet is abandoning journalistic balance for fullon enthusiasm you can t feel the cold because you re warm , your soul is so warm , mr harper said this is our moment in so many ways on the fox news channel , along with a discussion of the unusually peaceful nature of the american transition of power , there was fulsome praise of how easy the bush administration made the process for the incoming obama team unlike , of course , the chicanery that was so characteristic of the clintons it has probably never been done better , said mort kondracke , a fox news contributor noting that the eisenhower administration was especially cooperative with the incoming kennedy team , this surpasses even that , mr kondracke said there are none of these stories about missing w s on computers the way allegedly happened at the time of the transition between bill clinton and george w bush after the unpleasantness of the 2000 election , he said this has been a model transition and the obama people are quite generous about praising president bush for it those stories about missing w s on computers in the old executive office building came to light only after the bushes had moved in , along with tales of far more serious vandalism , including missing chin on air force one but evidence of those pranks was never provided by the bush administration , and the specific stories about air force one were specifically denied by an air force spokesman as expected , this day is setting new records for live video streaming on the internet cnncom , one of the leading news web sites , says that it has served eight million live streams through 11 10 am , shattering the 24hour record of 53 million streams on election day msnbc s prime time hosts haven t been shy about their feelings for barack obama this is the channel , after all , that has used the tagline the power of change for the past two months chris matthews brought up the preferences of the prime time hosts during the 11 am hour this is a network that has opened its heart to change , mr matthews said , calling the channel one for the 21st century he s writing a promo out there , a staffer in the control room laughed the network , a unit of nbc universal , endured some criticism last year for its perceived liberal leanings in prime time the network chose to have david gregory , a news correspondent , anchor the coverage on election night mr matthews and keith olbermann are back as anchors today the network has defended it by saying that today s event is ceremonial in nature if today is a super bowl of news , keith olbermann and chris matthews are two of the color commentators in the press box sitting in a studio on the mall , blocks from the capitol , mr olbermann and mr matthews sometimes turn around , place their backs to the camera and watch a sea of supporters wave american flags in the distance at one point , mr matthews asked the camera operators to zoom in on the faces in the crowd they are radiant , he said a couple hundred people have surrounded msnbc s studio near 7th street on the mall the outdoor noise reverberates through the studio , adding to the football stadium feel we re in the cheap seats by the hot dog stand , mr olbermann said outside the set , an ice sculpture of mr obama s image is sitting on the ground it s been there since sunday , demonstrating just how cold it is here for all the television channels , there s a tension between showing and telling the scenes in washington at what point should the commentators stop talking and let the images speak for themselves \? the priority is covering the essence of the moment , said jonathan klein , the president of cnn us , at a party sponsored by the huffington post monday night it s not so much words or pictures as it is a general feel when barack obama gave his victory speech in grant park on nov 4 , the cnn hosts fell silent for several minutes mr klein said he expects some similar moments at the swearingin today , more than most days , the images will speak for themselves
west point , ny as presidential decisions go , there is none as grave as the choice to commit young men and women to war and as presidential settings go , there is none as somber as the oval office yet when president obama addresses the nation tuesday night to explain the most consequential choice of his young presidency the decision to send an additional 34 , 000 troops to afghanistan he will do so from the united states military academy s picturesque campus of stone and brick buildings overlooking the hudson river here the venue offers insight into the messages mr obama hopes to convey , and how he plans to fit his new afghanistan strategy into the broader themes of his administration simply by giving the speech , mr obama will become more closely aligned with afghanistan a war he did not begin and one he says he wants to end had the president given tuesday night s speech from the oval office the inner sanctum of the white house he would have brought the war into the very core of his presidency , elevating it above other matters , like health care and the economy , which are also deeply important to him white house officials say there were specific reasons for choosing west point , the army s training ground first off , the army has borne an extremely heavy burden in this war , and the president wanted to speak to them directly , tommy vietor , a spokesman for mr obama , said additionally , west point is an institution where cadets train , but also where they study how to tackle longterm security challenges these challenges are the same ones that were raised and discussed throughout the president s review critics , though , accuse mr obama of using the military as a prop richard v allen , ronald reagan s national security adviser , wrote in an email message that mr obama s decision to deliver the speech before an audience of cadets basically trivializes the decision by infusing it with theatrics , an argument he also made in an online column in the politico an announcement on which so much rests must be made from the president s own unique and highly symbolic center of authority , the oval office , mr allen wrote it has meaning it should be made by him alone , without the props of thousands in an audience and the hoopla of presidential travel and a massive press entourage ten months into his presidency , mr obama has yet to deliver a major speech from the oval office mr vietor would not say if it was under consideration for this one advisers did consider the oval office for mr obama s nationally televised speech on health care in september , but settled on an address before a joint session of congress instead oval office speeches tend to be short , and the congressional setting allowed for a longer format in which mr obama could make a detailed argument that may be one reason mr obama is not using the oval office tuesday night his remarks are expected to run 35 to 40 minutes practical considerations are also at work presidents tend to feel more comfortable talking to a live audience a military audience also drives home the message that mr obama is sensitive to the consequences of his decision , and how it will affect troops and their families the choice of a live audience gives the president an emotional connection to his words that is missing from an oval office speech , said doris kearns goodwin , the presidential historian franklin delano roosevelt liked fireside chats for important speeches , she said , because he believed a conversational tone pitched as if he were talking to families seated beside their fireplaces was the best way of making an emotional connection mr obama will deliver his speech from eisenhower hall , a large recreational facility on the west point campus that has a cafe and an auditorium it often plays host to musical performances in the lobby signs are on display for the singer kenny rogers , who is coming to perform a christmas show but tuesday , the stage was set for mr obama , who will speak against a backdrop of flags of the united states , and the armed forces , against a curtain in a standard shade of presidential blue presidents tend to reserve the oval office for their most serious addresses , yet have chosen various setting for their wartime speeches woodrow wilson appeared before congress to seek a declaration of war on germany john f kennedy addressed the nation from the oval office to talk about the cuban missile crisis when former president george w bush announced in january 2007 that , after months of bloodshed in iraq , he was increasing the american troop presence there , he spoke to the nation from the white house library advisers were casting about for a setting inside the white house that was different , said brett mcgurk , who advised mr bush on afghanistan and iraq , and also served briefly in the obama administration but nine months later , mr bush had better news to deliver , as he announced a troop reduction in iraq he did so from the oval office
on both its news and opinion programming monday , the fox news channel responded to the white house s portrayal of the network as a part of the political opposition the commentator glenn beck was the most judgmental , claiming at the beginning of his opinion show that they re more worried about the war on fox than the actual war in afghanistan mr beck then whipped out a map of manhattan and circled fox s headquarters , sarcastically calling fox the enemy as he surrounded the spot on the map with toy tanks and barbed wire later , he suggested that the white house was using your tax dollars to target the media mr beck was reacting to anita dunn , the white house communications director , who told the new york times on sunday that the obama administration was treating fox news the way we would treat an opponent fox always swings back at critics mediaite says it is a strategy that is an extension of their current policy , as they play up the feud just as much as the white house is ms dunn has said that administration officials would still talk to fox and that mr obama was likely to be interviewed on the network in the future but fox reported monday that the channel has been told by the white house not to expect an interview with the president this year referring to ms dunn , the fox news correspondent james rosen reported , one of her own aides formally notified fox news that none of the news programs that had requested interviews with the president , including america s newsroom with bill hemmer and megyn kelly , special report with bret baier , or fox news sunday with chris wallace would receive one any time this year mr rosen s nearly fiveminutelong report was shown on an afternoon newscast on monday

i was trapped sheepishly , i chuckled and offered , uh , killzone 2 \? her reaction did not surprise me killzone 2 \? she said with a laugh you 're always talking about how video games are reaching out to a broader audience and women and stuff , and you 're playing a game called killzone 2 \? that s hilarious i 'd like to think i took my lumps with some measure of aplomb , as i'm sure killzone 2 s developers at guerrilla games in amsterdam do when they tell people in that city s chic lounges and warm cafes what they have been working on for the last five years or so with a title like killzone 2 you have to expect some head shaking from the public but of course there is an elegance as well , a bit like naming your game after a major crime category \( comes to mind , though i'm still waiting for a game called , quite plainly , murder \) at the most basic level a title like killzone 2 gives you a pretty good idea of what to expect lots of big guns , lots of explosions , lots of testosterone and lots of bodies but such an overthetop title does not necessarily convey how delicately killzone 2 has been put together , how carefully designed and exquisitely paced all of those little bits of shrapnel and cordite and concrete and blood have been a firefight in killzone 2 can be frantic and confusing and terrifying , but it can also be simultaneously balletic in its deadly tactical logic of suppression fire and cover , flanking and breach simply from a presentation standpoint killzone 2 s futuristic urban warrens , dusty mining camps , underground refineries and lambent cloudscapes make it the finestlooking shooter i have seen on a console gears of war 2 , the top shooter for microsoft s competing xbox 360 , still looks good , but with killzone 2 , sony is demonstrating that the superior silicon horsepower in the playstation 3 is opening a widening gap over the 360 when it comes to pure eye candy but graphics alone do not explain why killzone 2 is the best new game of this young year , and the first legitimate 2009 game of the year candidate each level , each weapon and the artificial intelligence have been designed to reward varied tactics and intelligent planning in addition to good aim this is no run and gun shooter , where you blast away with impunity killzone 2 is a thinking game in an approximation of the way that actual ground combat is a thinking game the first time you make your way through waves of enemy soldiers and take a major objective like salamun bridge , you will have earned it thanks to your mind as much as your trigger finger perhaps the highest praise i can offer is that killzone 2 is the first console shooter to make an oldschool pc gamer like me wish it was available for my system when it comes to firstperson shooters , perhaps the most overpopulated form in all of video games , i have always been , and remain , a pc chauvinist shooters were invented on and for personal computers , not special consoles that plug into a television despite the popularity of console series like and gears of war , i still find a pc s mouse and keyboard far more precise than consoles' dualthumbstick controllers and despite major advances in console hardware , topend pc graphics remain the gold standard for visual fidelity and impact \( the tradeoff is that a top gaming pc can cost as much as a used car \) so i have to admit that whenever i play a shooter that is available only on a console , i 've always felt like i'm compromising until now i still wish there was a pc version , so i could use a mouse and keyboard \( it 'll never happen \) , but killzone 2 is the first console shooter that does not seem to give up much in the design and production department to the best pc shooters the game also includes an excellent online multiplayer component killzone 2 is so good at what it does provide an airtight , throatgrabbing entertainment combat experience that i found myself hardly even caring about what it does not do well the story behind the game is meaningless , even irrelevant in the roughly 10hour singleplayer campaign , you are off to defeat a cabal of darth vaderinspired space nazis called the helghast all you really need to know is that if it has red eyes , shoot it the screenplay is a joke and the voice acting is barely a rung above serviceable , if that but none of that really matters as an essential , visceral sciencefiction combat fantasy , killzone 2 is one of the most enjoyable console shooters yet do n't mind if anyone laughs at the name
pittsburgh one great springtime phenomenon has just been brought to an end for another year , courtesy of the nhl and its arrangement with nbc the crowd of thousands of fans who gather on the lawn outside mellon arena to watch penguins playoff games on the giant tv screen here the atmosphere outside the igloo for these viewing parties is fantastic , as good as anything from the 2006 fifa world cup in germany pittsburghers , all of them in pens gear in this hockeymad city , start walking through downtown and over the bridges from the south side in the late afternoon , lugging lawns chairs and coolers you ve probably seen them on versus or fox telecasts celebrating wildly when the pens score , as last night when jordan staal tied the score for the pens before games the scene at the screen looks like this the nhl , however , forbids the showing of nbc s broadcasts on big outdoor screens , as the pittsburgh postgazette succinctly explains  so while big happy crowds on the igloo lawn watched games 3 and 4 of the cup finals which can be shown publicly because they were carried on versus , a cable channel none of the remaining games will be shown here because nbc , a broadcast network , is carrying them as that postgazette article says , broadcast networks like nbc draw revenue solely from advertising , and a big outdoor crowd would knock down the pittsburgh area s nielsen rating and thus advertising charges since nbc pays the nhl nothing for carrying its games and the nhl s only earnings from the broadcasts are a portion of the advertising profits , the league has a vested interest in keeping that rating as high as it can but the price is the loss of one of the game s most atmospheric experiences here in pittsburgh , one of hockey s most special places
for all the disappointment that torii hunter has endured at the hands of the over the years , friday night actually was the first time that he had lost game 1 of a playoff series at yankee stadium he had been there in the postseason in 2003 and 2004 , when he played for minnesota , but in both those years hunter s twins were victorious in game 1 , only to eventually lose the series those experiences , among others , have taught hunter the folly of divining too much significance from the opening game of a series , especially if it is a game that he and his teammates considered an aberration simply for the atrocious way they played it for hunter , it s far too early in the series to start lamenting his crushingly low success rate against the yankees in the postseason it was just one game , he kept repeating after the yankees' 41 victory in game 1 of their bestofseven american league championship series the had not even gone back to california to embrace the warm sunshine of anaheim it s disappointing , hunter said , but we know we have seven games in this series it s the first team to four , not one in other words , it s too early to be cursing the fates for his misfortune against the yankees in october , too soon to put this series into the same bin with his other failed attempts as a member of the twins but after seeing the way c c sabathia handled the angels in game 1 , and knowing there is a chance he could pitch again as soon as game 4 , one has to wonder is it simply hunter s fate to play the foil against the yankees in the postseason \? if he thinks that way , and it is unlikely he does , he was not letting on it s just one game , he said i think we 're going to come back tomorrow you 've got c c he added c c sabathia was good , man you 've got to give him credit i tip my hat to him we tried to get to him , i tried to put a bunt down , and he showed me his athletic ability , his basketball skills and everything so , c c s the real deal , man indeed , the yankees' victory was mostly about sabathia but the angels' sloppy play was alarming they committed three errors that contributed to two unearned runs a miscue on a popup cost starter john lackey another run , even though the breakdown was more of a communication gaffe and not ruled an error because neither shortstop erick aybar nor third baseman chone figgins touched the ball figgins appeared to tell aybar that he should catch the ball , but aybar just looked at figgins until the ball landed there was no lack of communication when lackey screamed something unpleasant at both infielders later , lackey made a throwing error on a pickoff attempt , which was followed by an error by hunter derek jeter laced a single to center but hunter failed to catch the ball on the bounce as he charged it melky cabrera scored on the play , and jeter reached second base it was windy , but hunter said that did not affect him no , no , he said , laughing i caught all the fly balls it was the ground balls that got me hunter said it was important for the angels to have selective amnesia they could even turn those uncharacteristic fielding blunders and some unusually passive atbats into an encouraging sign the angels are known as a fundamentally sound team , so some players tossed away the game as an anomaly honestly , it makes it easier to turn the page , lackey said we know we did n't play up to our capabilities , and we can kind of chalk it up to that none of the players , not even hunter , could point to a single reason for the shoddy performance , although several areas were worth examining was it the long layoff after they beat the boston red sox on sunday \? was it the intimidating atmosphere in yankee stadium \? was it the chilly game conditions , with 45degree temperatures and howling winds in the outfield \? hunter said he was not concerned about the weather he could not even accept the notion that a few of his teammates , some of whom were more bundled up against the conditions , might have been bothered that s not an excuse , he said i wish somebody would say that it was cold out there that s terrible man , you ca n't go out there and say it s cold , that s why we lost we got whupped the angels certainly got whupped by sabathia , and that should be their greatest concern the errors might go away but sabathia will be back , sooner than the angels care to see
everything about the choreographer shen wei s story says east meets west he was born in china , was a founding member of that country s first moderndance company in 1991 , moved to new york in 1995 , became an american citizen in 2006 and contributed choreography to the opening ceremony of the 2008 beijing olympics now he has brought his company , shen wei dance arts , to the in a trilogy of works all called re the prefix re invokes , a program note advises us , themes of return , reconsideration and renewal re \( part i \) is , we 're informed , about aspects of tibet re \( part ii \) about angkor wat in cambodia re \( part iii \) about modern beijing mr shen has some degree of choreographic sophistication each part of the trilogy is plainly in a separate style , within which he can often get three or more different dances going at the same time each part of re at alice tully hall is accompanied by sound and music \( some of it live \) that belongs to , or evokes , the appropriate part of asia and each one creates its own theatrical image mr shen has designed the sets and costumes , jennifer tipton the lighting mr shen does n't play his three parts in numerical order , mind you part iii comes second , ii last \( to add a dash more confusion to the mix , his program notes order them parts iii , i and ii , though this looks like a typographical error \) the common denominators of mr shen s style ask his dancers to make currents that pass up and down their bodies , sometimes with ricochets and crosscurrents the performers turn their legs in and out , here extending them in straight lines , there angling them at knee and ankle though the movement is heavyfooted \( no real use of the instep at all \) , it is sometimes capable of serious pedestrian speed , breaking now and then into runs or rushes usually , however , the dancers cover space slowly , if at all all of them use their weight to full effect , and part ii shows us individuals sinking to the floor and holding strongly sculptural poses for many minutes on end mr shen seems to enjoy group choreography his various tableaus and formations keep changing direction or structure meanwhile , we see loners sundered from the group and couples who seem to struggle vainly within it sometimes we 're pointedly shown 6 couples or 12 \( or 13 \) soloists , each in different poses or phrases so far , so good but mr shen does n't choreograph like a seriously expressive artist instead he seems to be asking us to respond like ba students in a danceanalysis course discuss the relations of individual and ensemble in re' discuss its use of weight and flow , stillness and movement , tension and relaxation discuss its sociopolitical evocation of three different asian cultures discuss its application of western moderndance styles you can watch re and score all kinds of points by checking its various dance and cultural boxes , but you ca n't keep your mind on it as a work of art re is a bore none of its ideas sustain their limited interest nothing about it feels truly fresh part i , tibet , begins with a symmetrical multicolored mandala floor pattern made out of shreds of paper , and the main point of the choreography is gradually to erode that pattern , with the dancers taking one path after another across the stage until the colored paper is equally mixed , as in a stew \( the idea of performers heedlessly destroying a floor environment is thoroughly pina bausch \) in between , dancers sit or balance in poses that suggest meditation others travel in wavelike phrases that roll , peak , fall and disperse mr shen knows how to break the monotony of each section by giving us a structural change now and then , but each new device soon establishes a monotony of its own part iii , beijing , goes in for a more intense use of physical coordination , which in one episode \( set to pizzicati in david lang s score \) becomes spasmodic halfway through , most of the dancers return in new costumes to the stage , looking now like the world s worstdressed sports team \( long dark socks , short shorts , gruesomely mottled sweaters \) and starting in a scrum other sports imagery develops , none of it interesting even when we 're shown 13 simultaneous different solos , they 're tedious a smart exercise idea that catches no dance life part ii , cambodia , after briefly giving a few soloists some moments that prove more incisive than we are shown anywhere else , presents us the evening s sole arresting device halfway through , the dancers return to the stage barechested , joined now by some more middleaged performers we have not previously seen the first of them poses on the floor , propping herself on one elbow , her head thrown back , her breasts exposed , her other elbow held aloft it s virtually the look of a flamboyant sunbather , and yet ms tipton s lighting \( bright , from overhead \) turns her into a piece of alabasterwhite sculpture and the same happens to the next dancer to strike the same pose the contrast of these snowwhite models and the more softly sidelighted skin tones of other dancers moving elsewhere around the stage is , at first , brilliant then we just go on watching the poses multiply they eventually become especially as the senior cast members increase in number a shtick , manipulative and sensationalistic this tripartite show lasts , with two intermissions , two hours and 10 minutes mr shen is n't lacking in polish or variety , and he certainly has ideas but each dance stagnates before your eyes beneath the structural accomplishment and crosscultural concepts , a certain blandness is in evidence throughout
setting the colonnadeandmarble district of the nation s capital characters an idealistic young politician and his goodlooking friends plot together they try to change america such a plotline is playing out on cable news channels each day , but it is missing from the next season of network television no fewer than five shows with washington backdrops were well under way at hollywood studios this season , but none were ordered as series when the networks set their schedules last month , prompting befuddlement on the part of some producers the west wing they were not , perhaps , but the shows tried to capitalize on the highest voter turnout in a generation and renewed enthusiasm about public service if any year would spawn the next great political drama , some of the producers say , should n't this have been it \? there is such a desire for this subject matter , especially at this time , said peter horton , an executive producer of body politic , a pilot about a congressional aide that the cw network turned down the fact that there were five of these pilots this year , and none of them got on the air , it s a real missed opportunity for now , the only new shows with district of columbia addresses are reality shows last week bravo announced the real housewives of dc , and next month cw will introduce blonde charity mafia , a show about 20something socialites in the city television executives are generally reluctant to talk about the shows they decide not to order but programmers and media analysts say there are many reasons that the networks preferred more scifi adventures and medical thrillers over political dramas they may not think viewers want washingtonbased shows , and may choose programs with stronger overseas appeal or , more plainly and more likely , the test episodes \( commonly called pilots \) may not have been any good indeed , test audiences were reportedly not impressed by several of the pilots cbs ordered pilots for house rules , about a freshman class of legislators on capitol hill , and a pilot for washington field , about an fbi unit called the national capital response squad abc had see cate run , about a young lawyer with a presidential bid in her future , and inside the box , about the staff at a network news bureau in the capital house rules is still being considered for a midseason order , according to cbs the body politic producers are trying to drum up interest from other networks by ordering so many pilots , the networks seemed to be nodding to the surge in civic spirit that accompanied president obama s election in sizing up some of the pilots in march , the washington post suggested that the nation s capital was smallscreen smokin' these days body politic , for instance , originated as a show for abc about three years ago at that time it was a more cynical look at the corridors of power , and abc passed on the project mr horton said cw approached him a few days after mr obama s and asked him to rework the drama to reflect the times in the new script the characters were more hopeful about making a difference but cw had only a few holes in its schedule , and it favored a melrose place remake and shows about vampires and modeling instead the producers of the political pilots must have been aware , even in a pivotal political season , that the west wing is the exception , as washington shows go that critically acclaimed drama , starring martin sheen as a democratic president , was shown on nbc from 1999 to 2006 others set in the capital like commander in chief on abc , the capitol hill show mister sterling on nbc and the supreme court drama first monday on cbs never made it to a second season maybe the collective concern is that they 'll never be able to come up with a show that will rival or surpass the sensibility of the west wing , ' said shari anne brill , a senior vice president at the media agency carat rod lurie , the creator of commander in chief , says the producers who looked at mr obama s victory and thought , now we can do dc shows , miscalculated people still hate washington , he said they just love obama mr lurie said viewers were not invested in the lives of members of congress or supreme court justices they care about the most powerful man or woman on earth , he said the political shows that were considered tried to appeal to younger viewers the cast of body politic looked ripped from the pages of a celebrity magazine , and house rules was sometimes characterized as a soap opera there is at least a little bit of evidence that people are yearning for political tv the first part of inside the obama white house , a dayinthelife documentary by nbc news , drew nine million viewers on tuesday , making nbc no 1 for the hour among 18 to 49yearolds ms brill said the projects might have been sidelined in favor of those that had more earning power in international markets , where programs sometimes recoup their production costs shows with a political backdrop often demand a big ensemble cast and may not translate well overseas , she said she added that other problems , like poor storytelling , can impair a show no matter where it takes place abc said that inside the box , from the creator of grey s anatomy , shonda rhimes , had some issues and would need reworking reiterating the importance of storytelling , mark gordon , an executive producer of house rules , said that for shows set in dc , enthusiasm about government is just a plus his series , he said , would live or die based on the characters
only as strong as the weakest links , and i don t think there s a weak one here enjoy a canadian football league player decided to honor michael jackson by playing dead during a touchdown celebration \( the worst td celebration in cfl history \? there may be one worse see at bottom \) shutdown corner with the winning take there are literally dozens of ways a football player could pay homage to michael jackson after scoring a touchdown he could moonwalk or kick his leg out and yell shamon ! or grab his crotch or take off a glove or dance with macaulay culkin heck , a player could even wheel out a hyperbaric chamber and go to sleep inside , all while bubbles the chimpanzee plays drums with the elephant man s bones apparently none of these ideas were good enough for cfl player arland bruce lisa olson , fanhouse , on the divisions within the district attorney s office in the plaxico burress case sycophants have plaxico burress back , no matter where he turns that some of these wannabe teammates draw paychecks from the manhattan district attorney s office is hardly surprising sean keeler , the des moines register , on the strength of the sons of ed parker , the iowa high school coach who was killed by one of his plalyers guests have been coming and going for days , a trail of tears that intersects at the corner of johnson and conn streets i think when people come to our house right now , they leave feeling stronger after visiting , aaron says i know they re coming here to help they all knew my dad personally well and i think when they see how well my mom is doing , they take strength from that was the hall of famer jim brown too harsh in his criticism of tiger woods \? john aloysius farrell , contributing editor at us news world report he does his part every time he stands on the tee , or sinks a winning putt , the cool and classy king of a sport that , for too many years , was played at segregated country clubs , where the only dark skins were in the kitchens and the caddy yards just by being tiger , he fights , and wins but , truthfully , i confess i was disappointed when tiger took the safe way out during last year s presidential election charles robinson , yahoo sports , on how nfl players are leading the way on twitter if some analysts are right , ochocinco s popularity only scratches the surface of where twitter could be taking the nfl once the regular season starts
watching the industrious chris duhon of slidell , la , chase the gifted chris paul of winstonsalem , nc , during a rare knicks victory in new orleans brought to mind something i had occasionally been wondering about the last few weeks where have all the new york city point guards gone \? to a certain extent , s continued absence almost selfimposed , at this point , by his nihilistic refusal to negotiate a buyout from his hometown team raises and answers the question on ability , marbury should have been his generation s new york city standardbearer , wherever he played , instead of the poster point guard for dysfunction and waste not to everyone , mind you , including one former knick and native new yorker whose playing reputation was antithetical to marbury s second in career assists in the nba to john stockton , mark jackson is widely considered to have exceeded his quoteunquote natural talent because point guards are usually judged on whether they play for winning teams , that s what a lot of people think about stephon , but it s probably not all fair , jackson said from los angeles , his adopted home you look at his numbers , and they are awfully impressive , career wise attitude and likeability aside , it is an assertion that cannot be summarily dismissed , factoring marbury s 197 career scoring average and his 6 , 396 assists he is 22nd on the career assists list despite playing only 24 games last season and none this season if marbury , who will turn 32 next month , never suits up again , he will still outrank other new york city point guard legends whose professional careers ranged from fair \( kenny anderson \) to poor \( pearl washington \) to virtually nonexistent \( kareem reid , omar cook , erick barkley \) with marbury s coney island cousin sebastian telfair well on his way to career backuphood and another behaviorally challenged brooklynite , jamaal tinsley , banished from the indiana pacers , who could blame the rest of the country for dismissing new york s reputation as a spawning ground of great point guards as a news media myth \? did you ever believe in god shammgod \? out of lasalle academy in manhattan , he was on the same mcdonald s allamerican team as marbury and starred at providence college before lasting one season in the nba so it goes for the modern new york city point guard , best represented these days by rafer alston of the rockets mind you , five of the career assists leaders are from new york jackson \( 2 \) , rod strickland \( 8 \) , lenny wilkens \( 10 \) , bob cousy \( 14 \) and tiny archibald \( 19 \) but that was then none of the current premier nba point guards are from new york , including the group that promises to dominate the position for years to come besides paul , derrick rose of the bulls is from chicago , deron williams of the jazz was born in west virginia and attended high school in texas , the nets' devin harris is from milwaukee and the spurs' tony parker is from france add the established veteran stars jason kidd \( oakland , calif \) , chauncey billups \( denver \) , steve nash \( canada \) and baron davis \( los angeles \) , and the point about new york s production decline is impossible to dispute it s not easy being a great high school player in new york , washington said last winter at the public schools athletic league title game at madison square garden the hype kind of follows you forever tom konchalski , the queensbased rebbe of scholastic recruiting via his high school basketball insider newsletter , agreed with washington , saying sebastian has n't lived up marbury has n't lived up he suggested that the more public pampering of new york city scholastic players regardless of position may be a factor but street hustlers and espn cameras fawn on all high school superstars , so is it the developmental environment , or more a run of overhyped or underachieving new york apples \? i do n't really have an explanation for it , said jackson , who coincidentally believes the state of the point guard position is at an alltime low , with few who truly fit the job description and more who think shoot first and pass second that might have been the case for a spell , but it seems that paul , rose and williams are more in the kiddnash mold than not , and that the knicks would beg to make any of them the resident garden point guard and an honorary new yorker
the pentagon s recent decision not to award the purple heart to soldiers suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder strikes us as reasonable and well considered this is not to say that the result was uncomplicated or unlikely to cause understandable sadness and pain the military has always honored the sacrifice of veterans who are wounded in its wars but it has been slow to recognize that those wounds can include invisible injuries the nightmares , rages and terrors of ptsd , which are as real as any scar or missing limb ptsd can be difficult to diagnose , with symptoms that can arise later in life , far from the battlefield and are not necessarily linked to any specific actions of an enemy so the pentagon contends that it has no choice but to exclude its sufferers from the purple heart , given to those whose injuries result from direct and intentional action by the enemy doing so would not debase the medal , as some defenders of the purple heart callously put it , but it would change it , perhaps in unintended and unwelcome ways the main criterion for awarding the purple heart has always been bloodshed those looking for absolute fairness in this distinction will never find it a soldier who cowers or blunders into harm s way will receive his medal just as surely as his quickthinking , unscathed buddy will not a soldier whose lacerations heal completely will wear the same medal as someone who has lost a limb or been paralyzed for life none of this relieves the military of its duty to fully honor those whose injuries are unseen a purple heart may not be the answer not until , perhaps , advances in brain science bring full objectivity to the diagnosis of mental injury but ptsd sufferers surely deserve medical care every bit as diligent and excellent as what their fellow veterans receive for more visible injuries the pentagon has been prodded to do so by the deadly innovation of the current war the bomb blasts that have exacted such a deadly toll in brain injuries the military is , in fact , moving forward merely by mentioning ptsd and the purple heart in the same breath imagine gen george patton , who so notoriously slapped a quivering enlisted man , learning that his beloved army was even considering giving medals to those whose combat tours left them mentally shattered but there is far more to do recent veterans of iraq or afghanistan will tell you that the military stigma against mental illness has not abated , that the combat ethos suck it up , soldier persists and that some officers continue to belittle the severity , and even question the existence , of posttraumatic stress at least 300 , 000 service members who were in afghanistan or iraq show symptoms of ptsd they know a truth their forebears of vietnam , korea and world war ii have lived with for years war injures everyone it touches
jerusalem international aid groups lashed out at on thursday over the war in , saying that access to civilians in need is poor , relief workers are being hurt and killed , and israel is woefully neglecting its obligations to who are trapped , some among rotting corpses in a nightmarish landscape of deprivation the declared a suspension of its aid operations after one of its drivers was killed and two others were wounded despite driving united nationsflagged vehicles and coordinating their movements with the israeli military the united nations secretary general , ban kimoon , called for an investigation by israel for a second time in a week after the more than 40 deaths near a united nations school from israeli tank fire on tuesday the international committee of the red cross reported finding what it called shocking scenes on wednesday , including four emaciated children next to the bodies of their dead mothers in a rare and sharply critical statement , it said it believed that the israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded israeli officials said that they were examining all the allegations , that they did not aim at civilians and that they were not certain that the source of fire that killed and wounded the united nations drivers was israeli we do our utmost to avoid hitting civilians , and many times we do n't fire because we see civilians nearby , said maj avital leibovich , chief army spokeswoman for the foreign media we are holding meetings with un officials to try to work out a mechanism so that their work can go forward she said that the army learned of the red cross allegations in a media report , and that the genevabased committee had not yet presented the evidence of what she called these very serious allegations to the army at the united nations , members of the security council voted thursday night to approve a resolution calling for an immediate , durable and fully respected ceasefire that would lead to the full withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza , the passage of humanitarian aid to the palestinians and an end to the trafficking of arms and ammunition into the territory fourteen nations approved the measure , with the united states abstaining secretary of state condoleezza rice said the united states abstained from voting on the resolution , which left it unclear how a ceasefire would be enforced , because it wanted to see whether mediation efforts undertaken by president hosni mubarak of succeed the united states did not veto the resolution because washington supports its overall goals , she said some arab ambassadors expressed disappointment that the measure did not specifically call for a lifting of the israeli blockade of gaza , and some western ambassadors acknowledged a long history of united nations resolutions that led nowhere we are all very conscious that peace is made on the ground , while resolutions are written in the united nations , said david miliband , the british foreign secretary a red cross spokeswoman , annesophie bonefeld , said that when the children and others were rescued in gaza on wednesday , workers had to leave behind a number of bodies on thursday , she said , 100 civilians were rescued from the same gaza city neighborhood they were not wounded , but they were weakened because of being without food or water for two days as the war entered its 14th day , and israeli airstrike destroyed a fivestory building , killing at least seven people , security officials told the associated press the gaza authorities said that the death toll passed 750 , with women and children making up about 40 percent of the dead israel held its fire for three hours thursday afternoon , the second day in a row , to allow in aid it was during that pause that local ambulance crews and the red crescent found dozens of bodies under a collapsed building three israeli soldiers were killed in combat seven other soldiers have died during the military campaign , which is aimed at stopping hamas rocket fire , and three civilians have been killed by rockets more rockets flew into israel and , for the first time since the operation against hamas began , three katyusha rockets were shot from into northern israel , which fought a war with israel in 2006 that included thousands of rockets , said it was not responsible but attention was increasingly focused on the growing humanitarian crisis and on the increasing anger abroad israel condemned a highranking vatican official for comparing gaza to a concentration camp look at the conditions in gaza more and more , it resembles a big concentration camp , cardinal renato martino , the head of the pontifical council for justice and peace , said in an interview published wednesday in il sussidiaro he defended his comments in the centerleft italian daily la repubblica on thursday while noting that hamas rockets into israel were certainly not sugared almonds , he called the situation in gaza horrific israel sharply condemned the cardinal s use of world war ii imagery we are astounded that a spiritual dignitary would have such words that are so far removed from truth and dignity , said yigal palmor , a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry the vatican sought to play down the remarks , calling them inopportune john holmes , a united nations emergency relief coordinator , said in new york that the threehour daily pause in the fighting permitted by israel in gaza was insufficient he said the gaza authorities counted 758 fatalities , among them 257 children and 56 women the injured totaled 3 , 100 of them 1 , 080 were children and about were 465 women he added that the gaza authorities reported that 20 , 000 were displaced but that conditions prevented officials from helping them properly the continuing violence is making humanitarian aid increasingly difficult and almost impossible , mr holmes said antoine grand , head of red cross operations in gaza , said his group s workers came under israeli fire on thursday he said a convoy of two trucks , one clearly marked as red cross and the other from the ministry of health , was taking medical equipment to the southern city of khan yunis , followed by 13 ambulances heading to the egyptian border he said the convoy s movement was fully coordinated with israel i did it myself and it was during the threehour lull , at 3 30 pm , he said , when they stopped in front of the checkpoint that the red cross vehicle was shot at from a tank one bullet passed 10 centimeters from the head of the driver , he said he was lightly injured from shattered glass mr grand said the group would limit its operations to gaza city israeli officials said they were investigating the jerusalem post s web site quoted an israeli medical worker as saying that the killing of the united nations driver that contributed to the suspension of aid delivery was the work of a hamas sniper john ging , who heads united nations relief operations in gaza , said by telephone that he was unaware of any information suggesting that the driver had been shot by hamas if they have evidence , let them present it , he said , adding that in none of the events of the past few days the attacks on the school or the trucks was there any evidence of crossfire he visited the school after the shelling i want an exhaustive investigation to establish all the facts , he said in a telephone interview in the school , they say two of those killed were militants but that means 41 were civilians that is wholly and totally a very serious matter regarding duty of care and appropriate use of force but i ca n't pass judgment without the facts
senator russ feingold held his promised hearing on the constitutionality of socalled czars in the obama administration on tuesday afternoon , winnowing away at a list of criticized appointees in his effort to examine whether the senate s adviseandconsent role was being circumvented by the executive branch next up is a hearing a week from wednesday , when the senate s homeland security committee takes up the issue , too , zeroing in a little differently on the number of socalled czars and a slightly expanded number of appointments during president obama s tenure when senator feingold , who is chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution , opened his hearing , he called it unfortunate that the white house had refused to send a representative to talk about the issue before the panel it s also a bit ironic , senator feingold noted , since one of the concerns that has been raised about these officials is that they will thwart congressional oversight of the executive branch the white house did make somewhat of an effort to respond , albeit in writing a day before the hearing , greg craig , the white house counsel , sent a threepage letter reviewing 18 positions within the administration that had been questioned , not only by senator feingold , but also by a group of six republican senators in a recent letter mr craig wrote that duties of many of the aides indeed come under the purview of congressional oversight , because they actually work within federal agencies whose employees have testified before congress and whose records are public some exercise no independent legal authority , mr craig contended , in their roles as presidential advisers none , he argued , raise valid concerns about accountability , transparency or congressional oversight his point , however , stands at the crux of the debate within these quieter senate inquiries , and his missive was dissected a bit by senators and by witnesses who appeared before the feingold panel the witnesses pointed out that presidents have had longstanding authority to appoint advisers its discussion , and the one next week , are being conducted outside the louder environs of a cablefueled , blogdriven effort especially among conservatives they are pointedly and admittedly devoted to trying to take down one socalled czar after another , following their success in forcing van jones from his rather minor position as a green jobs czar while mr craig argued in his letter that mr obama was well within his authority , and ensconced in quite a few presidents and constitutional precedents , to appoint people to these positions , he did cede one point it is true that the president has created a small number of new white house positions to assist him in addressing matters of great public concern , in critical areas such as the environment and health care it is those two positions , most notably , that have been singled out by some critics because of the very nature of their highprofile jobs for example , matt spalding , of the heritage foundation s center for american studies , testified at the hearing that questions could arise from the key role played by carol browner , the climate change environment czar , in developing the new emissions standards , following a supreme court decision on the clean air act mr spalding explained the concerns this way as the number of czars expands , the president s policy staff grows there are more and more individuals acting more and more seemingly as administrative heads rather than advisers , and congress should raise questions as to whether , and to what extent , they are protected by executive privilege there are numerous managerial problems with this , that i raise in my paper , looking back to the nixon administration , the lessons of the tower commissions , the possibility of political influence over decisionmaking and i conclude by noting that we have a dilemma between the current congress that tends to give away large amounts of authority for instance , in the tarp bill , which gave the secretary of the treasury extensive delegation of power , 700 billion to purchase troubled assets low and behold we now own general motors and we have a car czar setting aside the policy , was that congress s intention \? senator tom coburn , republican of oklahoma , wondered aloud to the witnesses before the panel how much leeway , for example , kenneth feinberg , the executive pay czar , would have to avoid appearing before congress although mr coburn was quick to say that he wasn t suggesting mr feinberg had refused to testify before congress the senator mentioned mr feinberg s latest news that he was taking aim at compensation , and would cut annual cash salaries for many of the top employees under his authority , according to reports some of the witnesses responded that congressional scrutiny of mr feinberg s actions , under the auspices of the treasury department , would certainly be within the powers of the legislative branch at the hearing , the actual terminology of czar also was bandied about , defined and redefined , from its actual meaning to its connotation one witness said the term dates back to the coolidge years as the white house has contended , no official in the administration holds an official title of czar for this or that but it has become rather colloquial usage , from the pundits to even the presidents themselves over time and in this polarized climate , the word has taken on a meaning of its own i should note that while the term czar has taken on a somewhat negative connotation in the media in the past few months , several presidents , including president obama , have used the term themselves to describe the people they have appointed , mr feingold said then he ventured into the turf of his hearing on the substantive issue of executive power vs legislative roles but historically a czar is an autocrat , and it s not surprising that some americans feel uncomfortable about supposedly allpowerful officials taking over areas of the government while there is a long history of the use of white house advisers and czars , that does not mean we can assume they are constitutionally appropriate in expressing disappointment that obama aides didn t see fit to appear , mr feingold took a swipe at the administration s public strategy of batting back these charges over the air or in the public arena of blogs or tv \( anita dunn , the communications director for the administration , picked apart the glenn beck hit list of 32 czars a few weeks back on the white house blog , which has of late become an online war room for taking on its nemesis , fox news and in particular , glenn beck \) the white house seems to want to fight the attacks against it for having too many czars on a political level rather than a substantive level , mr feingold said i don t think that s the right approach if there are good answers to the questions that have been raised , why not give them instead of attacking the motives or good faith of those who have raised questions \? at the white house briefing on tuesday , robert gibbs , the press secretary , dismissed the hearing with nary a positive thought i would assume that congress and senator feingold have more weighty topics to grapple with than something like this while the feingold hearing offered few sparks , there were indeed thoughtful and amusing moments bradley patterson , who served under both the eisenhower and nixon administrations and is a senior fellow at the brookings institute , discussed the relative concept of a czar being above and beyond the summoning of senators as for nancyann deparle , the obama administration s health czar who is deeply involved in health care reform in congress , he noted , citing an article by the times s sheryl gay stolberg last month when senator dianne feinstein expressed misgivings about how expanding medicaid would affect california s budget , ms deparle gathered some charts and dropped by the senator s home on saturday they spent nearly three hours talking over coffee in mrs feinstein s den , unquote rather unczarlike behavior or his anecdote when alcatraz was seized when he served under leonard garment , a special adviser to nixon , mr patterson recounted it was november 20 , 1969 i was executive assistant to leonard garment on the nixon white house staff the tickers came out with the news , indians seize alcatraz mr garment turned to me and said , patterson , who has alcatraz \? i said , mr garment , i don t know , but i ll find out it turned out to be the general services administration which has authority over surplus federal real property mr garment said , get the who s the head of it \? a gentleman named robert kunzig mr garment said , get kunzig on the phone or i ll get him on the phone he talked to mr kunzig , and he said , mr administrator , what are you going to do about the indians on alcatraz \? and the administrator \( inaudible \) he said , i m appointed by the senate and by the president , confirmed by the senate this is my responsibility , and it s my agency , the general services administration i m going to call in the marshals , and we re going to yank them out of there at noon tomorrow mr garment said , mr administrator , you will do no such thing that s the wrong thing to do it s a terrible policy to follow , and i m countermanding you and the administrator said , what do you mean \? my i m the administrator here i m responsible this is my i have the authority mr garment said , you ll do exactly what i tell you to do the administrator said , i ll never talk to you again , slammed down the phone we did not bring in the marshals , and we negotiated with the indians on alcatraz for 18 months and finally removed them peacefully without any violence talk about a walk down memory lane other witnesses talked about language in law dating back 30 years ago , giving the president authority to make such appointments but some also suggested that during the nomination process for cabinet secretaries and others requiring senate confirmation , that the senators themselves could indeed require from the nominees that not only would they themselves , but presidential advisers within their jurisdiction be commanded to appear before congressional panel during inquiries the discussion about congress requiring the testimony of presidential advisers also reached deep into inquiries and then returned to rather recent actions tj halstead , of the congressional reearch service , noted that since world war ii , there were about 75 instances when presidential advisers came before congressional committees certainly , as we saw today , the administration simply declined the invitation to supply a witness to today s hearing and at that point , it becomes a question for a committee and congress as an institution as to whether or not to assert the institutional prerogatives and powers that it has to compel testimony from certain individuals he used as an example of a problem for congress the recent , protracted efforts force harriet miers , the bush white house counsel , and karl rove , the top bush adviser , to appear to talk about the firings of united states attorneys he offered a different option , to get a commitment from say , the secretary of the treasury or to any individual so appointed or to any other position that they would not only adhere to that agreement in relation to their generalities but also to inquiries from the committee as to the impact that these advisers or other personnel are having on their carrying out or conduct of the legal authorities that are vested specifically in them the administration will have another opportunity to sit down and discuss the matter before the homeland security committee next week if white house aides choose to do so senator susan collins , republican of maine , the ranking republican on the panel , has already questioned the need for a cybersecurity czar , and she was one of the senators signing the letter to the white house seeking more information she issued a statement today upon our inquiry into her interests for seeking further amplification next week czar positions within the executive office of the president are largely insulated from effective congressional oversight and many czars appointed by this administration seem either to duplicate or dilute the statutory authority and responsibilities that congress already has conferred upon cabinetlevel officers and other senior executive branch officials indeed , many of these new czars appear to occupy positions of greater responsibility and authority than officials who already have been confirmed by the senate whether in the white house or elsewhere , these czar appointments are not subject to the senate s constitutional advice and consent role little information is available concerning their responsibilities and authorities there is no careful senate examination of their character and qualifications and we are speaking here of some of the most senior positions within our government the appointments of so many czars have muddied the waters , causing confusion and risking miscommunication going forward will the white house take more seriously the efforts of senators to talk about this , in a confined , respected space \? we ll see
even before the last weekend , some of their fans were calling on the team s general manager , , to wave the white flag they had seen enough inept play , deflating losses and debilitating injuries to call for minaya to trade the team s older players and stars for young prospects and try to field a more competitive team next season throw in the towel and break up the , from a writer named ceadan the writer added a midseason fire sale is needed the mets need to weed and seed' and hope for the best with a revamped 2010 lineup the mets are in third place , four and a half games behind the frontrunning philadelphia phillies , and they are certainly aware of the bind they are in minaya could trade some of the team s few prospects for a midlevel player like aubrey huff , the orioles' first baseman but that may not be enough to keep the mets in contention , and it could hobble them in years to come when they try to replace their aging players yet trading away stars , or even productive veterans , for prospects with no guarantee that they will perform as hoped could cause a more destructive chain of events sales of season tickets , luxury suites , concessions , parking and merchandise may decline advertising in the ballpark and on sny , the team s regional cable network , may slip , too that is why people who follow the business of baseball say that the mets are unlikely to make wholesale changes to their roster during the season , as some fans hope it would really impact their business model , said vince gennaro , the author of who is a consultant to the cleveland indians and other teams it s not just the perception of the lack of demand for tickets , but also the core problem of 10 , 000 empty seats that would cost them a fortune in lost revenue sny s ratings would tank , too teams in new york , where fans expect winners year after year , have been brutalized when they overhauled their clubs turned into a ghost town for seven years after the when the knicks finished in last place two seasons ago , there were thousands of empty seats at madison square garden and chants of fire isiah , referring to isiah thomas , then the team s president the situation is different now for the mets because they play in a new 800 million ballpark , not shea stadium , which was owned by the city like other new ballparks , the financing for the 41 , 800seat was based on the assumption that the team would have a steady stream of customers for its luxury boxes and premium seats , some of which cost 500 a game if minaya and the mets organization signal to fans that 2009 is a lost cause and that 2010 may be , too , ticket sales for the remaining home games will suffer fans with tickets , already struggling to resell them at face value because of the team s poor play , will be stuck with even bigger losses at the same time , representatives from the mets' ticket office would have a harder time trying to market seasonticket plans and suite rentals for 2010 when the team is in contention , fans feel more compelled to renew their ticket plans but if they see that the team is being dismantled and sinking in the standings , they may opt for a cheaper plan or none at all companies , particularly smaller ones with limited entertainment budgets , may drop their seats or suites it just shows that when the dollars are that high , patience is n't high on the list , said you expect great things and great returns , whether you 're a fan spending a lot on tickets or owners spending a lot on players the mets , of course , expect great things from their team executives at the club say that the team is a very good one that has been hit with a string of unfortunate injuries when players like jose reyes , carlos beltran and carlos delgado return as expected after the allstar break , the team should rebound any talk of overhauling the team is grossly exaggerated at this point , said dave howard , the mets' vice president for operations howard added that the team s finances were strong and would remain so once the economy rebounded to be sure , the bonds issued to pay for citi field are backed partly by revenue from luxury suites and premium seats because the companies and individuals who buy them sign multiyear contracts , the mets are in no imminent danger of failing to meet their obligations to bondholders but if the team goes into a swoon that lasts several years , the situation could change , said kurt krummenacker , a vice president at moody s investors service , which rates the bonds issued to pay for the stadium at baa3 , the lowest investment grade we only have one year of revenue to work off of , and that s benefited from the bump of the new stadium and the newcar feel , he said but what happens next year is an open question
shenzhen , the thieves often strike at dusk , when children are playing outside and their parents are distracted by exhaustion deng huidong lost her 9monthold son in the blink of an eye as a man yanked him from the grip of his 7yearold sister near the doorway of their home the car did not even stop as a pair of arms reached out the window and grabbed the boy sun zuo , a gregarious 3 1 2yearold , was lured off by someone with a slice of mango and a toy car , an abduction that was captured by police surveillance cameras peng gaofeng was busy with customers when a man snatched his 4yearold son from the plaza in front of his shop as throngs of factory workers enjoyed a spring evening i turned away for a minute , and when i called out for him he was gone , mr peng said these and thousands of other children stolen from the teeming industrial hubs of china s pearl river delta have never been recovered by their parents or by the police but anecdotal evidence suggests the children do not travel far although some are sold to buyers in singapore , malaysia and vietnam , most of the boys are purchased domestically by families desperate for a male heir , parents of abducted children and some law enforcement officials who have investigated the matter say the demand is especially strong in rural areas of south china , where a tradition of favoring boys over girls and the country s strict family planning policies have turned the sale of stolen children into a thriving business su qingcai , a tea farmer from the mountainous coast of fujian province , explained why he spent 3 , 500 last year on a 5yearold boy a girl is just not as good as a son , said mr su , 38 , who has a 14yearold daughter but whose biological son died at 3 months it does n't matter how much money you have if you do n't have a son , you are not as good as other people who have one the centuriesold tradition of cherishing boys and a custom that dictates that a married woman moves in with her husband s family is reinforced by a modern reality without a real social safety net in china , many parents fear they will be left to fend for themselves in old age the extent of the problem is a matter of dispute the chinese government insists there are fewer than 2 , 500 cases of human trafficking each year , a figure that includes both women and children but advocates for abducted children say there may be hundreds of thousands sun haiyang , whose son disappeared in 2007 , has collected a list of 2 , 000 children in and around shenzhen who have disappeared in the past two years he said none of the children in his database had been recovered it s like fishing a needle out of the sea , he said mr peng , who started an ad hoc group for parents of stolen children , said some of the girls were sold to orphanages they are the lucky ones who often end up in the united states or europe after adoptive parents pay fees to orphanages that average 5 , 000 the unlucky ones , especially older children , who are not in demand by families , can end up as prostitutes or indentured laborers some of the children begging or hawking flowers in major chinese cities are in the employ of criminal gangs that abducted them i do n't even want to talk about what happens to these children , mr peng said , choking up here in shenzhen and the constellation of manufacturing towns packed with migrant workers , desperate families say they get almost no help from the local police in case after case , they said , the police insisted on waiting 24 hours before taking action , and then claimed that too much time had passed to mount an effective investigation several parents , through their own guile and persistence , have tracked down surveillance video images that clearly show the kidnappings in progress yet even that can fail to move the police , they say they told me a face is n't enough , that they need a name , said cai xinqian , who obtained tape from a store camera that showed a woman leading his 4yearold away if i had a name , i could find him myself chen fengyi , whose 5yearold son was snatched from outside her apartment building in huizhou , said she called the police the moment she realized he was missing they told me they would come right over , she said i went outside to wait for them and they never came when she is not scouring the streets at night for her son , ms chen and her husband go to the local police station and fall to their knees we cry and beg them to help , she said , and every time they say , why are you so hung up on this one thing \? ' many parents take matters into their own hands they post fliers in places where children are often sold and travel the country to stand in front of kindergartens as they let out a few who run shops have turned their storefronts into missing person displays we spend our life savings , we borrow money , we will do anything to find our children , said mr peng , who owns a longdistance phone call business in gongming , not far from shenzhen there is a hole in our hearts that will never heal the reluctance of the police to investigate such cases has a variety of explanations kidnappers often single out the children of migrant workers because they are transients who may fear the local police and whose grievances are not treated as high priorities moreover , the police in china s authoritarian bureaucracy are rarely rewarded for responding to crimes affecting people who do not have much political clout mr peng said the police preferred not to even open a missing person s inquiry because unsolved cases made them appear inefficient , reducing their annual bonuses there are exceptions in a number of highprofile cases , the police have cracked down on trafficking rings and publicized the results but such help remains rare , parents say mr peng says that boys' abductions are a growing problem that only the central government can address he and others have been agitating for the establishment of a dna database for children and stronger antitrafficking laws that would penalize people who buy stolen children if the government can launch satellites and catch spies , they can figure out how to find stolen children , said mr peng , who helps run a web site called  chen shiqu , the director of the office of combating human trafficking , a twoyearold government agency based in beijing , said the problem of stolen children was exaggerated he said that , contrary to parent advocates and some news reports , the number of cases was on the decline , although he was unable to provide figures to back up that assertion just say they are dropping by 10 percent a year , he said he added that if parents were unsatisfied with the police response , they should call 110 , china s equivalent of 911 yang jianchang , a legislator in shenzhen , said he had been trying to get the central government s attention , with little success two years ago , he said , a group of local businessmen tried to start a foundation to track missing children but the government , which requires that the establishment of private organizations be approved , has yet to grant them permission last june , after he sent a report on the issue to the central government and got no response , mr yang started sending the ministry of civil affairs a copy every month or so i just do n't understand why no one is paying attention to this problem , he said we need someone in the central government who will fight for the rights of the people , someone who has a conscience for the parents of missing children , the heartbreak and the frustration have turned into anger last september , about 40 families traveled to the capital to call attention to the plight of abducted children they staged a brief protest at the headquarters of the national television broadcaster , but within minutes , dozens of police officers arrived to haul them away they dragged us by our hair and said , how dare you question the government , ' said peng dongying , who lost her 4yearold son i hate myself for my child s disappearance , but i hate society more for not caring all of us have this pain in common , and we will do anything to get back our children in anxi , a verdant county in fujian where some of shenzhen s stolen boys are thought to have been sold , people focus more on the pain of the families without sons zhen zibao , a shopkeeper in the kuidou , said that buying a son was widely accepted and that stolen children could be found in most towns and villages she and other residents noted that when a daughter married and moved to her husband s home , it often left her parents without a caretaker in old age then there is the dowry , a financial burden that falls to the family of a bride if you have only girls , you do n't feel right inside , said ms zhen , who has one child , an 11yearold son you feel your status is lower than everyone else although many chinese still cherish male heirs , the communist party has largely succeeded in easing ageold attitudes about gender in major cities , where onechild families have become the norm , many parents say they are happy to have a daughter and no son still , in many rural areas , including anxi county , a resident whose first child is a daughter is allowed to have a second having a third child , however , can mean steep fines as high as 5 , 800 and other penalties that include the loss of a breadwinner s job a boy , by contrast , can often be bought for half that amount , and authorities may turn a blind eye if the child does not need to be registered as a new birth in the locale in some cases , local officials may even encourage people desperate for a son to buy one after their 3monthold son died , zhou xiuqin said , the village family planning official went to her home and tried to comfort her and her husband , who was compelled to have a vasectomy after the birth of the boy , their second child he said , do n't cry , stop crying , you can always buy another one , ' ms zhou recalled ms zhou and her husband , mr su , the tea farmer , were still in mourning in october 2007 when they spotted a child at a buddhist temple in their village , dailai , a picturesque hamlet of 800 people nestled in the fold of steep mountains the boy was eating candy like he was hungry , mr su recalled everything he was wearing was too small for him a man with the boy claimed to be his father he said that he was from a nearby town and had three sons , but that he needed money to take his ill wife to the hospital i asked how much , said mr su , an earnest man who works long hours in a clothing factory when he is not tending his tea plants after some quick bargaining , the price was dropped to 3 , 500 from 4 , 100 , and a few hours later , after borrowing money from friends and family members , they took the boy home they named him jiabao , which means guarantor of the family their love for their new son was boundless they bought him new clothing and had their daughter drop out of middle school to take care of him they did not think much of the fact that jiabao did not understand the dialect spoken in that part of fujian and seemed indifferent to the local cuisine mr su insisted that he never imagined that the boy had been stolen last august , mr su learned the truth after the police in sichuan province arrested the man who had sold them the child the man , part of a ring of seven people who had abducted 11 children , had sold four of them to families in their township the man , according to the police , has since been given a 12year sentence by the time the couple got home from work the day they got the news , their son and the three other stolen children in their village had already been taken away by the police the couple was inconsolable we were lied to , we were swindled , mr su said as his wife s eyes welled up there was , however , a small consolation a sympathetic policeman in sichuan , the province where the boy was stolen , helped put them in touch with his birth parents the two couples have since been in frequent contact mr su said the real parents held no grudge , acknowledging that the family had cared for their son well the father was so grateful , he told mr su he would be on the lookout for local families who had two sons but were too poor to care for them he said that way i do n't need to deal with child traffickers anymore , mr su said
when pressed to elaborate on his remark about difficulties with certain mahler symphonies in an interview last week , daniel barenboim said it s not that i consider them less complete you know , i came relatively late to mahler i did n't conduct any mahler symphonies until the early '70s , and i did n't like a lot of it and therefore did n't feel that i really wanted to tackle them some of it is artificial for me , and i do n't feel anything the only symphony he named was the outsize eighth , which leaves even some ardent mahlerians relatively cold but the second , third and fourth , that grand trilogy of works so much of a piece in their sharing of musical themes and literary sources yet so wildly varied in their towering or melting emotions \? for whatever reasons , those three works fell to to conduct in the chronological survey of the mahler symphonies that he and mr barenboim are presenting with the staatskapelle berlin at carnegie hall and from thursday through saturday mr boulez made the staatskapelle sound like a different orchestra from the one heard in mr barenboim s performance of the first symphony on wednesday still not a great orchestra , but a good one , seemingly overworked from the outset in the second on thursday the playing was more settled , with greater focus , intensity and unanimity despite problems among the brass instruments throughout , the earlier movements were compelling , and made more so by the mezzosoprano michelle deyoung s stirring delivery of the urlicht stamina , mr barenboim said in the interview , should not be a problem , since the staatskapelle , of which he is music director , is also the orchestra of the staatsoper unter den linden in berlin and thus used to long nights and weeks of opera it played the mahler symphonies in quick succession in 2007 in berlin and later repeated them in two parts in vienna still , these hugely demanding works are not yet familiar enough to the players to allow for the element of rote that may help them through many a lengthy wagner opera , and the orchestra is going through a punishing 12 days of rehearsal and performance here it certainly seemed that fatigue was already a factor in the second symphony , and at one point in the finale the erratic brass players threatened to bring the performance to its knees the orchestra regained its balance under mr boulez s steady hand and joined by the soprano dorothea r schmann , ms deyoung and the excellent westminster symphonic choir mustered a proper note of sustained triumph at the end yet this performance did not bode entirely well for the third symphony on friday , with its resounding opening horn call and its heavy reliance on brass instruments elsewhere as it happened , that horn call was just fine and the brass playing throughout only mildly accident prone a good thing , because this work is a boulez specialty , and he was masterly , turning that huge and unwieldy first movement into a model of symphonic logic the climaxes seemed all the more powerful for being meticulously prepared as part of a measured whole though the woodwinds lacked the tonal luster needed to make the swaying subsidiary theme shimmer , the rest of the movement , and of the work , was almost wholly persuasive ms deyoung made much of another haunted tune in o mensch ! after all that heavy lifting , the concert on saturday was a picture of relaxation and ease ms r schmann sang six songs from mahler s cycle des knaben wunderhorn , and mr boulez and the orchestra gave a lovely performance of the fourth symphony the strings were especially fine in the songful moments leading into the outburst before the finale in that finale , as in the wunderhorn songs , ms r schmann sang with beautiful soaring or lilting tone but tended toward overcuteness in her manner and in the finale of the second symphony on thursday she gave an almost operatic cast to a part whose character should be defined by its first entry , when it emerges ever so subtly from the chorus , a gorgeous bloom rising out of the melody of the massed sopranos in all cases simplicity might have served better among the hardworking musicians , none worked harder than wolfdieter batzdorf , the concertmaster in all the concerts he was equally effective in sinuous melodies and in the morbid dance of the fourth symphony s scherzo , with its weirdly retuned fiddle christian batzdorf , a trumpeter and the concertmaster s son , made fine work of the posthorn solos in the third s scherzando

el beit is a homey coffee shop in williamsburg , brooklyn , where the young gather at long wooden tables , glued to their laptops , totally oblivious to their surroundings arriving there on one recent wintry morning in blue jeans , a gray hoodie and wool cap , mark essen quickly booted up , and his screen came alive with a series of jeweltone grids it was a video game of his own design , flywrench , yet it was something more it will be one of the first sights greeting visitors next month when the on the lower east side opens its inaugural triennial exhibition mr essen , 22 , the youngest of the 50 artists in the show , will be making his museum debut with flywrench , which the public will be invited to play on an arcadestyle console the goal is to get to the square , he said you are constantly moving , but at the same time constantly failing it s not about thinking , it s about reacting the images in flywrench are reminiscent of the gridbased canvases that brought the painter peter halley to attention in the 1980s as mr essen began scrolling through the game , each move seemed more treacherous than the next , a blend of art and brain teaser given that video art has long since entered the contemporary canon , it may come as little surprise that mr essen s game is featured amid paintings , drawing , photography , sculpture and films still , critics will no doubt question whether new york needs yet another giant survey of contemporary art after all , the whitney museum of american art has its lovetohateit biennial , and the ps 1 contemporary art center in queens its sprawling greater new york this is different , said lisa phillips , the new museum s director , in an interview at its twoyearold building on the bowery it s a really focused exhibition about a generation flippantly titled the generational younger than jesus , the buildingwide show , which runs from april 8 through june 14 , will present an international sampling of artists 33 and under who were born and bred in the computer age they constitute the largest demographic since the baby boomers , said massimiliano gioni , director of special exhibitions at the new museum , who organized the show with laura hoptman , the new museum s senior curator , and lauren cornell , the museum s adjunct curator mr gioni added sociologists and marketing experts have already labeled this generation everything from the millennials and generation y to igeneration and generation me in china 50 percent of the population is younger than 33 this generation of artists are the most important agents of change in this century the exhibition s curators also point out that turning points in recent art history have often involved young practitioners jasper johns painted his first flag at 24 matthew barney had his first group show at 23 eva hesse burst into the scene when she was just 25 while other ambitious survey exhibitions in new york tend to focus primarily on american artists , or those working in this country , younger than jesus is international in scope its 50 artists hail from more than 25 countries , including algeria , china , colombia , venezuela , poland , lebanon and turkey reflecting the tough economic climate it is a lowbudget endeavor the show was only a year in the making rather than trotting the globe visiting artists , the curators relied on their internet savvy , reaching out to 150 writers , teachers , artists , critics , curators and bloggers worldwide , for recommendations from around 600 suggested names , the curators whittled the group down to the final 50 if there is a prevailing practice among these young artists , it is a hopscotch across disciplines most of these artists say they do everything from book making and painting to sculpture and performance it s a postmedium attitude , said ms hoptman , one of the curators none of these artists are constrained by what they make their work out of , or how they make it and that s very new kerstin br tsch , a 30yearold germanborn artist in the show , works out of a williamsburg studio filled with paintings , sculptures , posters , books , backdrops and even stockings it s all very organic , she said in addition to own work , she creates art as part of a collective called das institute she shares a studio with adele r der , a partner in das institute whom she met at school in berlin the two women frequently make computergenerated images that can become anything , as ms br tsch put it ms br tsch then uses the images as the basis for her paintings , and ms r der transfers the designs onto fabrics ms r der has even created a line of stockings that a friend , the artist debo eilers , used in a recent performance i see my paintings in relation to something else , ms br tsch said in addition to abstract romantic compositions that cover the floors and walls of her scruffy studio , there are shelves of handmade books of her creation she makes plexiglass stands to show them off some of the books are filled with original drawings , others with appropriated images lifted from books or catalogs or designs she generated from shadings manipulated on a photocopier books are among the many things that fill the midtown studio of josh smith , who at 33 is one of the more senior and recognizable names in the exhibition a solo show of his paintings is currently on view at luhring augustine in chelsea mr smith creates in bulk the studio brims with waisthigh stacks of 5by4foot silkscreens painted in abstract colorful designs , shelves of books he has made and racks and walls filled with paintings i stack them up because i really love them all , he said it s the idea of equality mr smith has created some 200 to 300 collages and paintings that incorporate everything from abstract swirls and scrawls to recognizable natural objects like fish and leaves some of his paintings also have his name scrawled across them in different ways he makes books for himself and other artists books are my way of thinking , mr smith said that he is at once a painter , a publisher and a printmaker who shrugs off limits made mr smith a natural for younger than jesus , said mr gioni , the curator i like the element of overproduction , he said , that he makes far more than is absolutely necessary'
the potential legalization of marijuana in california should be embraced , if only as a sign of a cultural shift from an era of fantasybased debt creation to a realitybased era of resource maximization in order to more firmly reinforce such a paradigm shift in the minds of the electorate , sacramento would be well advised in addition to track on open websites the transparent utilization of marijuana taxation say , to fund state health programs and , in similar fashion with offshore oil and gas royalties that fund rail construction and operation the taxpayer , in a time of deep cynicism and despair , needs to witness and be a part of positive transformation my vision , which i have written about continually here at gregorus , is that lightrail users will travel down pico blvd in los angeles in trains that bear the following placard this rail system 100 funded by offshore oil and gas royalites since the beginning of the financial crisis , there have been two principal explanations for why so many banks made such disastrous decisions the first is structural regulators did not regulate institutions failed to function as they should rules and guidelines were either inadequate or ignored the second explanation is that wall street was incompetent , that the traders and investors didn t know enough , that they made extravagant bets without understanding the consequences but the first wave of postmortems on the crash suggests a third possibility that the roots of wall street s crisis were not structural or cognitive so much as they were psychological the guy is feeling his legacy and going for broke this is a huge moment in the evolutionfromrevolution enshrining the original source \( lenin , mao , khomeini \) , but doing so in such a way as to recognize there is no single stalinist successor but rather the potential for a plurality of schools once that happens , the revolution is truly dead and there is competition to see who best serves the people it is true that i did wrong and failed at the largest of levels , but equally true is the fact that god can make good of our respective wrongs in life in this vein , while none of us has the chance to attend our own funeral , in many ways i feel like i was at my own in the past weeks , and surprisingly i am thankful for the perspective it has afforded
they say you ca n't take it with you , but in certain times and places people thought otherwise , and they stocked the tombs of their most illustrious citizens with everything they would need in the next world clothing , food , money , reading material , pets and even live servants we do n't know if this was helpful for the intended beneficiaries , but the effective preservation of much art and material culture has been a great boon for modern scholars of ancient civilizations a case in point is a small , interesting exhibition at the china institute , noble tombs at mawangdui art and life in the changsha kingdom , third century bce to first century ce organized by chen jianming , director of the hunan provincial museum , the show presents about 70 out of more than 3 , 000 objects excavated from three tombs discovered in the early 1970s in hunan province in southeastern china situated in a suburb of the modern city of changsha , the tombs at mawangdui belonged to three related nobles the marquis of dai , his wife and their son because they had escaped the notice of plunderers and because of the unusually wellpreserved state of their contents , the tombs are considered among the major archaeological discoveries of the 20th century momentous as this sounds , the exhibition is not one of those astounding , blockbuster compendiums of shiny gold and bejeweled treasures most of the material , including samples of fabric , lacquer ware , lamps , grooming implements and wooden figurines , is more remarkable for historical than artistic reasons scholarly specialists will be most appreciative a tattered , padded gown shows the type of clothing favored by lady dai as a note in the catalog explains , it has a hem of brocade with pile circles the earliest teased fabric discovered in the world so far several pieces of finely woven silk on display are also said to be among the earliest known examples of their kind two fragmentary pages of writing are from one of the world s first books of advice for maintaining good health it focuses on sexual concerns , and these two pages in particular address impotence in elderly men too bad they are not illustrated also of historical note , but more visually arresting , is a small lance the business end of a spear made of translucent blue glass the only glass lance to have been excavated in china , according to the catalog , it is of major importance to the study of chinese glasswork the show s most artistically compelling attraction is a set of five wooden figurines representing musicians the smoothly carved performers kneel before miniature stringed instruments in fulllength robes and bowlshaped hats with their elegantly curved lines and nubby little hands , they call to mind the folksy modernist sculptures of elie nadelman a catalog entry explains that after the spring and autumn period \( 770476 bc \) , it became a general practice to substitute figurines in place of living people in tombs of the deceased there is a lot of black and vermilion lacquer work in the show , including covered bowls , a ladle , trays , sets of dishes and large wine containers almost none of these objects display the kind of highly wrought finish and intricate construction you might associate with the finest lacquerware of more recent derivation , but they have a homely appeal , and their delicate , swirly and geometric patterns are rewarding to study they also show what sort of domestic items a welltodo family would possess for entertaining the outstanding piece of lacquer work is a round , twotiered box containing nine variously shaped smaller boxes placed in cavities carved out of the lower level these glossy , brown and white containers held cosmetics , combs , needles and other articles for personal grooming used by lady dai , a k a xin zhui because some of the objects found in the tombs were too fragile to travel , they appear here in the form of modern reproductions there is a beautiful , richly lacquered copy of one of a set of nesting coffins and a recreation of a tshaped painting that lay face down on the innermost coffin in a fascinating catalog essay , the art historian eugene wang explains that the complex iconography covering the coffin and the painting was supposed to guide the dead person s soul through progressive stages of the afterlife in a more downtoearth vein , yu yanjiao of the hunan provincial museum observes in another essay that one reason the mawangdui excavation caused such a worldwide stir among archaeologists was the extraordinary state of preservation of xin zhui s body , which unfortunately is not in the exhibition ms yu notes that as a result of preservation techniques that amaze modern scientists , her outer body is intact and moist her subcutaneous tissues are soft and elastic her joints are movable her eyebrows and the hair in her nose survive the tympanic membrane of her left ear remains intact the loops and whorls on her fingers and toes are clear her inner organs , connective tissues , muscle tissue , bone tissue , and cartilage are all fairly well preserved not bad for a 2 , 000yearold lady
and the new yankee stadium are finally open , the culmination of nearly two decades when it appeared that no ballpark could possibly be built in new york city the announced their intentions in the mid1980s , regularly and loudly demanding a renovated home in the bronx or a new stadium and threatening to leave for new jersey if the city failed them the came next , nearly a decade later , quietly seeking a replacement for  plans were drawn and financing schemes proposed mayors including the yankees fan entered and left office but recessions intervened the era of financing ballparks with massive infusions of public money faded costs rose and s indecision would he keep his yankees in the bronx , ship them to manhattan s west side or cross the river to new jersey \? not only delayed making a deal for his team , but one for the mets as well meanwhile , 19 baseball teams opened new ballparks starting in 1990 and only one major sports facility was built in the five boroughs in that period arthur ashe stadium in flushing meadowscorona park , the legacy of a tennisloving mayor , david n dinkins before that , it was madison square garden , which opened in 1968 building new stadiums in new york would prove to be as complex and difficult as developing other megaprojects , partly because of the scrutiny on highprofile ventures with public investment starting with the fiscal crisis in the 1970s , we starved the public sector in building all sorts of infrastructure except for the javits center , said mitchell l moss , a professor of urban policy and planning at new york university he added , elected officials were afraid of them and communities were apprehensive of them still , there was no shortage of stadium plans , most of them for the fickle yankees as the governor , mario m cuomo proposed building a stadium and garage over the long island rail road yards on the west side of manhattan in 1993 and then , facing criticism , tacked weeks later to suggest a renovation of yankee stadium by 1996 , giuliani was pushing the west side option as easy to finance , plus a new mets stadium in flushing a doublebarreled proposal that he felt would help a new york bid for the 2008 summer olympics over two terms , he offered three financing plans , all with the city paying about half the cost of the stadiums none advanced publicly , it appeared that satisfying the yankees was the city s and the state s main priority while steinbrenner blustered about parking , safety , traffic and attendance in the bronx , , the mets' principal owner , never looked to move beyond shea s parking lot the mets were on the radar , cuomo said i was talking to both teams , and it was my understanding that fred should sit back and whatever the yankees got would set a precedent for the mets he had nothing to lose you could n't do them simultaneously , it would have been too much , so we concentrated on the yankees jeff wilpon , the mets' chief operating officer , said the mets were not on a parallel track with the yankees until the team submitted a proposal for a 457 million , 50 , 000seat , retractabledome stadium next to shea , with an ebbets fieldlike rotunda , in 1995 we were n't looking for the same dollars as they were , but something equivalent , he said in 1998 , giuliani s plan to use the commercial rent tax to finance the city s halfshare in the stadiums which died in a nasty political battle with the city council speaker peter f vallone was followed days later by fred wilpon unveiling a model of his ballpark but neither wilpon s miniature stadium nor the yankees' second world series championship in three seasons was capable of spurring ballpark construction giuliani tried to leave office at the end of 2001 three months after the sept 11 terror attacks with a grand slam a nonbinding proposal to split the 16 billion cost of two stadiums but his successor , michael r bloomberg , quickly canceled the plan as impossible during a recession , and once again the stadium issue turned dormant jeff wilpon said he is certain that absent the sept 11 attacks , bloomberg would have proceeded with giuliani s plan and stadium construction would have soon begun randy levine , the yankees' president , said i realized the gravity of what was going on there would be no direct city participation in the financing of the stadiums the realization prompted the yankees in 2004 to develop a financing plan that had as its centerpiece the shifting of revenue that would normally be shared with other major league teams to pay for largely taxexempt bonds that would be issued by the city here , the yankees , in the city s view , moved aggressively past the mets by the spring of 2005 , daniel l doctoroff , then the deputy mayor for economic development , said in an interview , we were pretty close to a deal with the yankees and nowhere with the mets wilpon said , the yankees kept moving on and we sort of held back but the baseball stadiums needed a catalyst and got one unexpectedly through a third stadium the 22 billion football complex that was being planned by the jets on the same west side site that cuomo had once recommended to the yankees the massive stadium was to double as an olympic stadium if the city were chosen as the site for the 2012 summer games but a state panel s rejection of the stadium in june 2005 sent the bloomberg administration and olympic officials racing for an alternative to satisfy the international olympic committee before it named the 2012 host city they cast their eyes from manhattan to flushing , and , over a frantic few days , made a deal with the mets for a ballpark that would expand to olympic size in 2012 and contract afterward the mets had the deal whether the city got the olympics or not in three days we brought the mets up to parity , doctoroff said the yankees got their deal done over the same period , partly because of how close it had been to completion , and also agreed to host the mets during the olympics , if necessary levine said that even without the jets olympic stadium s demise , it would have taken little time to complete a yankees deal wilpon agreed if they did deals for the jets and yankees , he said , what were they going to say , you ca n't have anything' \? the two stadium deals were announced in 2005 within three days of each other and three weeks later the 2012 summer games were awarded to london construction began in 2006 in flushing and in the bronx , and fans can now judge bloomberg s sports legacy ballparks that cost their teams 23 billion but were made possible by almost 12 billion in city and statefunded infrastructure and tax breaks
when presidentelect barack obama takes office tuesday he will be facing high expectations americans expect their presidents to hit the ground running , and the initial 100 days set the tone for a president s first term that was not always the case until the adoption of the twentieth amendment in 1933 , presidents were not inaugurated until march 4 congress often did not convene until the following december , and a president s first message to congress was usually delivered at that time even then a president was not expected to take the lead his constitutional responsibility was to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , and the public assumed that the legislative initiative rested with congress there were two exceptions abraham lincoln called the newly elected 37th congress into special session in july 1861 to deal with the rebellion in the south and in 1933 franklin delano roosevelt ordered the 73rd congress to meet thursday , march 9 five days after he had taken the oath of office to deal with the nation s banking crisis roosevelt s mythical 100 days , the gold standard by which all subsequent presidents have been measured , date not from the time he was sworn in but from the date congress convened congress eventually adjourned in the early morning hours of july 16 , 1933 , exactly 100 days later while many americans think roosevelt had the entire new deal in mind for the special session , he in fact initially assumed that congress would deal only with the banking crisis and then adjourn the president had closed the nation s banks by executive order and , like lincoln in the civil war , needed legislative authority to confirm his action and reorganize the financial system when congress met on march 9 , fdr s emergency banking act was introduced in the house with the ink still wet there were no committee hearings , no debate , no amendments the measure was whooped through with bipartisan support and no roll call most members had not read the bill , and took on faith what the leadership presented three hours later the bill passed the senate \( 737 \) , and an hour later roosevelt added his signature the entire legislative process , from the bill s introduction in the house to the president s signature , took less than six hours now , with the legislative tide running so strongly in his favor , roosevelt decided to hold congress in washington until the bulk of the new deal could be enacted and consummate politician that he was , roosevelt feinted right before turning left the second measure he sent to congress was an economy bill to reduce federal expenditures across the board government salaries were slashed 15 percent , and veterans benefits scaled back this was scarcely the financial stimulus the economy required , but it won the hearts of conservative legislators i m for giving the president whatever he wants , said senator arthur capper , a kansas republican after consolidating his position , fdr opened the new deal floodgates there was no preconceived order in which legislation was sent to capitol hill as soon as a measure was ready , roosevelt sent it forward carefully preparing the ground beforehand with the congressional leaders who would be responsible roosevelt was not without a sense of humor the third measure to go forward was a request to amend the volstead act to permit the sale of beer and wine i think this would be a good time for a beer , the president told his aide louis howe the 21st amendment , which repealed prohibition , was not adopted until december 5 , 1933 , but roosevelt s proposal provided interim relief bills to reorder the nation s agriculture , housing and mortgage markets followed in short order acreage allotments , price supports and crop setasides reshaped the face of american agriculture farm mortgages were refinanced and the farm credit act provided operating funds at low interest rates the urban housing market was rescued with the establishment of the home owners loan corporation , which purchased the mortgages of distressed home owners , provided money for taxes and repairs , and set repayment schedules over 30year terms at 5 percent interest the loan corporation assumed onesixth of all home mortgages in the united states , and soon made home ownership a goal to which most americans could aspire on march 21 , roosevelt asked congress for 500 million for unemployment relief congress complied and the president appointed harry hopkins to administer the program , the first ever by the federal government roosevelt was personally interested in preserving the environment and providing temporary employment for the nation s youth legislation to establish the civilian conservation corps was also introduced march 21 , and shepherded by the president himself through both houses it was signed into law 10 days later over the next six years 3 million young men were put to work reclaiming the country s natural resources the men lived in government camps , food and clothing were provided , the army supervised the camps , and the men were required to send 80 percent of their pay back to their families legislation to establish the tennessee valley authority , providing cheap electric power to one of the most poverty stricken regions of the country , was introduced april 10 and became law five weeks later the excesses of wall street , blamed by many for the depression , were reined in with the passage of the truth in securities act on may 27 if the country is to flourish , said roosevelt , capital must be invested in enterprise but those who seek to draw upon other people s money must be wholly candid regarding the facts on which the investor s judgment is asked to make american farm products more affordable on the world market , fdr took the united states off the gold standard , and congress passed followup legislation nullifying the clauses in private contracts that required payment in gold the glasssteagall act , one of the most farreaching economic measures ever enacted , required banks to divest themselves of securities operations gave the federal reserve board the authority to set interest rates and established the federal deposit insurance corporation to guarantee individual bank deposits , assuring the average citizen that his money would be protected by the government the capstone of the 100 days was the passage by congress of the national industrial recovery act an omnibus proposal governing the whole range of industrial recovery the act authorized business to establish production codes controlling prices and output , guaranteed labor s right to bargain collectively , and stipulated that industry codes should set minimum wages and maximum hours it also provided 33 billion for public works \( roughly 50 billion currently \) as a fiscal stimulant the 100 days that congress was in session in 1933 shattered all records for legislative activity roosevelt had sent 15 messages to capitol hill requesting action , and congress had responded with 15 historic pieces of legislation more significantly , perhaps , the president had become the principal player in the legislative process , and the federal government had become the primary guarantor of the nation s economy no president since has faced so desperate a financial situation , and none have enjoyed such mastery of the legislative process presidentelect obama confronts a national crisis of significant proportions the question is , can he can replicate the leadership style and the wisdom of franklin roosevelt \?

location champaignurbana , ill nickname fighting illini 2008 countdown ranking  no 19  what i said in last year s preview  even with a tough schedule , i see the illini gutting out another ninewin season there is just a ton of young , confident talent on this roster , and with the confidence built up following last fall s ninewin campaign , i don t see zook and his team having too much of a drop off would this mean the program is treading water \? hardly unlike last fall , the illini are not sneaking up on anyone in 2008 postseason reranking no 70 2008 record and recap \( 57 , 35 \) quite a slide after 2007 s magical run to the rose bowl not that the illini reverted to the twowin form that defined coach ron zook s first two seasons with the program \( a combined 419 from 20056 \) , but the team suffered a distinct dropoff in performance especially given the raised expectations surrounding the program so what went wrong \? i suppose you could blame the fourgame swing in the standings to the defense , which allowed nearly five more points \( 266 \) per game however , the illini defense also allowed less yards per game \( down to 3503 , sixth in the big ten \) , leading me to believe those additional points were partly due to the team s penchant for turnovers could you blame the offense \? this unit gained 1695 yards per game on the ground , down from a schoolrecord 2568 in 2007 but hold on one of my biggest question marks heading into last season may have been the illinois passing game , but the illini responded by tossing 100 more yards per game than in the season prior so what s the problem \? perhaps the fighting illini were no longer able to sneak up on its big ten opposition perhaps , for the first time in nearly a decade , illinois had a bull seye on its back i m going to chalk last season up as a learning experience now that the team is a year wiser , i m confident that the illini s improved mindset will equal a return to eight wins and a bowl appearance high point only a single win of consequence by 2724 over iowa that victory gave the illini a 54 mark , 33 in the big ten , and needing only one win in its final three games to reach bowl eligibility low point illinois lost its last three , costing it a shot at a second consecutive bowl trip the first came to a very good western michigan team \( by 2317 \) doesn t make it any less disappointing after the offense played well \( 455 total yards \) against ohio state for the second consecutive season albeit in a 3020 loss the illini scored only 10 points in a seasonending loss to northwestern tidbit ron zook is one of two active coaches in the big ten to have beaten both michigan and ohio state on the road who is the other \? none other than penn state s joe paterno this is too easy a question for a foreign language preview who has twice won in the big house \( 1994 and 1996 \) and once at the horseshoe \( 1978 \) now here s a question eleven other coaches in big ten

four seasons with the illini and 4144 over all as a college coach illinois took a step back last fall , dropping out of bowl play after reaching the rose bowl the season prior in 2007 , zook was finally able to vindicate himself after his disappointing stint at florida and an underwhelming first two seasons at illinois prior to taking the illinois job , zook spent three season as the coach at florida , where he compiled three consecutive top 25 finishes unfortunately , zook had the unfortunate task of replacing the legendary steve spurrier in gainesville , as spurrier cast a large shadow upon zook s entire threeyear term with the gators looking back , there is no doubt that zook s teams underachieved , but you must credit his tireless recruiting efforts for the success urban meyer has achieved in his three seasons at florida zook signed 22 of the 24 gator starters in its 2006 national title season zook was a longtime assistant on both the pro and college level before moving up to a head coach position in the nfl , zook served as an assistant with the steelers \( 199698 \) , the chiefs \( 20001 \) and the saints \( 20024 \) , the latter as defensive coordinator he has also been an assistant at some of college football s top programs cincinnati \( 198182 \) , kansas \( 1983 \) , tennessee \( 198486 \) , virginia tech \( 1987 \) , ohio state \( 198890 \) and florida \( 199195 \) returning starters 14 \( 8 offense , 6 defense \) key losses illinois has had one of the best offensive lines in the big ten in each of the past two seasons , largely due to the stellar play of left tackle xavier fulton and center ryan mcdonald each were allconference picks as seniors fulton a secondteam selection , while mcdonald followed up a secondteam pick as a junior with honorable mention honors in his final season the pair combined to make 83 career starts , with mcdonald starting all 48 games of his fouryear career it s tough enough to find new starters on the offensive line this problem is doubled when the lost starters held their roles for so long , and played at such a high level the receiver corps must replace will judson , who finished fourth on the team in receptions \( 21 \) but second in receiving yards \( 401 \) the oneyear starter also finished second on the squad in yards per reception \( 191 \) the biggest loss on defense is the allamerican cornerback vontae davis , a threeyear starter who opted to enter the nfl draft after his junior season what separated davis from other topnotch corners in the fbs was his willingness to mix it up against the run , as shown by his 78 tackles \( 7 for loss \) , a total good for second on the team davis was also strong against the pass , intercepting seven passes in his three seasons his mix of athleticism and physicality made him one of the premier defensive backs in the nation illinois will need to make some adjustments at linebacker following the graduation of britt miller , rodney pittman and sam carson a threeyear starter \( he also had four starts as a freshman \) , miller moved inside to middle linebacker for his senior season he responded with secondteam allbig ten honors , leading the illini with 132 tackles and 155 tackles for loss while tying for the team lead with six sacks pittman added 53 tackles and a sack on the outside , while carson , a threegame starter , made 36 stops , 3 for loss illinois also lost both its starting end , derek walker and will davis walker tied miller for the team lead in sacks with six \( he also made seven tackles for loss \) , with davis making 36 tackles \( another seven for loss \) with 35 sacks players to watch here s my biggest dilemma of the day should the countdown begin this section with the quarterback juice williams or the receiver arrelious benn \? the illinois media guide beautifully done , as always starts with benn , but seeing as juice is entering his senior season , this is his last shot at countdown glory juice it is williams has developed into one of the better passers in the big ten , a nearly inconceivable concept after his freshman season , when he completed only 39 percent of his passes for 1 , 489 yards he s made enormous strides in this area , actually leading the big ten in passing yards per game \( 2644 \) as a junior williams set careerhighs across the board last fall attempts , completions , completion percentage \( up to 575 \) , yards and touchdowns , though his interception total climbed to 16 this is my lone concern despite putting the ball up more often , williams has remained a premier running option , leading the illini with 719 yards rushing there s no question williams has become a more complete package , and i expect him to be a major contender for conference player of the year honors it s perhaps no coincidence that juice s development as a passer has coincided with benn s arrival , as the junior has given illinois a topnotch receiving option since his first day on campus in 2007 benn led the big ten in receiving yards per game \( 879 \) a season ago , when he became just the fourth illinois receiver in crack 1 , 000 yards in a season he finished with 67 receptions for 1 , 055 yards , earning firstteam allconference honors he s the best receiver in the big ten , but the illini need to find a clear second option the nextclosest receiver finished with only 21 catches that s the senior jeff cumberland , who , to be fair , did manage to parlay those grabs into 352 yards and 4 scores , the latter tying for the team lead cumberland is more like a second tight end , and uses his big frame to create space in the secondary also in the mix at wideout are the senior chris duvalt , the junior jarred fayson \( a former florida transfer \) and the sophomores aj jenkins \( the sleeper \) and fred sykes i m high on this unit , largely due to benn , but it would be a dynamite group if one of the thus far unproven players stepped up in 2009 the senior tight end michael hoomanawanui was a secondteam allbig 12 pick in 2008 after grabbing 25 catches for 312 yards while williams does the lion s share of work in the running game , the illini also feature the twoback combination of daniel dufrene \( 663 yards rushing \) and jason ford \( 294 yards , 8 touchdowns \) dufrene s the speedster , ford the bruiser dufrene is also a healthy target in the passing game \( 30 receptions , second on the team \) three starters are back on the offensive line the senior eric block the recipient of a sixth year of eligibility moves from left guard to center , while the senior jon asamoah returns at right guard and the sophomore jeff allen at tackle asamoah \( 25 career starts \) is the most experienced returning lineman , but allen , who makes the move to left tackle in 2009 , has the most upside allen s position change opens up a hold at right tackle , one illinois hopes to be filled by either the junior ryan palmer or the sophomore corey lewis the middle linebacker spot has been kind to the illini over the past two seasons given the coaching staff s decision to move the supremely talented martez wilson inside for his junior season , here s guessing that trend will continue wilson made 73 tackles \( 55 for loss \) and 3 sacks last year playing on the weakside , showing the speed and athleticism that made him a top national recruit in 2007 making the adjustment to the middle is never easy , but i suspect that wilson will really take a shine to his new spot , and put up the numbers to earn allconference honors despite being a junior , wilson is the most experienced member of a young linebacker corps the junior nate bussey \( 21 tackles \) , a converted safety , is a potential starter on the outside he s currently in a fight with the sophomore russell ellington for a starting nod another sophomore , ian thomas , and the junior aaron gress , a juco transfer , are the most likely starters at the second outside spot given the team s young depth , the fact that illinois elected to tender gress a scholarship speak volumes he arrived on campus in time to participate in spring practice vontae davis may be the most highprofile departure off last year s team , but i believe the secondary returns enough talent to suffer very little dropoff , if any at all the senior dere hicks has the talent to step into the role of the top cover corner on the roster though davis received the acclaim , one could make the case that hicks \( 44 tackles , 1 sack , 1 interception \) was the best player in the secondary a season ago in an effort to replace davis , illinois moved the sophomore travon bellamy from free safety to cornerback bellamy made 11 starts as a rookie , making 53 tackles his starting job is not guaranteed , however , as the sophomore tavon wilson and the freshman patrick nixonyouman remain viable options the senior donsay hardeman and the junior garrett edwards split time at strong safety last fall , but hardeman has been moved to free safety , allowing both to get on the field credit illinois for this move given the logjam at safety , the position changes allow the four most experienced performers the most playing time let s see how the group reacts to the moves position \( s \) to watch the potential is there , but i m most concerned about the illinois defensive line my fears were somewhat lessened following the junior tackle josh brent s reinstatement to the team following an offfield incident brent \( 34 tackles , 85 for loss \) will need to work his way back into the starting lineup , but he s one of the big ten s best interior linemen he s slated to be joined by the senior sirod williams , though williams will need to fully recover from an acl tear suffered prior to last season the main backups on the inside are the sophomores corey liuget and daryle ballew and the senior rahkeem smith alright , so tackle looks to be in fine shape i can t say the same about end this unit will feature a pair of seniors doug pilcher and antonio james making their debut as fulltime starters pilcher \( 21 tackles , 25 sacks \) was a parttime starter and fulltime reserve a season ago , while james played more sparingly the junior jerry brown was expected to play a major role this coming season , but his work in the classroom cost him a spot on the team the junior clay nurse \( nine tackles and a sack \) becomes the main reserve , as well as a prime candidate to push james out of the starting lineup as is , the illini may need to get major snaps from the redshirt freshmen glenn foster and whitney mercilus 2009 schedule  sept 5 missouri \( in st louis \) sept 12 illinois state sept 26 ohio state oct 3 penn state oct 10 michigan state oct 17 indiana oct 24

another tussle with missouri as well as lateseason games with cincinnati and fresno state in big ten play , the illini open up with the trio of ohio state , penn state and michigan state ouch season breakdown prediction the schedule is not easy , no but it does present the illini with countless opportunities to prove that last season was the fluke , and not 2007 that begins with the arch rivalry against missouri , a team has beaten the illini in each of the last two seasons , and continues with an intimidating start to big ten play ohio state , penn state and michigan state , though the final two come at home while the schedule will prevent illinois from , in my opinion , winning more than eight games , i do believe the fighting illini will have a very nice bounceback season illinois returns the pieces of a dynamic offense , including the big ten s best quarterbackreceiver duo in williams and benn in addition , if williams can control his turnovers , there is reason to believe even when considering its losses the illinois defense will revert back to its 2007 ways my biggest key to this team s success will be either performing well through midoctober \( say , going 32 \) or having the fortitude to rebuild after a rough start the possibility is there for a major midseason run , placing importance upon both the tough start and finish i m high on this team , and have them very much as a contender for top 25 status dream season illinois returns to the rose bowl after a 102 regular season nightmare season last fall was no fluke , but rather a sign of things to come 48 ,

the high home plate camera position produces one of baseball s fundamental shots it s the first camera you go to after a ball is hit , said bill webb , who directs network games for fox and mets games for sny but at the new yankee stadium , the yes network s home plate camera must record the action through the tall and massive safety net that protects fans behind the plate we had the choice fan safety or a tiny difference in that high home shot for yes , said randy levine , the yankees president we did this after consulting with a lot of experts still , what used to be an unimpeded shot at the old stadium where a smaller net was tucked beneath the camera position is now like looking through a schoolyard fence the old stadium had , with fenway park , the best in the big leagues home plate camera , curt smith , a sportscasting historian , said by email he said the old position was low enough to make viewers feel like a participant , not a spectator , and unimpeded by the backstop screen during saturday afternoon s yankeescubs exhibition game at the stadium , yes seemed to avoid using the camera shot as much as it normally would the team and yes have until opening day on april 16 to try to ameliorate the problem but the layout of the stadium , well known since 2006 , seems to argue against the likelihood of any possible alteration eric handler , a yes spokesman , said we re looking at everything and trying to be as creative as possible the home plate camera position was shifted from one that was originally higher and showed cables and wires levine said the netting was not a consequence of the 15billion stadium s design , but entirely about protecting fans the netting is a safety issue that has nothing to do with the premium seats , he said the netting would be the same with inexpensive seats he added if the netting were lower , it wouldn t be safe for the fans behind it at the mets citi field , webb said there are two home plate positions the lower one shows a little netting , the higher one shows none at all

on june 29 , garrett jones was the starting first baseman for indianapolis jones , 28 , who was in his fourth class aaa season , had had only a brief stint in the majors in 2007 and was not regarded as one of the top players in the pirates' system on july 24 , jones hit his 10th home run of the season for pittsburgh and tied a franchise record set in 1966 by donn clendenon for most home runs in july it has been a bit of a whirlwind for jones , a former twins farmhand who came into the season with a 208 average in 77 major league atbats jones has been on a tear since being summoned to pittsburgh to replace eric hinske , who was traded to the yankees on june 30 jones , who has mainly been an outfielder for the pirates , is hitting 317 with 10 home runs , 5 stolen bases and a 702 slugging percentage i was excited to get another chance to get up to the big leagues , jones said in a phone interview before friday s game when you first get called up and then sent down , you never know if you 're going to get back up in his first game jones went 0 for 4 , but in his second he hit his first homer for the pirates while going 3 for 5 against the mets on july 2 by the time he had played 12 games , he had seven homers , including blasts off the allstar pitchers cole hamels of the phillies and tim lincecum of the giants i think it s a little extra sweet , jones said of his homers off hamels and lincecum you hear about the big names and you get fired up to go against them and see what they have they 're just like everyone else they got to throw the ball over the plate , and you have to be patient and wait for something to hit hitting has never been jones s problem he had 158 minor league home runs before his promotion , including 38 in 2004 but with the twins he was stuck behind justin morneau , the former american league most valuable player , so his opportunities were limited the thought had occurred to him that he might never get a chance in the majors you think about it , he said you just hope that you stay healthy and try to take care of your numbers and play hard and hopefully you 'll get a shot you stay positive you 're playing baseball every day he credited a positive approach and a lack of awe with his success in his second spell in the majors it comes down to relaxing and trusting in myself , he said it s the same game regardless of whether you 're in the majors or triple a well on their way to their 17th consecutive losing season , the pirates have jettisoned most of their veteran players , including freddy sanchez , jack wilson and john grabow , and the result is a very young team that has one player over age 30 at 28 , jones may be a rookie but he is the team s fourtholdest player behind ramon vazquez , jeff salazar and ryan doumit despite his age , he says he does not feel like a veteran i feel like a rookie still , he said it feels weird being older than a lot of the guys who have been here three or four years , but i'm learning from them , and hopefully if the young guys want to ask me anything , i can help them out regardless of how he finishes the year , he has etched his name into the pirates' record book of the 1 , 749 players who have played for pittsburgh in the last 127 years , a group that includes the hall of famers willie stargell and roberto clemente , and of course barry bonds , none have hit more home runs in july , which is not lost on jones it feels pretty good , he said i'm not going to lie it would feel better if we were winning more , but at the same time it feels good and to be mentioned with those names is unbelievable photo garrett jones s 10 homers in july tied a pirates record \( photograph by gene j puskar associated press \)
baghdad the american military said wednesday that it was closely following the arrests of 15 leaders of the , plus the threatened arrests of five others , but insisted that the detentions were not part of a deliberate iraqi government campaign against these groups , which are mostly sunni and include many former insurgents military officials say their fear is that the , while relatively few so far , have created a public perception that the government is cracking down on the groups , which could undermine the awakening program , widely credited with helping to end the insurgency in much of  we do n't think it s a systemic problem , said col jeffrey kulmayer , chief of reconciliation and engagement for the american forces in iraq , and the military s top liaison with the sons of iraq , as it calls the awakening councils but with each individual arrest the perception is there that it s an assault on the entire program in addition to the 15 awakening leaders arrested in recent weeks , the military is tracking the cases of five others who are the subjects of arrest warrants american generals are so concerned about awakening councils that colonel kulmayer says he reports to them daily on problems the groups are having , including delayed salary payments the late payrolls have been cleared up in most areas , he said , the one exception being diyala province we 're going to track very carefully that the right thing is being done , that the good guy is not being arrested but that the bad ones are , he said the military is determined to intervene if necessary , colonel kulmayer said , and has already in the case of a prominent council leader in baghdad , col raad ali of the ghazaliya neighborhood , a onetime stronghold of al qaeda it turns out the charges were trumped up , colonel kulmayer said officials persuaded a judge to dismiss the case and release him , the colonel said the number of arrests is small relative to the total number of awakening leaders , he said of the 323 leaders in baghdad , eight have been detained of the 275 leaders in diyala and salahuddin , seven have been detained , he said in addition to the leaders , at least 164 rankandfile awakening members , and as many as 200 , have been arrested , he said in addition to the delays in paying salaries , a budget crisis brought on by the plunge in oil prices has made it hard for the government to make good on its promise of jobs for awakening members these developments have in the government s intentions , which they said could send some in the movement back to the insurgency i think all these things happened at the same time and made it look bad , colonel kulmayer said but he insisted that prime minister nuri kamal almaliki and top levels of the iraqi government remained committed to financing the program and integrating its members into permanent ministry jobs , which pay substantially more than the roughly 300amonth stipend earned by awakening members the problem lies mainly with the process of issuing arrest warrants under iraqi law , a warrant requires only two witnesses , and records are not centralized , colonel kulmayer said , so charges can easily be fabricated those doing so , he said , are factions in the country that are trying to undermine the reconciliation he identified those factions as shiite extremists and al qaeda in mesopotamia , which american intelligence has found to be a homegrown sunni militant group with some foreign leadership the american military initially sponsored most of the awakening councils but has been handing responsibility for managing and paying them to the iraqi government with the promise that members will be hired into permanent government jobs however , with the exception of 4 , 291 police officers , none of the 94 , 000 awakening members have been given government positions american generals held discussions with senior iraqi government officials in recent days and won a renewed commitment to hire the awakening members in government jobs , said colonel kulmayer , citing a resolution issued tuesday by the council of ministers , the iraqi cabinet that s new and that s important , because before it was just concept , and now we 've moved from concept to implementation , colonel kulmayer said he added , however , that he had not yet seen the text of the resolution the secretary of the council of ministers , ali alallaq , said it had decided to employ the awakening members in the ministries , but still needed to discuss the details other military officials who work on awakening issues say they have yet to be convinced that the shiiteled government is any more likely now than in the past to produce jobs for the largely sunni awakening members even if the men are transferred to ministries , they say , that does not guarantee they will keep their jobs after money for the awakening program runs out later this year in the end , maybe it will work out , but there are difficulties we are not dealing with yet , said one military official , who was not authorized to speak to the news media the recent surge in violence continued wednesday when a parked car full of explosives blew up in kirkuk , killing 13 people and wounding 22 , according to the kirkuk police operations commander , yazgar shakoor the victims were mostly security guards at an oil installation
sibiu , romania klaus johannis , the successful mayor of this transylvanian city , finds himself at the center of the bitterly fought presidential election here , even though he is not running for office and is not even ethnically romanian the fact that mr johannis comes from the country s tiny german minority , which would be a major liability in other countries in eastern europe , puts him at a distinct advantage here in so much so , in fact , that should the social democratic challenger , , succeed in his bid to unseat the incumbent centerright president , traian basescu , in sunday s vote he is leading in the polls he has promised to appoint mr johannis as prime minister mr geoana s decision to back mr johannis for prime minister as one of his campaign promises hinges on the mayor s success in rebuilding into a small gem that was named a european capital of culture in 2007 while attracting foreign investments and thousands of jobs to this unlikely corner of the continent but mr johannis also benefits from the positive stereotypes romanians associate with the german population , known as , who have called the region home since the 12th century the saxons , known in german as siebenb rger sachsen , are considered hardworking , precise and uncompromising , an attractive mixture in a country tired of mismanagement and , and one of the hardest hit in europe by the economic crisis it also does not hurt that the country experienced some of its best moments under german kings more than a century ago , even though the monarchs were unrelated to the local german population i think it s a real advantage that he s german , said bianca florea , 18 , a student , as she passed through the main town square in sibiu on friday well , not exactly german , but saxon asked why , ms florea responded , we romanians are a bit lazy , that s my opinion but like most of the dozen residents interviewed here , she was skeptical about mr johannis s prospective move to bucharest , despite praising his work as mayor he could go there and do a good job for a while or he could be a puppet for others , ms florea said mr johannis belongs to none of the major parties , but instead to the small german democratic forum , which represents the 60 , 000 ethnic germans remaining in the country hundreds of thousands of others left during the oppressive regime of nicolae ceausescu and in the years immediately after the fall of communism 20 years ago political analysts in bucharest say that for all mr johannis s successes managing sibiu , working as a figurehead leader in the capital at the whim of hardnosed political operators would be another story it s a highrisk business because i would be an independent prime minister running a political government , mr johannis said in an interview in his office overlooking the town square on friday nobody s tried this before but i'm pretty optimistic it would be a success few question his success in sibiu , or hermannstadt in german local residents like to joke that his vote tallies for his reelection bids in 2004 \( 87 percent \) and 2008 \( 83 percent \) , look like rigged elections under communism and that comes despite the fact that ethnic germans represent just 2 , 000 of the city s 155 , 000 people mr johannis , who is fluent in english as well as german and romanian , traveled the continent drumming up interest in the city , helping to attract major companies like renault and siemens but he built his reputation among voters by building roads and bringing heating to onceunheated schools in town , and for showing up personally for spotchecks at municipal offices and building sites , a form of handson management that he conceded in the interview would be impossible on a national scale it s one thing to change a city and run it , mr johannis said it s a whole different business to change a country and run it but i think in the end , the abilities that a public manager needs are the same in a mayor as in a prime minister romanians appear ready to take a gamble , in part because they find themselves in such a difficult spot the international monetary fund forecast an 85 percent contraction in the country s economy for 2009 , and along with the european union and other institutions , it put together a 30 billion bailout for the country earlier this year but that sorely needed money is at risk unless the government can make difficult changes instead , this past autumn saw turmoil , infighting and in a noconfidence vote in october a poisonous presidential campaign fought more over personal issues than substantive policy has only increased the public s desire for a new face , preferably a german one we used to have a german dynasty , which created the modern romanian state , said sorin ionita , research director of the romanian academic society in bucharest who was born in what is now southern , ruled for nearly 50 years , through the turn of the last century , a golden age for romania the germans today , they benefit from this image in romania , mr ionita said but the germans suffered under the ceausescu dictatorship , a period that received renewed attention this year when , an ethnic german born and raised in romania , was awarded the for literature for her novels about that time mr ceausescu literally sold ethnic germans to the west german government for hard currency , several thousand dollars worth for each of them , in return allowing roughly 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 of them to emigrate each year from 1978 to 1989 it was no wonder that many of the transylvanian saxons chose to leave after the iron curtain fell , including mr johannis s parents , even though local romanians demonstrated in the streets for them to stay , recalled paul philippi , 86 , the honorary chairman of the german democratic forum the exodus reduced a population that once numbered some 800 , 000 to the small group of mostly elderly people who remain today romanian children now make up 90 percent of the classes at germanlanguage schools , according to the german democratic forum , seeing better economic prospects if they can learn the language of the dwindling group that built the city but right now , it is the departure of just one german that is on the minds of local citizens , their beloved mayor , who few say they want to lose to national politics i would like him to stay for us , said aurelia badila , 58 , an accountant , but for him it is a promotion , and it could be good for romania
last thursday , a jury in denver ruled that the termination of activistteacher ward churchill by the university of colorado had been wrongful \( a term of art \) even though a committee of his faculty peers had found him guilty of a variety of sins the verdict did not surprise me because i had read the committee s report and found it less an indictment of churchill than an example of a perfectly ordinary squabble about research methods and the handling of evidence the accusations that fill its pages are the kind scholars regularly hurl at their polemical opponents it s part of the game but in most cases , after you ve trashed the guy s work in a book or a review , you don t get to fire him which is good , because if the standards for dismissal adopted by the churchill committee were generally in force , hardly any of us professors would have jobs at least two reviewers of my 2001 book how milton works declared that my reading of paradise lost rests on an unproven assumption that milton repeatedly and designedly punned on the homonyms raised \( elevated \) , razed \( destroyed \) and rased \( erased \) i was accused of having fabricated these puns out of thin air and of building on the fabrication an interpretive house of cards that fell apart at the slightest touch of rationality and evidence i use the criticism of my own work as an example because to talk about the many others who have been accused of incompetence , ignorance , falsification , plagiarism and worse would be bad form and it wouldn t prove anything much except that when academics assess one another they routinely say things like , professor a obviously has not read the primary sources professor b draws conclusions the evidence does not support professor c engages in fanciful speculations and then pretends to build a solid case he s just making it up professor d does not acknowledge that he stole his argument from professor e who was his teacher \( or his student \) the scholars who are the objects of these strictures do not seem to suffer much on account of them , in part because they can almost always point to positive reviews on the other side , in part because harsh and even scabrous judgments are understood to be more or less par for the course and i won t even go into the roster of bigtime historians who in recent years have been charged with \( and in some instances confessed to \) plagiarism , distortion and downright lying with the exception of one , these academic malfeasants are still plying their trades , receiving awards and even pontificating on television why , given these examples of crimes or errors apparently forgiven , did ward churchill lose his job \( he may now regain it \) when all he was accused of was playing fast and loose with the facts , fudging his sources and going from a to d in his arguments without bothering to stop at b and c \? in short , standard stuff the answer churchill s partisans would give \( and in the end it may be the right answer \) is politics after all , they say , there wouldn t have been any special investigative committee poring over churchill s 12 singleauthor books , many edited collections and 100plus articles had he not published an internet essay on sept 12 , 2001 , saying that the attacks on the world trade towers and the pentagon were instances of the chickens coming home to roost and that those who worked and died in the towers were willing agents of the united states global empire and its malign policies and could therefore be thought of as little eichmanns these incendiary remarks were not widely broadcast until four years later , when bill o reilly and other conservative commentators brought them to the public s attention the reaction was immediate bill owens , governor of colorado , called university president elizabeth hoffman and ordered her to fire churchill she replied , you know i can t do that \( not long after , she was forced to resign \) the reason she couldn t do it is simple a public employee cannot be fired for extramural speech of which the government \( in this case gov owens \) disapproves it s unconstitutional a public employee can be fired , however , for activities that indicate unfitness for the position he or she holds and after flirting with the idea of a buyout , the university , aware that questions had been raised about churchill s scholarship , appointed a committee to review and assess his work , no doubt in the hope that something appropriately damning would be found it was , or so the committee said it found inaccuracies in churchill s account of the general allotment act of 1887 , a piece of legislation generally considered to be a part of an extended effort to weaken the force of native american culture in his discussion of the act , churchill described it as a eugenics code that uses the indian blood quantum requirement to achieve its end but there is no mention of any blood quantum requirement in the text indeed , the act contained no definition of indian whatsoever but then , after having established what could possibly be classified as a misrepresentation , the committee turned back in churchill s direction , and allowed that while the blood quantum requirement was not expressly stated , there was some force to churchill s contention that it is somehow implied in this respect , the committee continued , there is more truth to part of professor churchill s claim than his critics are prepared to credit still churchill , the committee went on to say , was factually wrong when he says of the act that it introduced for the first time the federal imposition of racial indian ancestry as a device designed to force assimilation that happened , the committee reported , 40 years earlier so that while churchill gets the general point correct , he gets the historical details wrong moreover , when his errors were pointed out by another researcher in the field , churchill simply ceased making the erroneous claims and offered no public retraction or correction the conclusion \? professor churchill deliberately embellished his broad , and otherwise accurate or , at least reasonable , historic claims regarding the allotment act of 1887 with details for which he offered no reliable independent support that s it \? he didn t verify some details and he didn t denounce himself \? there must be something else and there is churchill , the committee noted , argues that the us army , among others , intentionally introduced the smallpox virus to native american tribes , and he claims also that circumstantial evidence implicates john smith \( of pocahontas fame \) in this outrage the committee found that with respect to smith , churchill did not connect the dots in his proposed set of circumstantial evidence as for the allegation that that the army spread smallpox by knowingly distributing infected blankets , the committee found no support in written records , but notes that native american oral traditions rehearse and pass down this story , which has at least one documented source in british general jeffrey amherst s suggestion in 1763 that infected blankets be given to hostile indians the conclusion \? we do not find academic misconduct with respect to his general claim that the us army deliberately spread smallpox in addition , the committee acknowledges that early accounts of what was said by indians involved in that situation and certain native oral traditions provide some basis for churchill s interpretation in short , it seems for an instant that churchill is going to be declared \( relatively \) innocent of the most serious charges against him but after noting that he cited sources that do not support his argument and failed to document his assertion that up to 400 , 000 indians died in the smallpox epidemic , the committee turned severe and declared , we therefore find by a preponderance of the evidence a pattern of deliberate academic misconduct involving falsification , fabrication , and serious deviation from accepted practices on the evidence of its own account the committee does not seem to have earned its therefore the question of accepted practices is raised again in a particularly focused form when the committee considers the issue of churchill s ghostwriting on several occasions churchill wrote essays to which others put their names and then , at a later date , he cited those essays in support of an argument he was making the committee decided that a charge of plagiarism could not be sustained since it is not plagiarism to cite ones own work \( even if it bears another s name \) that does not dispose of the issue , however , because in the committee s view ghostwriting is itself a form of misconduct that fails to comply with established practices and deceives readers into thinking that an author has independent authority for his assertions , when in reality the only authority he has is his own churchill s response came in two parts first he pointed out that university regulations \( colorado s or anyone else s \) do not contain guidelines relating to ghostwriting there seems , therefore , to be no established practice for him to violate second , he challenged the assertion that a text he wrote cannot be properly cited as independent support for something he is writing in the present he argued \( during the committee hearing and in works and days , 2009 \) that what ghostwriters do in the academy and elsewhere is give voice to the views and conclusions of others all the ghostwriter does is supply the prose the ideas and contentions belong to the third party , who , if she did not agree to own the sentiments , would decline to affix her name to them thus when the ghostwriter subsequently cites to the text of which he has been merely the midwife , he is citing not to himself but to the person to whose ideas he gave expression it follows that ghostwriters are under no obligation to attribute authorship to themselves when quoting citing material they ve ghostwritten well , that s a little tricky , but it is an argument , and one that committee members , no doubt , would have a response to but all that means is that there would be another round of the academic backandforth one finds in innumerable , books , essays , symposiums , panel discussions all of which are routinely marked by accusations of shoddy practices and distortions of evidence , but none of which is marked by the demand that the person on the other side of the question from you be fired and drummed out of the academy there is , as i think i ve shown , a disconnect in the report between its often nuanced considerations of the questions raised in and by churchill s work , and the conclusion , announced in a parody of a judicial verdict , that he has committed crimes worthy of dismissal , if not of flogging it is almost as if the committee members were going along happily doing what they usually do in their academic work considering , parsing and evaluating arguments and then suddenly remembering that they were there for another purpose to which they hastily turn oh , yes , we re supposed to judge him let s say he s guilty i can easily imagine the entire affair being made into a teaching aid a casebook containing churchill s little eichmanns essay , the responses to it by politicians , columnists and fellow academics , assessments of churchill s other writings by friends and foes , the investigative committee s report , responses to the report \( one group of academics led by eric cheyfitz , a chaired professor at cornell , has formally charged the committee itself with research misconduct \) , the trial record , the verdict , reactions to the verdict , etc you could teach a whole course probably more than one from such a compilation and one of the questions raised in such a course would be the question i have been asking how did a gardenvariety academic quarrel about sources , evidence and documentation complete with a lot of huffing and puffing by everyone get elevated first into a review of the entire life of a tenured academic and then into a court case when that academic was terminated how and why did it get that far \? i said earlier that the answer churchill partisans would give is politics it is also the answer the jury gave it was the jury s task to determine whether churchill s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements in the ordinary academic course of things would his writings have been subject to the extended and minute scrutiny that led to the committee s recommendations \? had the governor not called hoffman , had state representatives not appeared on tv to call for churchill s head , had commentators all over the country not vilified churchill for his 9 11 views , would any of this have happened \? the answer seems obvious to me and it has now been given authoritative form in the jury s verdict let me add \( i hope it would be unnecessary \) that nothing i have said should be taken either as a judgment \( positive or negative \) on churchill s work or as a questioning of the committee s motives i am not competent to judge churchill s writings and i express no view of them and i have no doubts at all about the integrity of the committee members they just got caught up in a circus that should have never come to town
asking for understanding from his fans , business partners and fellow competitors on the pga tour , announced friday that he would take an indefinite break from professional golf to try to rebuild his personal life woods , the topranked golfer in the world , has not been seen in public since crashing his suv into a neighbor s tree in an early morning accident on nov 27 he has spent the last two weeks in his orlando , fla , area home , recovering from injuries and hearing a flood of reports of marital infidelities linking him to multiple women that has swamped the worldwide airwaves by abandoning the tour for an unspecified time , woods leaves golf without its no 1 draw , television without its no 1 ratings driver and from the golfer who makes more than 100 million a year selling their products and building their brands it was not clear how he arrived at this decision or whether it was made in consultation with corporate sponsors or pga tour officials the tour s official response was swift and supportive we fully support tiger s decision to step away from competitive golf to focus on his family his priorities are where they need to be , and we will continue to respect and honor his family s request for privacy we look forward to tiger s return to the pga tour when he determines the time is right for him woods s statement appeared on his web site just before 7 pm friday , late in the news cycle and at the start of the weekend , a time often reserved for releasing controversial news in the hopes of diminishing its impact the reaction from cbs and nbc , the two networks that will televise the bulk of the pga tour schedule when it resumes with the sbs championship at kapalua , hawaii , on january 710 , 2010 , also closely followed woods s statement sean mcmanus , the president of cbs sports and news , said golf could go on without woods , but not for long without consequences we 've obviously done golf tournaments without tiger before , mcmanus said , but we all know how much better they do when tiger is playing well on the weekend we 'll adjust , but i guess a lot of it depends on what the definition of the word indefinite' is asked whether there was a tradeoff between woods s absence and the news media circus that would accompany his return , mcmanus said i'm not as concerned about missing the circus as i am about missing him on the golf course when he was injured a year ago , we did n't have him in the pga championship golf is still a strong sport and we look forward to his return on the golf tour we 'll adjust and life will go on , but a tournament with tiger woods is a much bigger sport in his third statement since the accident drove him into seclusion , woods used his site to reiterate and amplify his profound apologies for the fallout from the reported multiple affairs to which he had alluded but had not admitted i am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people , most of all my wife and children , woods said i want to say again to everyone that i am profoundly sorry and that i ask forgiveness it may not be possible to repair the damage i 've done , but i want to do my best to try i would like to ask everyone , including my fans , the good people at my foundation , business partners , the pga tour , and my fellow competitors , for their understanding what s most important now is that my family has the time , privacy , and safe haven we will need for personal healing after much soul searching , i have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf , the statement continued i need to focus my attention on being a better husband , father , and person woods and his wife , elin , have been married for five years and have a 2yearold daughter and a 10monthold son dick ebersol , the chairman of nbc universal sports , issued a brief statement of support it s a wonderful course of action , ebersol said , and i hope everyone will give them the peace to do the best thing for the family woods s decision to take the break for an indeterminate period will most likely shift the focus of speculation away from the almost daily updates on his dalliances to what date he will return to the sport he has dominated since 1997 his recent pattern has been to skip the season opener in maui and the sony hawaiian open and begin his united states schedule at the san diego open at torrey pines golf course at the end of january that event is scheduled for jan 2831 in 2010 from there , to begin his runup to the first major championship of the season at the , woods would normally play in the wgcaccenture world match play \( feb 1821 \) , the wgcca championship at doral \( march 1114 \) and the arnold palmer invitational at bay hill \( march 2528 \) his next event would be the masters , at augusta , ga , april 811 under normal circumstances , the odds on a healthy woods missing the year s first major championship would be astronomical but the circumstances since the car accident have been anything but normal woods s suspected marital indiscretions have been the no 1 topic on every outlet from internet postings to tabloid magazines at grocery checkouts to reports in the mainstream news media one no 1ranked golfer who has been through his share of domestic upheaval voiced his support on friday i feel sorry for tiger , greg norman told the golf channel in naples , fla , at his tournament , the shark shootout but he s got to figure out his situation for himself personally from the game of golf , i'm sure we 'd like to see him back out there performing to the level he has played he s been a great asset to the game and he 'll continue to be that way from a personal perspective , i wish him well i hope he sorts it out family is family and nobody likes to be in that position bloomberg news reported that woods s image was taken down friday from the homepage of the web site for accenture plc , the consulting company that has used him in its marketing since 2003 nike , another woods sponsor , issued a release that said tiger has been part of nike for more than a decade he is the best golfer in the world and one of the greatest athletes of his era we look forward to his return to golf he and his family have nike s full support there were no immediate reactions from woods s other sponsors , including att , gillette , tag heuer watches and gatorade woods s foundation is another area of vulnerability because of its focus on helping build character in youth woods issued a separate statement about the foundation since my dad and i created the foundation , this work has been extremely important to me , it said i know my staff will continue these efforts during my absence before the events of nov 27 , expectation had been building for the 2010 season woods won six tournaments in 2009 , none of them majors next year was looked upon as another opportunity to add to his total of 14 majors and resume his chase of jack nicklaus s record total of 18 but that quest has been put off as woods attempts to sort out the damage done to his marriage he finished his web site message with another plea for his family to be left alone as he and his wife work to reconcile again , i ask for privacy for my family , he wrote , and i am especially grateful for all those who have offered compassion and concern during this difficult period
nazarabad , pakistan the fighting is over and the villagers have returned , but life here remains suspended villagers' buffaloes are gone , and their harvests are spoiled power is still out in many areas schools , blown up by the , lay in heaps even the bricks have been sold we are orphans , said akbar khan , a school principal no one has come to ask about us this is the upper , ground zero for the taliban in northern while urban areas farther south are bustling and back to life , the real test of pakistan s fight against the taliban in swat will take place here , in the impoverished villages where the militant movement began but more than two months after the end of active combat , with winter fast approaching , reconstruction has yet to begin , and little has been accomplished on the ground to win back people s trust , villagers and local officials say the lag , they argue , is risky it was a sense of neartotal abandonment by the government that opened people to the taliban to begin with , they say , and the longer people are left to fend for themselves , the greater the chance of a relapse i'm really worried , said javed iqbal , the chief secretary of the northwest frontier province , where swat is located we do not have the luxury of time if you do n't start showing something more tangible , he continued , i would n't be surprised to see the state of anarchy returning pakistan s government says it is tending to the needs of the people of swat , an aid effort that was estimated last month to require 12 billion the country s largest donor , the united states , is about to pump billions of dollars of aid into pakistan , and there have been international conferences to gather funds but money for reconstruction in this battered area is still almost nonexistent , officials say , and aid organizations , encumbered by security rules , have been slow to respond the government thinks people are slowly getting back to normal lives , said pervez tahir , chairman of the economics department at in lahore the reality is , the poor were ignored before , and the poor are ignored after that pattern has been borne out for much of pakistan s troubled 62year history , and is particularly severe here even before the war , things in nazarabad were broken villagers made donations to replace a coil in the town s aging electric transformer there was no running water or indoor plumbing , and teachers chipped in for a water pump for the school with no one important to lobby for it , the village was left to fend for itself so when the taliban first surfaced , in the form of fm radio broadcasts by a cleric who talked about how people s needs had been ignored , many here saw salvation the level of deprivation was unbearable , said muhammad shah hussein , a teacher in nazarabad when the taliban came , there was a sense of hope but as time went on , the taliban s tactics became more coercive , and sympathy evaporated when the group blew up the village s schools we told them , the people are so poor and weak , please do n't destroy this school , ' said akbar khan , the principal but that was of no use now students sit on small stacks of bricks , perched like birds in a strange new outdoor classroom the girls here still do not go to school at all their school was never rebuilt after it was destroyed , and local custom frowns on their being out in the open about 20 percent of all schools in the swat valley are destroyed or unusable , according to figures provided by the united nations children s fund , unicef so far , the main aid response here has been the distribution of tents unicef , which is leading that effort , says it has had a slow response from donors , receiving about 60 percent of the money it asked for and after taliban attacks killed seven united nations employees , including their director of education , reconstruction has been put on hold in the waraffected areas tired of waiting , mr iqbal took financing from other areas in his province to rebuild 65 schools in swat the united states , which has earmarked 20 million for school reconstruction in the area , last month pledged hundreds of millions of dollars for social development but shakeel qadr khan , the provincial official in charge of reconstruction , said it was not clear how much , if any , of that would go to rebuilding swat the years of taliban rule and a summer of military operations have taken their toll on farming , too khazwar , a farmer from the village of guelarai , said his wheat crop spoiled and his fruit was never picked , leaving him without money for seed and fertilizer the secretary of agriculture for the province estimated that it would cost as much as 800 million to help farmers get back on their feet all of swat is suffering from this , said mr khazwar , who like many rural pakistanis uses one name the military offensive here did not cause mass destruction or large numbers of civilian deaths , as it had in past campaigns , and the army now has bases all over the valley the military presence has been welcomed by an overwhelming majority in mingora , who felt before that they had been abandoned to the militants but in the villages where militants were strong as early as 2003 , people have now come to fear the military , too , making getting back to normal even harder mr hussein estimated that more than half of his male students were not coming to school because they were afraid the military would arrest them for taliban involvement he is also nervous about sticking out , now that he has assumed the role of spokesman for families , mostly illiterate , asking about relatives who are in military custody the one task that is proceeding at a rapid pace is the establishment of local militias jamal nasir khan , a political leader near here , is recruiting hundreds of men in villages in the upper valley to defend against the taliban mr khan , who fled to the capital , islamabad , in 2007 and returned late this summer , argues that security should come first people want normalization in a month it wo n't happen , said mr khan , who puts on americanstyle army boots , a flak jacket and an m16 rifle anytime he leaves his house it s not like a genie will come to make things better mr khan depends entirely on the military he is driven in military vehicles his food is cooked by the army and he is practically alone in the area none of the seven district officials who used to run the area have come back few high school teachers or doctors have returned illiteracy makes villagers easy to ignore taja bibi , a villager who cannot read , but whose bright 12yearold daughter , rabihat , aches to return to school , said she had not even bothered to ask when it might reopen we ca n't argue , and we ca n't respond , she said , sitting on a dirt floor in a small house that is home to more than 20 people they do n't consider us worth talking to for mr hussein , creating an educated class that knows its rights is the only hope for change in pakistan but that requires schools , and the ones in his village are gone we are the losers , he said
john burns , the times s chief foreign correspondent , has been taking questions regularly from readers of at war here , he answers a question from a reader about friday s in the context of the newly revised rules of engagement issued by gen stanley a mcchrystal , the top commander of american forces in afghanistan when a country s war fighting strategy is by definition death from a safe distance , killing civilians is deemed to be an acceptable part of the strategy and the deliberate killing of civilians is considered to be a crime against humanity tom there s no denying that the use of american and other allied airpower in afghanistan , as in iraq , has been a major contributor to civilian casualties , and the kunduz attack on friday , with reports that 80 to 90 people may have been killed , is one in a succession of strikes over the past year or so that have had the potential for seriously undermining afghan support for the coalition yet the fact that this happened barely three months after gen stanley a mcchrystal issued new guidelines severely restricting airstrikes and warning that their irresponsible use contains the seeds of our own destruction seems to demonstrate how difficult it will be in practice to walk back from a form of firepower that is the trump card of a modern military force faced with an elusive insurgency this is all the more so for the fact that coalition airpower in afghanistan , as in iraq , has relied almost exclusively on smart bombs and missiles that are deadly accurate and , because they are fired from distance , and sometimes from over the horizon , minimize the risks to the aircrew of groundfire the fatal concomitant literally is that the technology distances the fire controllers , whether pilots or weapons officers aboard aircraft and helicopters , or computer warriors thousands of miles away at a base outside las vegas unleashing hellfire missiles from predator drones , from the reality that in hitting a legitimate military target , as in kunduz , they may unwittingly kill civilians it is not much comfort to say that in the history of warfare this is nothing new from the time of the ancient greeks and romans to the crusaders and beyond , standoff weapons were the force multipliers of their time , whether they were siege engines firing cannonballs made of stone or arrows with their tips steeped in flaming tar finding ways to kill the enemy while sparing your own is fundamental to the art of war but distance from a target is a key differentiator the further from the target , the greater the risk of killing innocents as a brit , i can t forget that the royal air force killed vast numbers of civilians some estimates run as high as a million dead , and more with area bombing of german cities in world war two between 1942 and 1945 that winston churchill and his bomber command chief , marshal of the royal air force sir arthur bomber harris , devised as a means of crushing the morale of the german population and speeding the end of the war that , of course , remains hugely controversial even today in the current wars , i think we can be sure , there has been no deliberate allied targeting of civilians with airstrikes , but more than in most wars america has fought , there is the pervasive risk of bad or tainted intelligence , since much of the targeting is based on information relayed from local allies who may have ends alien to america s in calling in airstrikes , from settling old tribal grievances to personal disputes certainly , that s what dexter filkins of the times and i concluded in the winter and spring of 20012002 , when we set out to visit a dozen or more villages hit by american airstrikes in the weeks after the taliban fled kabul and found in many of them that those killed from a handful here , to dozens there appeared to have been noncombatants fuller details of the kunduz airstrike will take some time to emerge , if they ever do , but early reports that the taliban hijackers of the fuel trucks may have allowed or encouraged local civilians to gather around the trucks to siphon fuel suggest that that the men who seized the trucks may have been careless at best , cynical at worst , in allowing civilians to put themselves at fatal risk by assembling around a potential military target this , too , is another ugly feature of the afghan fighting , as it has been in iraq an insurgency that recognizes the propaganda value of america killing innocents , and doesn t care greatly , if at all , about the carnage that ensues none of which excuses the careless use of airstrikes , as general mcchrystal , from a reading of the new rules he set down in june , would surely agree but the history of warfare suggests that there is ultimately another deadly calculus for allied commanders who are now under duress to use airstrikes only as a last resort inevitably , that will mean using other , less remote means to engage the enemy , foreswearing some of the protection lent by the distance from which modern airborne weapons are fired , and , just as inevitably , incurring casualties on the allied side that might otherwise have been avoided
baltimore knows how to win a race with a filly he did it in 1988 with winning colors , he also knows something about how to stop one from winning a triple crown race in 1980 , his chestnut colt codex pushed around the derby heroine genuine risk to win the  lukas , a hall of fame trainer , would like to do the same to rachel alexandra on saturday in the middle jewel of the triple crown , but he is not confident that he will he says he doubts that his two colts , the long shots luv gov and flying private , have what it takes to beat rachel alexandra in the preakness he is not sure anyone does i think this filly is exceptional , lukas said if you can get her at 2to1 , she s the best bet of the day we all have to beat her it s a matter of the boys getting in there with her and seeing how they match up it is hard to find anyone who disagrees with lukas when the field of 13 goes to the gate early saturday evening , rachel alexandra will be leading the way at 85 in the morning line , she should be the solid betting favorite and will be the sentimental choice for fans pulling for a filly to win still , she will have to defeat , which includes the winner pioneerof the nile , the derby runnerup and the winner of three consecutive stakes races this year friesan fire , the louisiana derby winner and big drama , who has not been outrun in six straight races another problem for rachel alexandra could be the condition of the track forecasters say a severe thunderstorm may hit the area in the late afternoon she did win her lone career start in the slop , but wet tracks can cause unpredictable results in all , 110 fillies have run in a triple crown race , and only 10 have pulled off a victory winning colors is one of three fillies to win the kentucky derby four fillies have won the preakness , but none since 1924 when rags to riches won the 2007 belmont , she was the first filly to win that race in 102 years lukas says he believes that most of the fillies that have had success in triple crown races have certain traits in common rachel alexandra , he says , has every one of them you have to have a filly that is exceptional within her own class , lukas said against her own gender , is she extraordinary \? she ca n't be just another good filly secondly , she has to have a running style that would put her in a high cruising speed where she can stay up close early they ca n't come from left field i 've tried that with a few different fillies and it does n't seem to work then you look at their pedigrees and have to see that they have the breeding to go a mile and a quarter or , in the case of the preakness , a mile and threesixteenths lastly , you look around and see if there is a secretariat , a seattle slew or a spectacular bid in the race if you do n't have one of those and , instead , have five or six evenly matched horses , then you know you can win it lukas said that codex , at the time of the 1980 preakness , was the type of imposing male that a filly could not handle unable to run in the kentucky derby because he was not nominated , codex came into the preakness off wins in the santa anita and hollywood derbies and was primed for a careerbest effort his victory , though , was among the more controversial in racing history with angel cordero jr aboard , codex pushed genuine risk to the middle of the track on the far turn and many genuine risk fans thought that amounted to bullying the owners bert and diana firestone unsuccessfully appealed to the maryland racing commission to have codex disqualified when i came to the track the next morning , there was a sack full of telegrams waiting for me , lukas recalled i thought , is n't this nice , people are writing to congratulate me' it was hate mail but lukas said that he did not think there was an equal to codex in this race , and that he would have run rachel alexandra in the derby bob baffert agrees i would have taken a shot at the derby with her , baffert said there was n't a lot of speed in there i saw her work the monday before the derby she was incredible i watched all the derby horses work and i said , man , i'm glad she s not in the derby' she s a tremendous athlete baffert , who will try to beat rachel alexandra with the kentucky derby runnerup pioneerof the nile , is the last trainer to have run a filly in the preakness he finished last in 1999 with excellent meeting , who was pulled up before crossing the wire rachel alexandra did not start in the derby because her previous owner , dolphus morrison , does not like to run fillies against males and did not make her eligible for the triple crown the situation changed when jess jackson bought her from morrison after the kentucky oaks and paid 100 , 000 to supplement her into the preakness he is not apprehensive about his new star taking on males the essence of this horse is that she is capable of doing this , and she has the strength and endurance to make it work , jackson said you always worry about fillies , but the champion of japan last year was a filly their horse of the year was a filly who won the arc de triomphe \?

richard v burkhauser , a public policy professor , explains how the disability system would be improved if it followed the welfare reform model tim moore , a former disability claims examiner in north carolina joins this discussion the 2010 budget unveiled on thursday by the obama administration estimates that the government can generate huge savings if it devotes more resources to eliminating fraud , abuse and waste in medicare , medicaid and the social security disability insurance program in the social security program alone , the white house proposes to spend 43 billion over five years to fight fraud associated with disability claims a problem , officials say , that stems from lack of oversight federal spending on disability insurance leaped 65 percent from 2001 to 2007 , yet the number of full medical reviews , one type of review for evaluating claims for eligibility for continuing disability payments , fell from 840 , 000 in 2001 to 190 , 000 in 2007 , according to the social security administration , as the wall street journal reported this week why have federal disability costs skyrocketed \? is it because of fraud , an increase in the number of the truly disabled , or are there larger problems with the program \? , an associate professor of political science at the university of richmond , is the author of disability rights and the american social safety net before we go looking for miscreants cheating the disability programs , it is important to realize that the growth in the supplemental security income and disability insurance programs is perfectly understandable given bipartisan policy changes made two decades ago and current limits on what the social security administration can do to ferret out fraud between 1984 and 1990 , congress and the ssa loosened the disability requirements , especially for children and people suffering from mental disorders the agency also agreed that it would no longer cut off recipients it thought were no longer disabled unless it could show that their medical condition had improved , something that is exceedingly difficult to do as part of welfare reform in 1996 , republicans in congress did manage to tighten disability standards somewhat however , none of those changes substantially rolled back the loosening of the disability criteria that had occurred as a result , it should come as no surprise that , compared to two decades ago , it is much easier today for younger adults and children , particularly those with mental disorders , to receive disability benefits and to stay on the disability rolls longer once found eligible at the same time , current state efforts to trim budgets will make it difficult for president obama to achieve the cost savings he seeks in an effort to save money , some states are laying off the disability examiners that the ssa uses to process claims , leading to a huge backlog in applications because these same state disability examiners also conduct the ssa s continuing reviews of disability , this cutback compromises the agency s ability to maintain program integrity as the recession wears on and more people apply and fewer people are reexamined , disability rolls can be expected to grow however , the villain here is not fraud instead , program growth is the result of intentional changes to policy and administrative capacity is the sarah gibson blanding professor of public policy in the department of policy analysis at cornell he is coauthor , with mary daly , of the forthcoming book the declining work and welfare of people with disabilities what went wrong and a strategy for change the caseloads and total expenditures of the two major federal transfers programs targeted on that portion of the disabled population that is unable to work social security disability insurance and supplemental security income for disabled adults and the families of disabled children have nearly doubled in size \( 13 million people in 2008 \) and program costs \( 135 billion in 2008 \) since 1993 this program growth was not caused by a deterioration in the health of the working age population but by the unintended consequences of public policy while the added funds for compliance officers in president obama s proposed budget may reduce fraudulent disability claims , this will do little to reduce disability program growth president obama could be the same agent of change toward disability policies as president clinton was on welfare reform the key is recognizing that most working age people with disabilities could and would work , if work paid it took systemic reforms based on two decades of research that showed that if you made work pay , welfare mothers could and would work , rather than a crackdown on welfare fraud for president clinton to successfully change welfare as we knew it healthbased impairments can lead people to leave the work force permanently , but this need not happen incentives matter , and our current disability system encourages impaired workers , their employers and state governments to invest their time and energy in showing that impaired workers can t work rather than in the accommodation , rehabilitation and access to health care that could keep them in the labor force such a system is bad for taxpayers because it is an ineffective way to provide social protection for the minority of disabled workers who no longer can work and it is bad for benefit recipients since , like welfare mothers , their economic wellbeing would be greater if they worked , a former labor department economist , is a at the brookings institution one of the most difficult administrative tasks faced by the social security administration is distinguishing between disabled and nondisabled workers in 2006 slightly more than 2 million workers applied for disability insurance benefits about 550 , 000 applicants were found to be disabled and were awarded a benefit in that year almost the same number were initially denied benefits because they were not deemed to be medically disabled many other applicants were denied benefits for nonmedical reasons , and about 300 , 000 applicants did not receive an immediate ruling on their application many applicants who are initially denied benefits file an appeal a large percentage of these appeals are ultimately successful a little more than half of applicants ultimately receive benefits the appeals process is both timeconsuming and costly many applicants who are eventually successful in their appeals may wait for years before receiving a favorable ruling the cost of the application and appeals process stems from the inherent difficulty of determining who is too disabled to work many disabled workers are initially judged to be nondisabled , and of course some nondisabled applicants end up collecting benefits statistics published by the social security administration suggest that the standards for determining disability vary greatly from one state to the next the federal government can certainly reduce the disability rolls and the cost of the disability program by conducting more frequent and toughminded reviews of recipients disability status there will be collateral damage , however the reviews will impose real hardship on some disabled workers whose cases are reviewed it makes sense to conduct the reviews , but it would be sensible to focus reviews on workers with medical conditions that are most likely to improve resources should also be concentrated in parts of the country where statistics suggest that error rates are highest is a former disability claims examiner in north carolina , which is part of the social security administration s atlanta region he publishes a that provides information on how the system works i m a former disability examiner who worked for north carolina disability determination services fraud , from my perspective , seems to be a politically convenient target however , it occurs in a very , very small percentage of cases the disability system really faces bigger much problems than fraud for instance , the bifurcated nature of the claims processing system though the disability benefits are paid by the federal government , they are processed in a system that involves both federal and state agencies the salaries of disability examiners are paid by the federal government , but they are state employees in this recession , some states are furloughing these workers , too the impact , of course , is obvious it takes a system that is already overstressed with too many cases to process and slows it down even more for many individuals who are disabled and need help , the delay in having decisions made on their claims means bankruptcy or foreclosure another problem , as i see it , is the lack of consistency in how cases are evaluated if you take a claimant s case to two separate processing units in a state agency , you may , at times , get two different outcomes this is because there s a lot of subjective evaluation that exists in the current system there are large differences in approval rates between various states , not to mention differences between approval rates at the state agencies and later at the disability hearing level where an administrative law judge makes the decision on the claim federalizing the system and enforcing more discipline would probably help , as would better medical information training for examiners who often know little about the impairments they evaluate , like the functional limitations that result from pain is an administrative law judge in cleveland for the social security administration the views here are his own and in no way are they expressions of the social security administration as a judge who has handled social security disability cases for 16 years , i do not believe that there is as much fraud as the press and the public believe when it comes to the individuals who are making the claims for supplemental security benefits that does not imply that is no fraud i generally believe in the sincerity of what they say they are poor and the benefits they receive are now only 674 a month for an eligible individual what are these people supposed to do in this economy with the limitations they say they have \? there is too much emphasis on reputed individual fraud and not enough on how the system itself can be reformed a number of my fellow judges share my views right now , the judge wears three hats one hat is to represent the claimant , the other is to represent the government , and the third is to represent the social security trust fund i have advocated for a long time that the government needs to have its own representative in these hearings i do not advocate making the hearings adversarial , but that government attorneys act as an ombudsman , charged with the duty of getting the pertinent facts right now , it is the obligation of the judge , through this staff , to compile a full file as judges we are responsible for making sure that the record is fully developed the staff has to assist claimants , even though the claimants may have attorneys , and get all of the appropriate evidence before us the staff must call hospitals and doctors to request the appropriate evidence
secaucus , nj has struck out looking displeased , he leans on his bat , right hand on his hip , and looks back at the umpire he utters something that can only be imagined , on deck , leans on his bat , too , as if he has seen this act before ruth finally shuffles away , head turned to the umpire , dragging his bat through the dirt the scene , along with eight seconds of footage of ruth playing the outfield , was found by a new hampshire man in his grandfather s home movie collection it provides a rare look at ruth , a showman even in defeat no american sport has a past as deep and cherished as baseball s but precious little of the sport s history is preserved in moving images much occurred before the television age , leaving only grainy , scattershot clips culled from newsreels and home movies and rarely do the clips show a player of ruth s stature the newly arrived ruth film is part of the video collection of major league baseball productions , the league s official archivist , which spans more than 100 years and includes about 150 , 000 hours of moving images most of the collection is stored in plastic cases that line metal shelves of a room labeled major league baseball film and video archive the overflow is stored a few miles away in fort lee pieces of the collection receive wide circulation during baseball s postseason each fall fans will see clips sprinkled through this year s television broadcasts , including highlights of the 1959 world series \( won by the los angeles dodgers \) and dodgers manager joe torre playing for the st louis cardinals , his team s firstround opponent older clips will be seen repeatedly on commercials from the likes of pepsi and budweiser , which are corporate sponsors the latest babe ruth film , unseen publicly until now , is part of a 90second clip shot from the firstbase stands at yankee stadium there is no sound but there are sweeping views of the park and there is ruth , obvious by his shape and waddle he is shown in right field , hands on his knees , glove on his right hand to a casual fan , it appears unremarkable but it represents the archive s only game action of ruth playing in the outfield where he spent more than 2 , 200 games other than a betweeninnings game of catch nick trotta , baseball s manager of library licensing , took a look at the newly arrived ruth clip first he realized it was something he had not seen before when others saw it , it was wow , wow , wow , mr trotta said the trick with the ruth clip was to decipher when the film was shot and who else appears in it that is where major league baseball s video library turns into csi secaucus the archivists joe porciello and frank caputo yankees fans from queens and brooklyn have starring roles mr porciello , 47 , began his baseball archivist career as a teenager 29 years ago his main role is to fill the steady requests for clips , often for movies , television shows and commercials \( varying fees are charged for such commercial requests \) networks covering baseball often make lastminute requests none more than mlb network , which broadcasts from just down the hall ask mr porciello for a clip say , of the chicago white sox wearing shorts for one game in 1976 and he will have chet lemon , in shorts , on his screen moments later but to learn the names of every other player in the clip , ask mr caputo i probably know better how to find things , mr porciello said and he s better at knowing what it is he s more the rain man mr caputo , 54 , was a wall street credit analyst who hated his job but loved history in 1995 he answered a call for a sports librarian , and got the job now he mostly scrolls through forgotten film , perhaps found by a team in a ballpark closet somewhere or discovered by mr caputo himself as he scrounges through the fort lee facility a 1970sera regularseason game between the cubs and the giants was plopped into the machine to demonstrate how the video detectives work within 30 seconds they determined the game took place in 1975 the feat was even more amazing because the material was viewed on fast forward , a blur on the screen wait ! mr caputo said that blond kid might be nick swisher s father sure enough , in the dugout was steve swisher , then a 23yearold catcher on his way to journeyman status five years later , in 1980 , he became the father of nick swisher , now a member of the yankees we 'll use this for the playoffs , mr porciello said , making a mental note to pass it on to television producers it was not until 1998 , when major league baseball took over the archives from a long string of licensees , that every pitch of every game was archived now , the collection grows annually by about 10 , 000 hours by comparison , all the wellworn images of ruth hitting home runs , trotting bases , mugging for cameras fit onto an hourlong tape the latest ruth clip requires further examination to understand more about that particular game mr porciello , mr caputo and others have not investigated fully , but they believe , as does the film s donor , that it was shot in 1928 the players have no numbers on their backs the yankees began wearing them in 1929 \( most other teams started in 1932 \) gehrig took over as a starter \( famously , from wally pipp \) in 1925 advertisements in the outfield , including on the fence , match photographs from 1928 the seats are full and the shadows long , so archivists think it might be opening day or the world series the opposing team is not clear , so uniform designs will be studied and various team rosters will be examined for heights and weights of players at particular positions archivists sometimes will compare body language to other clips of the era to learn the game s exact date , archivists will look at newspaper accounts , weather reports and box scores to see when ruth struck out they know that ruth struck out in games 1 and 2 of the 1928 world series , both at yankee stadium , against the st louis cardinals whatever the final analysis , it eliminates another clip from the lengthy wish list of mr porciello and mr caputo but we still have no footage of babe pitching for the red sox , mr porciello said , referring to ruth s early years as an accomplished pitcher mr caputo turned around an argument ensued trips were made to the shelves blackandwhite images whizzed by on monitors in the end , mr porciello was right mr caputo was thinking of a clip showing ruth pitching for a barnstorming team there is no film of ruth pitching in a game for the red sox or , other than for some warmup pitches , for the yankees , either not yet , at least

washington senator s wealthy parents gave almost 100 , 000 to his former lover and her family , ostensibly out of concern for their welfare and as part of a pattern of generosity , his lawyer disclosed thursday a statement by his lawyer , paul coggins , on behalf of the mr ensign , a republican from nevada , said that in april 2008 the senator s parents each gave 12 , 000 apiece to cindy hampton , her husband , doug , and two of their children in the form of a single check for 96 , 000 the payments were made as gifts , accepted as gifts and complied with tax rules governing gifts , the statement read under federal tax regulations , 12 , 000 is the most that a person can give as a gift without having to declare or pay taxes on it but despite the assertion that the gifts were aboveboard , the latest revelation concerning mr ensign s indiscretion his first public confirmation that gifts were made to his former lover is sure to provide grist for political detractors shortly after the affair was disclosed , about three weeks ago , mr ensign resigned as the fourthranking republican leader in the senate but he has insisted that he has no plans to give up his seat i always planned on serving and working hard , working harder than i ever worked , mr ensign told the las vegas sun , which first reported the 96 , 000 payment , on thursday \( the senator s office did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on thursday afternoon \) mr ensign has said he had an affair with ms hampton , a former member of his campaign staff , from december 2007 to august 2008 thus , the payment to the hamptons would have been made while the romance was still going on \( the senator s father , mike ensign , made a fortune in the casino business \) after the senator told his parents about the affair , the statement issued by mr coggins said , his parents decided to make the gifts out of concern for the wellbeing of longtime family friends during a difficult time the gifts are consistent with a pattern of generosity by the ensign family to the hamptons and others none of the gifts came from campaign or official funds nor were they related to any campaign or official duties senator ensign has complied with all applicable laws and senate ethics rules the disclosure of the 96 , 000 gift came a day after doug hampton said on a las vegas television program that mr ensign had paid mrs hampton more than 25 , 000 in severance pay a watchdog group , citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington , called for an investigation into whether the possible payment had violated laws on the use of campaign money
forward operating base warhorse , iraq there is no mistaking that this dusty , gravelstrewn camp northeast of baghdad is anything other than a combat outpost in a stillhostile land and there is no mistaking that women in uniform have had a transformative effect on it they have their own quarters , boxy trailers called \( the military s acronym for containerized housing units , pronounced chews \) there are women s bathrooms and showers , alongside the men s married couples live together the base s clinic treats gynecological problems and has , alongside the equipment needed to treat the trauma of modern warfare , an ultrasound machine opponents of integrating women in combat zones long feared that sex would mean the end of american military prowess but now birth control is available the px at warhorse even sold out of condoms one day recently reflecting a widely accepted reality that soldiers have sex at outposts across iraq the wars in iraq and afghanistan are the first in which tens of thousands of american military women have lived , worked and fought with men for prolonged periods wars without front lines , they have done more than just muddle the rules meant to keep women out of direct enemy contact they have changed the way the united states military goes to war they have reshaped life on bases across iraq and afghanistan they have cultivated a new generation of women with a warrior s ethos and combat experience that for millennia was almost exclusively the preserve of men and they have done so without the disruption of discipline and unit cohesion that some feared would unfold at places like warhorse there was a lot of debate over where women should be , said brig gen heidi v brown , one of the two highest ranking women in iraq today , recalling the start of the war here we are six years later , and you do n't hear about it you should n't hear about it in many ways , general brown s career trajectory since the war began reflects the expanded role for women at war in 2003 , as a colonel , she commanded a patriot airdefense brigade that joined the push from kuwait to baghdad , losing nine soldiers in a maintenance battalion outside nasiriya three days after the invasion began one of them , pfc lori ann piestewa , was the first woman killed in action in iraq pfc jessica d lynch was captured in the same attack now , as the american role in the war declines , general brown will oversee the logistics of withdrawing the vast amounts of military hardware in iraq over the next year we 've needed needed the contributions of both our men and women , said brig gen mary a legere , the director of intelligence for the american war effort here and the other highest ranking woman in iraq the military , of course , is not gender blind , especially in a war zone sexual harassment in a stillpredominantly male institution remains a problem so does sexual assault both are underreported , soldiers and officers here say , because the rigidity of the military chain of command can make accusations uncomfortable and even risky for victims living in close quarters with the men they accuse as a precaution , women are advised to travel in pairs , particularly in smaller bases populated with iraqi troops and civilians capt margaret d taafemcmenamy , commander of the intelligence analysis cell at warhorse , carries a folding knife and a heavy , ridged flashlight a christmas gift from her husband , whom she lives with here as a precaution when she is out at night on the base staff sgt patricia f bradford , 27 , a psychological operations soldier , said that slights , subtle and not , were common , and some were easier to brush off than others women are still viewed derisively at times in the confined , occasionally tense space of an outpost like warhorse you 're a bitch , a slut or a dyke or you 're married , but even if you 're married , you 're still probably one of the three , sergeant bradford said at the same time , she and other female soldiers cope with the slights , showing a disarming brashness i think being a staff sergeant and a bitch helps deflect those things , she added the issues that arise in having women in combat harassment , bias , hardship , even sexual relations are , she and others said , a matter of discipline , maturity and professionalism rather than an argument for separating the sexes sergeant bradford recalled the day during her first tour when her convoy moved south while a soldier with whom she was then engaged to be married moved north on the same highway she listened on the radio as his convoy came under an attack that continued after she was out of range for four days , i had no idea what happened to him , she said , but i still had to continue my mission , because that s what you do when you 're a soldier \( he emerged unscathed , she later learned \) such issues were not foreseen when the war in iraq began in 2003 , even though the initial invasion force  on a practical level , the military was not prepared to house and otherwise address the specific needs of women in a war zone including issues like health and privacy early on , bases were largely makeshift and far more dangerous few soldiers , male or female , had more than rudimentary quarters or latrines none had much privacy sgt dawn m cloukey , a communications specialist , spent her first tour in iraq in 2005 and 2006 as the only woman among 45 soldiers , operating a retransmission station in the mountains of northern iraq and then in the center of baghdad she lived out of a rucksack , with no toilet or room of her own she described the experience as isolating i always felt like the plague , she said at warhorse , on her second tour in iraq , where she handles communications for the commander of the first stryker brigade of the 25th infantry division as the united states military settled into more permanent bases , many initial difficulties abated , as the army gradually adapted to the new reality of waging war with a mixed force so have the soldiers themselves women have sought acceptance in a stillpredominately male environment not by emphasizing their sex but rather by displaying their toughness , their willingness to adjust to conditions that are less than ideal i 've kicked my guys out of the truck to pee in a bottle like that , sgt joelene m lachance , a soldier with the 172nd military intelligence battalion , said at warhorse , pointing to one of the liter water bottles that are ubiquitous at bases in iraq cut the bottle off and pee in the bottle and then dispose of it sometimes it s an issue , but most of the time , i just make do i do n't try to , like , i ca n't sleep here , ' she continued if they 're sleeping there , i'm sleeping there i spent five days out in the truck once with six of my guys , sleeping on the floor warhorse still reverberates with the rumble of armored convoys and the thud of helicopters ferrying troops and , at times , the wounded it is just north of baquba , the regional capital of diyala province , one of the most restive provinces in iraq here , the war is not over warhorse will very likely be among the last bases to close in iraq before american troops withdraw in full at the outset of the war , the introduction of women into outposts like warhorse raised fears not just of abuse or harassment , but also of sex and pregnancy the worst of those fears , officers say , have not materialized in fact , sex in america s war zones is fairly common , soldiers say , and has not generally proved disruptive in april , the latest iteration of general order no 1 , the rules governing the behavior of soldiers in iraq broadly , quietly relaxed the explicit prohibition on sex in a war zone , though it still bars sex with iraqis and spending the night in someone else s chu some commands , including baghdad , retain broader restrictions , for example , on being in chus belonging to members of the opposite sex the chain of command already has to deal with enough , captain taafemcmenamy said they do n't really want to have to punish soldiers for dating women do become pregnant a condition that , intentional or not , in or out of wedlock , requires the woman to be flown out within two weeks , causing personnel disruptions in individual units the army and marine corps declined to say exactly how many women left iraq and afghanistan as a result of pregnancies , but it appears to be relatively rare and has had little effect on overall readiness , commanders say at warhorse , the first stryker brigade , which has thousands of soldiers , has sent only three women home because of pregnancies in 10 months in iraq , the brigade said there was a fear if we integrate units , you will have a bunch of young people with raging hormones , and it will end up in too many unwanted pregnancies , and it s more trouble than it s worth , said peter mansoor , a former battalion commander in iraq who , until retiring recently , served as gen david h petraeus s executive officer with good leadership and mentorship , we have been able to keep those problems to a minimum roughly 1 in 20 of the 5 , 600 soldiers at warhorse is female , a smaller ratio than in the military as a whole nonetheless , they are fully integrated in the base s operations many of the women at warhorse serve in jobs that have traditionally accommodated women the base hospital , food service , supply and administration others , though , serve on the brigade staff , in intelligence and psychological operations , which until recently were part of the special forces and thus off limits to women we have changed so much , col burt k thompson , the commander at warhorse , said of the army , noting that every time he leaves the base , his patrol includes two women , including sergeant cloukey on comms communications and a medic , sgt evette t leestewart to have a female on an infantry brigade staff \? oh my god like many commanders who have served in iraq or afghanistan , he said that women have ended the debate over their role by their performance i 've relieved males from command , he said i 've never relieved a female commander in two and a half years as commander the nature of the war has also done much to change the debate over combat roles any trip off the heavily secured bases now effectively invites contact with the enemy many women have also been pulled off their regular jobs and trained to search iraqi women at checkpoints because of local cultural sensitivities , putting them as much at risk as any male counterpart when specialist jennifer m hoeppner goes outside the wire at warhorse , as going on patrol is known , she clambers into what she calls the best seat in the truck , the turret atop the army s newest armored vehicle , the mrap i'm the gunner on all our missions , she said , having qualified for the m240b machine gun at an expert level i think some of the males are a little confused when i go up , specialist hoeppner said they 're like , who s your gunner \? ' women are also increasingly attached to infantry and armored units that train and advise iraq s police and military forces now that almost all american combat forces have pulled back to bases outside of iraq s cities , that training has become the main mission in iraq the involvement of women in it has been a cultural shock for iraqi men far less accustomed to dealing with women professionally , especially in the military women spoke of inappropriate comments or uncomfortable flattery , and even gifts it was everything from candy to lingerie , said capt victoria ferreira , 29 , who spent a year with an 11person squad training iraqi officers how do you react to that \? thank you \? ' for the most part , though , iraqis seem to accept the role of women in the american military they have even expanded their own ranks for tasks like searching women at checkpoints even if it seems unlikely that women will be incorporated more widely into the iraqi armed forces anytime soon i think now , six years since the war started , they 've learned to adapt or tolerate the fact that in the american army we have high ranking positions that are filled by women , said capt violeta z sifuentes , who commands the 591st military police company it was not always so , she recalled of her first tour in samarra in 2006 they always thought my platoon sergeant or my squad leader was the one in charge until i was like , listen here i'm in charge whether you like it or not' the captain s remarks were typical the women serving in today s military represent a generational shift they are confident young women who have not had to fight the same gender battles their predecessors in uniform did i never felt like i had to fight to succeed in the army was how captain taafemcmenamy , who is 27 , put it women in today s military say they do not feel the same pressure to prove themselves they adapt and expect others to adapt they preserve their femininity without making much of it specialist hoeppner and her roommate , sergeant bradford , belong to the 361st tactical psychological operations company , which patrols the towns and villages of diyala with infantry squads to spread and collect information on a recent patrol in the small village of shifta , they seemed more of a novelty to the iraqis they encountered than the soldiers they patrolled with , taking up defensive positions alongside their male colleagues whenever they paused i actually had this milliondollar idea my first deployment , sergeant bradford said of her tour as a truck driver hauling supplies in 2004 i was like , i need something that s like a beer bong that i can hold in place so i can pee standing up without pulling my pants down cause we were truck drivers we 'd stop on the side of the road there s no bushes i was telling one of my soldiers about this great idea , and he said they already make that she produced from her bunk in her chu a device sold by rei called a it s even pink , specialist hoeppner interjected warhorse s supply officer a woman acquired dozens of them the first time one of them came around a truck and saw me peeing on a tire , she said of one of her male colleagues , i thought he was going to have a heart attack
there s a lot to chew on in john judis s essay on antistatism in america , but i thought it was particularly interesting as an example of what you might call a narrative of defeat a kind of story that both liberals and conservatives sometimes like to tell about our politics , which emphasizes the other side s immense advantages , and their own side s struggle against overwhelming odds here s a pair of representative passages this pattern of belief in limited government is deeply rooted in the american psyche and has regularly stymied efforts at reform americans have supported , or have come to support , specific governmental remedies , such as social security , the minimum wage , and environmental and consumer protections but , when a new program that expands government is proposed , they have displayed a general ideological predisposition against the power of government as obama tries to get his reform agenda through congress , this predisposition is already proving to be a formidable obstacle  liberals and progressives have fared poorly in the face of this staunch antistatist tradition , but there have still been periods when they have broken through and enacted major reforms during woodrow wilson s first term , franklin roosevelt s first term , lyndon johnson s first two years , and richard nixon s first term of course , another way of putting the first passage would be to say that americans tend to favor limited government only in theory , and once you give them statism they almost always vote to keep it another way of putting the second passage would be to say that thanks to four of the twentieth century s most consequential presidents , we have exactly the kind of immense , multitentacled administrative state that the original progressives dreamed of and that conservatives have occasionally managed to reform but never , ever managed to reduce and the nonetoopersuasive suggestion that statism fared poorly in modern america seems calculated to feed the conservative suspicion that if left to their own devices , liberals would favor a vast new expansion of government every single month but an exaggerated defeatism can be a close cousin to a sensible realism judis premise the progressive cause s enduring weakness , and the smallgovernment cause s strength is eminently debatable , but it isn t a coincidence that his essay goes on to offer some impressively cleareyed advice on how liberals should go about selling their agenda and i suspect that a similar dynamic often holds true on the right a republican officeholder looking to advance rightofcenter goals might be better served listening to a conservative mirror image of judis someone steeped , even to a fault , in conservatism s many defeats and liberalism s many victories than to those rightwingers who have convinced themselves that america is a nation of freemarketloving , governmentloathing reaganites and always will be
in an article posted on the times s web site , my colleague tamar lewin writes that dozens of colleges including amherst , bates , carleton , colby , vassar , wellesley and yale are embracing student blogs on their web sites , seeing them as a powerful marketing tool for high school students but , she adds , so far , none of the blogs match the interactivity and creativity of mit s , where they are posted prominently on the admissions homepage , along with hundreds of responses from prospective applicants all unedited the mit bloggers are even paid 10 an hour , for up to four hours a week ms lewin also notes , though , that not every admissions office has been so ready to welcome uncensored student writing we invite readers of the choice particularly students and parents to let us know whether such blogs have been of help to them in their college searches , and if so , which ones please use the comment box below
toronto three years ago at the world baseball classic , i thought the venezuelans would win instead , they were knocked out in the second round after losses to cuba and the dominican republic that year , the venezuelan pitching staff had kelvim escobar , freddy garcia , johan santana and carlos zambrano none of those pitchers are here this time but the venezuelan lineup is loaded their hitters are working out now , spraying balls all over the rogers center as i write this among the stars are outfielders magglio ordonez , bobby abreu and carlos guillen , infielders miguel cabrera , melvin mora and jose lopez and catcher ramon hernandez if we hit like we re supposed to , it will be ugly , said venezuela s manager , luis sojo , the former yankees infielder but you never know in this game the late scratch of zambrano from the roster , because of shoulder concerns , is a blow to the staff , as is the absence of santana , who is coming back from knee surgery and dealing with elbow issues at mets camp sojo will turn to younger pitchers like felix hernandez of the mariners and armando galarraga of the tigers to lead the staff , with francisco rodriguez of the mets as his closer venezuela opens against italy on saturday night
washington a former fbi director testified on friday that was drawn into a corrupt act when mr holder , who is presidentelect barack obama s nominee to be attorney general , became involved in the pardon of a fugitive businessman in 2001 but the former director , , who headed the federal bureau of investigation from 1993 to 2001 , said mr holder had learned from his terrible mistakes in the pardon of the financier , , by president bill clinton and deserved to be confirmed mr freeh testified on the second and final day of mr holder s confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee mr holder completed his own testimony in an allday session on thursday and was not present on friday when the committee heard testimony from a panel of supporters and opponents among the witnesses were two who criticized mr holder s support for another pardon , for 16 members of a puerto rican nationalist group known as the faln , which has been on an fbi list of domestic terrorist groups one witness , joseph f conner , the son of a banker killed in a 1975 bombing of the fraunces tavern in new york by the group , said mr holder had made an egregious recommendation mr holder said thursday that the sentences of 16 to 20 years were justifiably reduced because none of those given clemency had been accused of a crime resulting in a death after the hearing on friday , senator patrick j leahy , a vermont democrat who is the chairman of the judiciary panel , scheduled a committee vote on mr holder s nomination for wednesday , the day after inauguration day mr holder faced tougher questioning than most of mr obama s cabinet selections , but he is expected to win confirmation despite the reservations expressed by several republicans on the committee in his testimony mr freeh said , the pardon of marc rich was a corrupt act , but he said it was not an act by mr holder mr rich fled to switzerland in 1983 rather than face a trial on tax charges and obtained the pardon , issued on the last day of the clinton presidency , without the input of prosecutors in new york who had brought the case mr freeh placed most of the blame for the pardon on mr clinton , who picked mr freeh for the fbi job but mr freeh later had a falling out with mr clinton , beginning with a disagreement over an investigation into a 1996 bombing in saudi arabia that killed 19 americans mr freeh said mr holder had allowed himself to be used and coopted in the rich pardon , but he added that mr holder certainly did not execute this pardon and will never allow himself again to be put in that position mr holder was the deputy attorney general at the time of the pardon he advised the white house that he was neutral leaning towards favorable , a judgment later used by clinton associates to defend the decision mr holder told the committee on thursday that he regretted his role and would not repeat it
philadelphia anyone who saw a dismayed shane victorino pleading with his manager when he was taken out of game 5 in the eighth inning monday night may be a little surprised to know that no one in the phillies clubhouse was happier after the game than he was the reason for his broad smile and peppy demeanor was twofold the phillies had beaten the yankees , 86 , to force a game 6 of the world series at yankee stadium on wednesday , and victorino will be able to play in that game because his finger is not broken victorino was hit by an a j burnett pitch on the right index finger in the first inning the finger swelled up and appeared bruised almost instantly , victorino said , signaling that perhaps it was broken but xrays taken in the bottom of the second showed no fracture , and a relieved victorino promised he would be able to play wednesday definitely , he said it shouldn t be a problem at all we ve got a day off , and it should be fine victorino said he did not think burnett threw at him intentionally as revenge for the phillies hitting alex rodriguez with pitches three times in the series he said that after he was hit , burnett nodded apologetically to him twice when he got to first base in the second inning , when burnett came to the plate , he asked phillies catcher carlos ruiz to tell victorino that he was sorry and that the pitch was not intentional i knew it wasn t , victorino said , because if it was , he wouldn t have apologized but for a j to do that means a lot as the game progressed , victorino said he had trouble gripping the bat he went 0 for 3 but not the ball still , in the top of the eighth inning , with the phillies leading , 82 , he was replaced in center field by ben francisco but he did not realize he had been taken out of the game until he popped out of the dugout and saw francisco already out there i was like , oh , maybe i m not in , victorino said with a smile and a shrug confused , he went to manager charlie manuel and asked if he was supposed to be in center and francisco in left , which is as secure a defensive alignment as the phillies can offer in the outfield victorino pleaded his case , but manuel wanted to give him a rest , and would have none of it victorino did not hold any bitterness afterward there was definitely a miscommunication , victorino said but it s nothing it s fine i obviously wanted to play , but it was a mixup and it s fine once he was out of the game , victorino had to watch as the yankees attempted to stage a comeback alex rodriguez hit a tworun double to left that raul ibanez could not catch as he dived to his left a better outfielder , francisco might have been able to snare it had he been in left maybe i would have caught it , i don t know , francisco said raul was right there later , francisco was unable to throw out rodriguez at the plate on a shallow sacrifice fly to center by robinson cano watching as the yankees racked up three runs to cut the deficit to 85 produced some anxiety , but victorino did not question his teammates or his manager after the game i was definitely nervous , he said i don t want to be on the bench , especially if nothing is seriously wrong but again there was a caution and everything is fine
liv ullmann s production of tennessee williams s streetcar named desire is one of the hottest \( and hardesttoget \) tickets in town sold out well before it opened last week at the harvey theater of the brooklyn academy of music , the show is riding a raft of rave reviews , especially for cate blanchett as blanche dubois in his review , ben brantley writes ms ullmann and ms blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before , with the result that , as a friend of mine put it , you feel like you re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time ms ullmann , a norwegian actress best known for her roles in the films of ingmar bergman , sat down last week to talk about taking the reins on an american classic following are excerpts from her conversation an audio slide show on the production is here  of a streetcar named desire opened in 1947 , over 60 years from the opening of your production did that figure into your plans \? i ve been so eager to read everything about the play , and that escaped me i think it s a very lucky time we are showing a modern version , as modern as you are in 2009 we re showing a new version because it s directed by a woman we re showing a new version because it is made by an australian cast and a norwegian director none of us are rooted in the united states still has such an impact watching it many years later , especially with in the role of stanley it was made many years ago , and they had some limitations they had to take away several of the lines we have the advantage that i haven t taken away one line our production is completely faithful to everything he wrote i ve even put in two lines from the glass menagerie , which is ok , i believe blanche is looking at the stars and talking about the stars and then i took two lines , oh , the moon over my left shoulder , make a wish that s just before something beautiful in her life happens , which doesn t go well it is such an american play , yet nonamericans are putting their own handprint on it sometimes i think it s good that foreigners look at something that is very familiar to you we see that in life , when we get foreigners coming to our country , the way they choose to like or not like your country , what they find interesting or not interesting that goes also with a play when a foreigner looks at what is so natural for you , it s not natural for us , so we want to give it an extra light what about this play is its strength \? why does it hold up after so many years \? this is a play about a woman who has visions , who is educated , knows a lot , wants to share it , and then she comes to a place where people are twittering laughs there are people who are raw and just want to do the basic in life , and they are not interested in what she s coming with at the same time , she s also threatening to them , because they do not like to be seen as somebody who is uncultivated they get angry , she gets desperate and none of them see each other this is so right for our time we have people in leading positions that don t know how to phrase a thought in a way we can understand it and follow it we have media and people in the media who do not know how to tell the truth it s easier to lie about the truth then to give the truth blanche likes to make a story , likes to make life more beautiful she s a storyteller , but at the same time she s also tremendously honest when she thinks someone has seen her , discovered her for her , the truth is mortal each time she s absolutely truthful it s mortal , and it breaks her down did you see eye to eye with cate during rehearsals \? in all close relationships there also have to be conflicts at times what i want to say comes out not good , and maybe it s not clear enough she has her own vision , and doesn t hear what i want to say there will be times when we look at each other like , what do you mean \? there s conflict if you ve had a relationship that goes as deep as with cate and me , and we are struggling for the truth , and one is the watcher and the other is the doer , i think we can come out marvelous i love her when i worked with ingmar bergman we were as close as you can be but there was not one film where we didn t have a moment of anger he would run after me in the corridors , and people would find a big drama but it wasn t when he caught me we would both laugh it s a kind of energy , when the energy is really good did you see bergman on your shoulder or hear him in your ear saying try this \? was he with you during this process \? ingmar is always with me he s my best friend often when i acted and i ve had a lot of bad directors in my life i was thinking about what would ingmar have said i ve had wonderful teachers in the way of directors because i ve been an actor i know exactly what not to say that s very important talk about the design of the show where the kowalskis are living , above them you see one window , where the other couple is living we call them the edward hopper couple because everything there i stole from many of the pictures of edward hopper sometimes in the bedroom of the kowalskis , where blanche is staying , some of the visions are , not stolen , but inspired by the paintings i think that s very important who can influence us more than a painter \?

as a candidate , barack obama offered withering criticism of president bush s signing statements declarations that he would not enforce parts of the bills he signed so it was encouraging when president obama invalidated the bush signing statements last week and explained when he would issue statements of his own if mr obama lives up to the principles he outlined last week , he could roll back the excessive powers that mr bush claimed for his presidency , but the new president quickly issued a signing statement of his own that made us wonder just how clean a break he intended to make presidents have long issued signing statements , but mr bush used them with unprecedented frequency and brazenness when he signed a torture ban in 2005 , he made a groundless assertion that he could override congress and the courts on a major part in 2006 , the american bar association called on presidents not to issue statements that claimed the right not to enforce the law in principle , a president should veto a bill if he believes part of it is unconstitutional but mr obama s memo raised a legitimate concern that congress these days often passes omnibus bills if a big bill has only a few problematic parts , a president has to choose between vetoing the whole bill , or agreeing to enforce provisions he believes to be unconstitutional mr obama said he would try to work with congress to address constitutional concerns in advance once a bill passes , he said , he would object only over interpretations of the constitution that are well founded these are good policies , but the real test will be in how they are applied mr obama should not use signing statements , as mr bush did , to assert that his own interpretation of the constitution trumps those of congress and the courts if he wants to claim that his objection is well founded , then he should be able to point to court decisions or he should find a way to get the issue into court so the judiciary can make a call mr obama s first signing statement objected to parts of a recent spending bill that he signed most of his points were not particularly troubling mainly , they focused on provisions that attempt to micromanage decisions that legitimately belong to the president none comes close to mr bush s sweeping assertions of power still , mr obama s statement may not be entirely innocuous one somewhat unclear objection could be read as bumping up against the rights of executive branch whistleblowers in any case , the speed with which he issued the statement , and the number of provisions he objected to , raise concerns that he may use these statements too aggressively it will bear watching for eight years , the bush team did its best to disrupt the founders' careful allocation of power among the president , congress and the courts president obama s goal should be to restore that delicate balance
on wednesday , david rohde came home to an in the newsroom of the times there were tears , hugs and sustained applause for him and tahir ludin , an afghan journalist with whom rohde slipped down a 20foot wall and after being held captive by the taliban for more than seven months although word spread quickly last november among western reporters in afghanistan that rohde , ludin and their driver , asadullah mangal , had been snatched , the times persuaded news organizations around the world to keep a lid on the story with a simple appeal the kidnappers had demanded silence possibly by defying them , we would be signing david s death warrant , said bill keller , the paper s executive editor now that rohde and ludin are free mangal chose not to try to escape , rohde said a debate has erupted over whether keller and the times , normally driven to get stories in the paper , not suppress them , did the right thing we agonized over this constantly , keller said , revisited it frequently even after the captors sent out tapes in what seemed a possible bid for publicity , there was no coverage because , keller said , their initial instructions had been so explicit i have a feeling for what was going through the minds of times editors in 2005 , while i was washington editor of the knight ridder newspapers , our jerusalem correspondent , dion nissenbaum , and a british photographer were abducted in gaza by armed thugs fearing for their lives , i asked news organizations not to report it and none did fortunately , the journalists were freed within hours , not months had i been in keller s shoes , i would have done what he did for rohde and his companions , even though keller acknowledged , i 'll never know for sure whether our silence had any impact whatsoever on david s fate but some readers and even other journalists see hypocrisy when a news organization subordinates its fundamental obligation to inform the public to its human impulse to protect one of its own the times went to extraordinary lengths to quash the rohde story and to shape information that might be available to the kidnappers on the internet jimmy wales , the cofounder of wikipedia , to keep word of the kidnapping off that site , even as usereditors tried to post it michael yon , an independent journalist , posted an item on in march and was quickly asked to take it down , which he did , a times reporter , edited rohde s biography on wikipedia to highlight his reporting that could be seen as sympathetic to muslims and to remove the fact that he once worked for the christian science monitor moss wrote similar information on on the paper s web site he and , the times s spokeswoman , even persuaded a group of new england newspapers to remove rohde s wedding notice and photos from their web site so the kidnappers would not have personal information they could use to pressure him psychologically i found this last action troubling because the times takes a hard line against removing information from its own archive i was acting as david s friend , moss said i was not thinking at all about the first amendment richard vegh , a reader in rochester , minn , wrote that he was alarmed at the lengths the times went to because a hypothetical kidnapping involving a nonmedia insider or journalist would likely not be afforded the same consideration keller said the times listens to appeals to keep kidnappings quiet for the safety of the victims , and our tendency is to go along with that he said i would apply the same policy to a journalist , to a nonjournalist , to a civilian or to the military we do n't take life and death situations lightly but in practice , journalists seem to fare better journalists all know one another , and they know how the media works , said , executive director of the committee to protect journalists they know how to make the request for others , the news media can seem remote mike ackerman of miami , whose firm , the ackerman group , helps retrieve kidnap victims , said he 'd never requested a news blackout because we 've always assumed they would n't do it last fall , around the time rohde was abducted , the times and other news organizations sat for a month on the story of , a reporter for the canadian broadcasting corporation who was kidnapped in kabul while she was in captivity , the times an article about the kidnapping of a french aid worker in kabul susan chira , the foreign editor , said nobody made a request to hold that story the frenchman s small nongovernmental organization had told its people not to speak to reporters he was freed a month later , who covers afghanistan and pakistan for the times and wrote about the frenchman , said , i feel we should write about every kidnapping equally gall said she is on record with her editors as wanting coverage if she is abducted i am not convinced that keeping a kidnapping out of the news makes it any safer for the victims , she said the times went to extra lengths thursday , when it a terse announcement by the united states military that an american soldier had been taken hostage by the taliban in eastern afghanistan with rohde s case fresh in mind , the paper said it was assured by military officials that the details it was reporting would not increase the danger to the soldier , and that it had agreed not to name him if it learned his identity but bryan whitman , a pentagon spokesman , said the military made its announcement only because it believed a foreign news organization was going to run the story commanders in afghanistan had hoped for a news blackout while they tried to recover the soldier , he said dilemmas like the rohde kidnapping put editors in excruciating positions kelly mcbride , who teaches ethics at the poynter institute , a journalism training center in florida , criticized the times s decision in an open letter to keller published online , but she told me , knowing myself , i ca n't say i would have operated any differently mcbride said news organizations need a broad agreement on how to handle all kidnappings noting that most withhold some news , like the names of rape victims , she suggested options like reporting kidnappings but withholding names or affiliations of those captured such agreement seems a good but perhaps impossible goal in today s fragmented media world , especially in war zones , where news organizations from many countries may have far different standards keller said it is worth discussing trying to build in a pause so that news organizations can reach out to families or employers rather than expecting them to ask to find out what harm might be caused by reporting a kidnapping rohde knows what his standard would be the paper definitely did the right thing in his case , he said any request not to report a kidnapping i think should be honored
when tim naftali of the national archives became director of the nixon presidential library in 2007 , he promised to diversify the list of speakers and start at ground zero in revamping the library s historical exhibits many of his decisions have displeased members of the nixon foundation , located on the same property in yorba linda , calif , perhaps none so much as his selection of john dean , former white house counsel to richard m nixon , to speak at the site this evening the privately run nixon foundation and nixon supporters have run a weekslong campaign , including writing letters to all the living presidents , to protest mr dean s appearance and urge the library to cancel it robert odle , a former communications aide to richard nixon , told newsweek that mr dean s appearance was in poor taste it s like having monica lewinsky speak at the clinton library on the anniversary of president clinton s impeachment , said mr odle but mr naftali said the event will go on as planned at 7 pm \( pst \) library staff members have prepared for an overflow crowd , he said , by setting up a closed circuit television set in a large room next to the auditorium mr dean , who gave crucial testimony to congress in the hearings that led to president nixon s 1974 resignation , will discuss updates to his memoir , blind ambition , and sign copies of the book we are dedicated to a nonpartisan presentation of the facts of watergate , said mr naftali wednesday afternoon a visit by john dean forms part of that initiative the other part , he said , was a complete renovation of the library s watergate exhibit , to be completed this august john dean s importance to what is known as the watergate scandal is indisputable , said mr naftali , and if young people are going to learn about that drama they have to contend with mr dean and his role and the information he provided
beijing as s government doles out 584 billion to stimulate its ailing economy , critics inside and outside the communist party have pressed for details about the murky spending plan and demanded the right to follow the money a cluster of liberal communist party elders recently wrote to president and the rest of the party leadership , seizing on the economic troubles and the need for more accountability to promote democratic reforms we very much endorse the central authorities' investment of 4 trillion renminbi 584 billion to drive the economy , they explained in the letter , dated jan 20 , a copy of which was obtained by the new york times at the same time , we are extremely worried that the privileged and the corrupt will seize this opportunity to fatten themselves , damage the relationship between the party and the people , and intensify social conflict they pressed for checks and balances on the recovery program more sweepingly , they urged that state media be freed from censorship and that courts allowed to operate without interference from the ruling party , reforms the party has repeatedly rejected in the past the stimulus plan has led to calls for greater transparency from other quarters as well a shanghaibased lawyer , yan yiming , has threatened to sue the national development and reform commission , china s de facto central planning agency , unless it publishes an inventory of items approved for financing mr yan s crusade attracted legions of supporters online the government is working hard to look responsive , though without releasing much new information on sunday , a senior central planning agency official said the government would publicize project details as the plan was approved a partyrun liaison group called the chinese people s political consultative conference has also sought to use the country s annual parliamentary session , which opens on thursday , as a forum to show that the government is listening to demands for greater openness the chief drafter of the letter by the party elders was li rui , 91 , a secretary to mao zedong before being felled in a 1959 purge other signatories included a retired propaganda minister , zhu houze , and a publisher , du daozheng , along with 13 other aging members of the elite beyond the stimulus , a defense lawyer , zhang sizhi , one of the elders , said it was also fair to describe their letter as a vision of reforms vital for the party to endure in the long term the greater the difficulties , the elders said , the greater the need for democracy the government has vowed to spend its way out of the economic slump through public works projects , subsidies and tax breaks it is also trying to speed up social reforms like universal health care but the details have remained sketchy in november , china rushed out its stimulus plan with no public scrutiny , scant details of the spending breakdown and none of the acrimonious debate that slowed action in the united states the central government is financing less than onethird of the package , leaving local governments , banks and private enterprise to finance the rest the mandate from beijing is to ensure growth and expand domestic demand in their letter , the elders said they feared that the openended mandate would set off a binge of uncontrolled spending by regional and local interests , leading to waste and corruption china spent years before the recent crisis trying to rein in freewheeling local governments and statebacked business interests already , there are signs of a spending spree banks doubled their lending in january compared with the same month of 2008 , state media say some securities analysts estimate that loan recipients , mostly stateowned firms , funneled as much as a third of new loans into stock market trades , which may help explain a surge in the shanghai composite index this year despite the deepening gloom to track the loans , regulators have asked banks to submit account records the elders behind the letter amassed political clout in the 1980s , as rehabilitated reformists serving progressive party leaders but those leaders were later purged , and the deadly tiananmen square crackdown of 1989 ensued two decades later , their agenda of accelerated democracy remains a distant dream the party leadership has not responded to the letter , mr li s son said tuesday one of the elders , 80yearold du guang , said the call for democracy had become even more relevant during the economic downturn he said he was skeptical of the party s measures to supervise the stimulus spending mr du also criticized the focus on public works projects instead of the country s weak social services network you have to look at how to expand demand in the long term , he said social spending is more important than building railways , expressways and other basic infrastructure
the first edition of s joe buck live monday night received more publicity than it could have reasonably planned for , but for the wrong reason buck wanted recognition for his interview with brett favre about favre s plan to play if recent surgery restored his right arm s former power instead , the show hit the top 10 of google trends because of the foul mouth of the comedian artie lange of howard stern s sirius radio show lange appeared in the final segment of buck live , along with the actor and jason sudeikis of but it became an exercise in narcissism by lange , who capitalized on hbo s freedom of expression to blithely demonstrate his scatological , homophobic , shock comedy on a network that has bill maher hosting a weekly series , and an archive of george carlin and chris rock appearances , lange knew he could roam freely , even if he does not wield profanity with masterlevel sophistication but he thinks quick and dirty and has no boundaries he jabbered like he owned the show , knowing he was upping his nightclub fees and book sales on tuesday , lange told stern and chris russo , in interviews on sirius , that his presegment guidance from ross greenburg , the president of hbo sports , was to go nuts if the segment turned dull \( which it did \) but greenburg said he only told lange that if the segment dragged , we need your energy late in the day , in response to questions by email , lange backtracked on greenburg s instructions he said , in front of several people , look , if these two guys you are on with are boring , feel free to add any energy and excitement you want' he said greenburg did not tell him that anything goes and he stuck by his claim that buck told him beforehand to let me have it the larger question is what was hbo s motivation in booking lange \? to goose viewership \? to add a caustic edge to a new series starring someone known for calling baseball on fox and for some goofy commercials , but not for his skills as a talkshow host \? greenburg and buck said they wanted the artie lange who is a funny guy and a sports fan , the very same artie lange who behaved himself in taped appearances with david letterman but to unleash lange live against a host without the skill set of a letterman or a conan o'brien was too risky it is hbo and they know who i am , lange said in the email i'm not kathie lee gifford immodestly , he added , i may even wake the audience up after a mindnumbingly dull interview with brett favre he understood the opportunity set before him he was savvier than those who invited him he knew he could market himself on an hbo platform my only agenda was to be funny and make the show good , which is what i did , he said in the email i'm willing to believe that buck and greenburg did n't mind a large dollop of artie but they blanched at a heaping gallon of him he probably wanted to make a name for himself , greenburg said he s not a household name he s got a certain fan base under the stern umbrella maybe he thought he could become a household name but if you hypothesize that buck and greenburg , in any way , led lange to believe that he could profanely commandeer the segment , you have to accept the notion that they were willing to embarrass their new host for buzz and that such notoriety would be valuable capital to a network that does not sell advertising and does not talk about its need to appeal to young males who love lange if , somehow , hbo uses the lange effect to promote buck s next show , which is not for another three months , it would be telling subscribers keep watching , we might do it again and folks , meet joe s cohost artie lange hbo has a makeover job before buck s next show it will have to define buck is he a comic \? a brilliant interviewer \? a sharp essayist \? as yet , he is none of these he is a playbyplay announcer with some wit , unlike bob costas , whom buck is succeeding at hbo costas came to the cable network as a fully formed host the production of buck s debut did not serve him well a taped profile of the mets' david wright was too soft an interview with the former dallas cowboy michael irvin and cincinnati bengals receiver chad ochocinco , nee johnson , was inexplicably split by a taped piece on the smoking gun and the public relations executive ari fleischer the langeruddsudeikis panel was not only illdefined , until lange defined it , but one had to question what rudd and sudeikis , far from superstars , could bring to the launch of a new series and the favre segment was solid but not electric
is david letterman back \? if not all the way , the cbs latenight star certainly seems to be getting there he scored an impressive win last week in the latenight audience over nbc s tonight show with new host conan o brien , as that show suffered through the leastviewed week in tonight history and mr letterman trumped his win with a show that became a television event wednesday night as paul mccartney returned to the ed sullivan theater and performed a concert on the marquee in front of a crowd of about 4 , 000 on wednesday , mr letterman had 44 million viewers to 25 million for mr o brien abc s latenight entry , nightline , also experiencing a resurgence , drew 4 million mr o brien continues to be the strongest of the shows among younger viewers that many advertisers prefer , though his margins in that area have shrunk in recent weeks he has dropped to third place more regularly in total viewers , not a place tonight has often landed last week , mr o brien attracted 28 million viewers , below the previous low for tonight , 33 million , which mr o brien set in his third week mr letterman had 37 million nightline , helped by coverage of the michael jackson memorial , was the winner with 38 million \( nightline benefits by being measured for a halfhour vs an hour for the other shows \) the tonight numbers represented a steep drop from those scored by jay leno a year ago in the same week mr leno s tonight show had 46 million viewers , meaning mr o brien s show has fallen by 38 percent the story among younger viewers , especially those between the ages of 18 and 34 , continues to be much better for mr o brien he was up 26 percent in that group from mr leno last year , though down 7 percent among viewers between 18 and 49 mr letterman has been closing the gap a bit among younger viewers and last week managed a virtual tie with mr o brien among viewers between 25 and 54 , the first time he has done that since mr o brien s arrival guests have played a hand mr o brien could hardly match mr mccartney \( his guest was dana carvey \) and ratings for the nbc s 10 pm time period , which can help or hurt latenight shows , were especially weak wednesday night but one nbc latenight executive , who asked not to be identified when analyzing the network s competitive situation , said of mr letterman , dave is definitely on his game conan has to respond in the emmy nominations announced wednesday , mr letterman s show secured five nominations mr o brien s show had one \( mr leno s had none \) wednesday s show with mr mccartney was exciting even for the host mr letterman said in an email comment , given the history of the beatles at the ed sullivan theater , it s humbling just to have him on the show and for him to play in front of thousands in front of our theater was beyond generous and very special for us mr mccartney made the call to perform outdoors , an executive from the letterman show said mr letterman had leaned toward having mr mccartney sing on the same stage where the beatles first appeared in america in 1964 but the singer said he would only perform if he could make it an event
sarah palin has weighed in on president obama s healthcare plan and declares it to be downright evil the former governor of alaska , who was last year s republican nominee for vice president , sounds like she is in full campaign mode as she uses her facebook page to condemn the proposals working their way through congress one problem none of the bills emerging from various committees includes the kind of death panel that ms palin says would be rationing care it is the kind of mischaracterization that president obama has complained about , though the white house has had little success in persuading people otherwise here is her full entry as more americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through congress , our collective jaw is dropping , and we re saying not just no , but hell no ! the democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care , but as the economist thomas sowell has pointed out , government health care will not reduce the cost it will simply refuse to pay the cost and who will suffer the most when they ration care \? the sick , the elderly , and the disabled , of course the america i know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with down syndrome will have to stand in front of obama s death panel so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society , whether they are worthy of health care such a system is downright evil health care by definition involves life and death decisions human rights and human dignity must be at the center of any health care discussion for more about this widespread rumor that ms palin is repeating , see politifactcom , the pulitzer prizewinning factchecking arm of the st petersburg times on its truefalse meter , politifact says this one is so false , it rates as pants on fire
as commemorated its 50th anniversary on monday with an artistic and political extravaganza in the newly renovated alice tully hall , the festivities were , of course , also a celebration of the great emancipator himself , , who gave his name to the place not or , well , perhaps surprisingly , after five decades , the origin of the word lincoln in lincoln center is a mystery , said judith johnson , lincoln center s corporate archivist it is one of those questions that should have an answer because so many other places in new york have a reason for their naming but that s not true here certainly there is no doubt , she said , that it was decided , in 1956 , to name lincoln center after the neighborhood in which it was built lincoln square , the area between columbus and amsterdam avenues from west 63rd to 66th streets after all , in 1906 the shubert organization opened a 1 , 600seat theater there called the lincoln square , on what is now the site of the juilliard school records show that the new york city board of aldermen formally named the area lincoln square in may 1906 the minutes of their meetings are devoid of discussion , however , about the reason for the name as to whether honest abe provided the inspiration , we could n't find anything that was conclusive one way or the other , ms johnson said through the generations on the upper west side , there used to be an idea that the area was called lincoln farms , said harold holzer , cochairman of the lincoln bicentennial commission perhaps it was a longheld urban myth that dates back to the time of a rural myth but the property records in the new york municipal archives list six local landowners in the area , and nary a lincoln surname among them we searched obituaries , archives of the parks department and many other records and could n't find any landowner with the name of lincoln , ms johnson said mr holzer , who has written 34 books about lincoln and the civil war , confirmed that many historians have looked in the archives , and it is truly bizarre that there is no record of why it was named lincoln square the whole lincoln name thing gets even trickier when the board of aldermen granted lincoln square its name , the city s mayor was george b mcclellan yes , that mcclellan the son of the civil war general and lincoln rival who was so contemptuous of the rail splitter that he referred to him as the original gorilla there is the wonderful irony , mr holzer said of the possibility that lincoln square was named after the president during the tenure of a new york mayor who was the son of the general who gave lincoln more difficulty than anyone during the civil war the mcclellan who opposed emancipation and ran against lincoln in 1864 one has to reasonably assume that the square was named for abraham lincoln , he added , but the dearth of references to the president in the records could have been inspired by the legacy of enmity between the general and the commander perhaps they played down the connection to president lincoln in deference to the sensibilities of the mcclellan family , mr holzer said in the end , such considerations counted little for the 800 guests at the celebration in tully hall , which began with a performance of fanfare for the common man by aaron copland as tom brokaw served as the anchorman er , host audra mcdonald sang itzhak perlman and wynton marsalis played mayor michael r bloomberg and charles e schumer , new york s senior senator , speechified the festivities were streamed live on the lincoln center web site ,  but none of the revelers resolved the obscure origin of the arts center s name
let s say that you are president obama you 've inherited a health care system that is the insane spawn of a team of evil geniuses from an alien power pay is divorced from performance users are separated from costs rising costs threaten to destroy your nation and everything you hold dear because you have a lofty perspective on things , you know there are basically two ways to fix this mess there is the liberal way , in which the government takes over the health care system and decides who gets what and then there is the conservative way , in which costconscious consumers make choices in the context of a competitive marketplace you also know that these two approaches have one thing in common they are both currently politically unsellable others have tried and perished there are vast \( opposing \) armies arrayed against them the whole issue is a nightmare you are daunted by the challenges in front of you until you remember that by some great act of fortune , you happen to be barack obama this calms you down you conceive a strategy the first step in this strategy is tablesetting you will spend the first several months of your administration talking grandly about the need for reform you will invite all interested parties to the table , and you will serve a great heaping plate of pabulum you will talk about things that no sentient person could possibly disagree with about the need for better information technology and for more preventive care there will be less health care nittygritty here than in your average prek circle time , but you are getting everybody talking you are building relationships in stage two , you pass everything over to congress you 'll need these windbags at the end , so you might as well get them busy at the beginning this will produce a whirl of white papers , a flurry of committee activity , a set of legislative rivalries as every chairman in the stable seeks to be the lead horse in the romp to legislative glory all you have to do is raise a portentous eyebrow from time to time , signaling grand approval of the various proposals as they blow by this brings us to the current stage the long tease every player in this game has a favorite idea , and you are open to all of them the liberals want a public plan , and you 're for it the budget guys are for slashing medicare reimbursements , and you 're for that the doctors want relief from lawsuits , and you 're open to it the republicans want you to cap the tax exemption on employee health benefits you campaigned against that , but you 're still privately for it you ran on a platform of hope and , boy , are you delivering every special interest in washington lives in hope that they will get their pet idea incorporated into the final bill none will come out and oppose you because they live in hope even the different factions in your own administration live in hope one of your health advisers pretended to smile at one of your economists ! this brings you to the final stage , the scrum this is the set of allnight meetings at the end of the congressional summer session when all the different pieces actually get put together you want the scrum to be quick so that the bill is passed before some of the interests groups realize that they 've been decapitated you want the scrum to be frantic so you can tell your allies that their reservations might destroy the whole effort \( this is how you are going to get the liberals to water down the public plan and the moderates to loosen their fiscal rectitude \) the scrum will be an ugly , allout scramble for dough you can probably get expanded coverage out of it you can hammer the hospitals and get much of the 12 trillion to pay for the expansion but you wo n't be able to honestly address the toughest issues and still hold your coalition you wo n't get the kind of structural change that will bring down costs longterm in the scrum , congress will embrace the easy stuff and bury the hard stuff which is why you have medpac that s the medicare payment advisory commission that you want to turn into a health care federal reserve board an aloof technocratic body of experts that will make tough decisions beyond the reach of politics you can take every thorny issue , throw it to medpac and consider it solved conservatives will claim you 're giving enormous power to an unelected bunch of wonks they 'll say that health care is too complicated to be run by experts from washington but you 'll say that you are rising above politics you 'll have your \( partial \) health care victory not bad for a skinny guy with big ears
the head of the united states secret service told lawmakers on thursday that three agents responsible for letting michaele and tareq salahi into the white house state dinner last month have been placed on leave the individuals have been identified and have been put on administrative leave , mark sullivan , the agency s director , said during a hearing called by the house homeland security committee to investigate the white house security breach the agents could face dismissal mr sullivan ruled nothing out , saying appropriate action would be taken once the agency s investigation was completed mr sullivan gave a few other details about the inquiry into just how the uninvited couple managed to get beyond two security checkpoints staffed by the secret service agents were supposed to be checking guests names against a list of vetted names compiled by the white house social staff he said the incident was pure and simple this is a human error , adding , when people don t follow the established guidelines , something like this is going to happen separately , president obama acknowledged in an interview with usa today on thursday that the system didn t work the way it was supposed to at last week s dinner but he added , i could not have more confidence in the secret service they do an outstanding job they have been with me since i was a candidate , mr obama told the newspaper i trust them 100 percent , not just with me but with my wife and my children the president s security was indeed another issue at the house hearing the state dinner security lapse set off a flurry of discussion about whether mr obama faces more security threats than his predecessors coupled with the fact that he received secret service protection earlier than most presidential candidates during his campaign at the hearing , mr sullivan said that despite reports to the contrary , mr obama is under no greater threat than the previous two presidents , george w bush and bill clinton absent from the hearing were the salahis and desiree rogers , the white house social secretary although some committee members threatened to subpoena those witnesses , at this point , the salahis declined on advice of their lawyer in addition , the white house announced on wednesday that ms rogers would not testify , and cited the separation of powers under the constitution as a reason for blocking her appearance the secret service began the investigation , now in its seventh day , when they were advised by facebook about the intruders mr sullivan assured lawmakers that mr obama was not in any danger , and that the salahis were the only ones who got through the security process he said the agent should have contacted his immediate supervisor and communicated with the white house staff upon finding that the salahis were not on his list none of this happened the salahis told the agent that they should have been on the list and that they were invited the agent also did not call the protocol center to determine whether the couple had clearance , he added in the absence of a representative from the white house social office , lawmakers pressed mr sullivan for an explanation of how during preparations for the event the secret service and white house agreed not to place an administration representative at the initial checkpoint as is customary members in both parties seemed bent on determining whether it was the white house or the secret service who recommended no one from the president s staff greet guests at door , but mr sullivan could not provide a definitive answer , calling it a joint recommendation but he did say the secret service accepted responsibility for the lapse the administration announced on wednesday that from now on , a representative of the social secretary s office will be stationed at security checkpoints for major social events in case questions arise republicans were particularly incensed that ms rogers , the white house social secretary , declined to testify and the committee s ranking republican , representative peter king , said he wanted to subpoena ms rogers in addition to the salahis \( in either case , the entire committee would need to vote in favor of a subpoena \) we always expect the secret service to take a bullet for the president , but we don t expect the secret service to take a bullet for the president s staff , said representative charlie dent , republican of pennsylvania representative bennie thompson , the committee s chairman , however , did not seem as perturbed the social office plans parties they are not responsible for security , he said when pressed he repeated , they are party planners jeff zeleny contributed to this post
tehran the case against , the iranianamerican journalist who was convicted here on charges of spying and then released this week on appeal , was based on her possession of a classified document and on trips she made to israel , one of her lawyers said in an interview on wednesday the document , a 2003 report on the planned united states invasion of iraq , was prepared by a research organization affiliated with the office of the iranian president at the time , mohammad khatami , the lawyer , saleh nikbakht , said he said that ms saberi found the article on a desk in the offices of the expediency council , a group of senior figures who advise the supreme religious leader , ayatollah ali khamenei she worked there as a translator , putting englishlanguage articles on its web site the interior ministry interrogators who questioned ms saberi thought that the article was confidential or secret at the time she obtained it , mr nikbakht said , but it was actually only classified , which is not as restricted in the intervening years , he said , it was declassified he said the interrogators' suspicions were also raised by ms saberi s possession of some internal papers from a conservative political party as well as by the trips to israel ms saberi , 32 , was arrested in january for buying wine , an act that is illegal in , and was later charged with working without press credentials , which were revoked in 2006 in april she was convicted on charges of spying for washington and  she had been living and working in iran since 2003 , reporting on a variety of issues for news organizations , including national public radio and the british broadcasting corporation while she did travel to iraq in the early years of the war , she does not seem to have reported on the american invasion for the bbc an npr spokeswoman , dana davis rehm , said ms saberi did not cover the american invasion of iraq for the network , or do background work for it on that subject we are completely confident that the documents roxana possessed are not relevant to her work for npr , ms rehm said she said ms saberi did not travel to israel on behalf of npr mr nikbakht said that ms saberi made two trips to israel in 2006 , using her iranian passport to get as far as syria or lebanon and then her american passport to go to israel iranians are not permitted to travel to israel it was those trips that first caught the attention of the intelligence ministry , he said you have to put yourself in the mindset of the intelligence people , mr nikbakht said when they put all this together they came up with the charges against her she traveled to israel and they became suspicious that she was taking confidential documents for the americans mr nikbakht said that he and another lawyer , abdolsamad khoramshahi , secured her release by arguing that the documents were not classified or confidential , and that iran and the united states were not at war therefore , he contended , the charges against her could not amount to spying ms saberi s arrest followed president obama s overture to iran , the first from an american president since the 1979 islamic revolution and the taking of american hostages at the united states embassy american officials , including mr obama , had dismissed the charges against her as politically motivated and urged her release political commentators here said her release reflected a consensus among the iranian authorities about sending a signal to the united states that a thaw in relations might be possible the court played a role in her release , said alireza rajaee , a political analyst in tehran but we cannot deny the hardliners' willingness to let her go during her appeal , ms saberi admitted copying the article on the iraq invasion and said that an admirer at the conservative political party had provided her with the party s internal papers no charges were brought against her for possessing those papers we argued that none of the documents were secret or confidential because they did not bear the title , mr nikbakht said ms saberi also said she had never used any of them he said she had told the court that she was collecting the information for her book on the nature of power in iran , and that she had traveled to israel to look for a job mr nikbakht said that ms saberi had told the judges she was so terrified after her arrest that she made up a story , hoping it would help her get out of jail she told them that a former us official had proposed to her to work for the cia during one of her trips to washington , but she said she did not take it seriously , mr nikbakht said while the court dismissed the spying charges , it did give ms saberi a suspended twoyear sentence and barred her from practicing journalism in iran for five years she met briefly in tehran with reporters on tuesday and said she had no immediate plans
an nhon tay , the first day of school was a special one last month for the 15 children from the here they are infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , and for the first time they would be allowed to attend the local primary school the children were so excited , said sister nguyen thi bao , who runs the orphanage and had been lobbying for three years to enroll them in the government school they had been wishing for this day to come but when they arrived , they found an uprising by the parents of the other students , who refused to let their children enter the school together with the infected orphans some of the parents hastily backed away when the orphans walked past after a short standoff , the principal , who had agreed to accept the orphans , told sister bao that their papers were not in order and that they could not stay the children returned to the orphanage , just a short walk down a country road , where they continue to study in small classrooms , still exiled from the uninfected world i was so happy to go to the school , said a 12yearold fourth grader for whom sister bao insisted on anonymity to keep her from the spotlight but then i saw that some parents would n't let their children go to school with me because they are scared of my disease the girl said she understood their reaction if i were a normal child , i would be afraid , too , because i would n't understand , she said i would feel the same way but i would n't have acted the way they did sister bao and officials of the district and the school , the an nhon dong elementary school , have met with the parents since then , but they remain adamant i do n't want my child to be with the children , nguyen thi thuy , 36 , said the other day as she brought her 8yearold son to school he could be injured , and it s easy to transmit the disease through blood and once you 're sick , it s difficult to become a normal person again one after another , parents who arrived with their children on small motorbikes raised their voices in agreement if the orphans came back , said a man who gave his name only as tam , he would pull his son out again the story is not surprising , said eamonn murphy , vietnam director for , the united nations' aidsfighting agency you go to any rural environment in asia , and you are going to have similar reactions , he said the general lack of understanding leads to this inappropriate reaction and fear most of the parents here are farmers with little education , but the prejudice seemed to extend to city folk as well i do n't know why we do n't isolate people with aids , said a civil servant in ho chi minh city , about 20 miles southeast of the village even with we isolate people , and this disease is much more dangerous there is no truth to these fears , mr murphy said hiv is not contagious from community contact , even if you are sharing cups and saucers and eating from a communal plate you ca n't get hiv from that in recent years , vietnam s prevention and treatment programs have been improving , mr murphy said , although so far only 30 percent of people who need lifesaving antiretroviral drugs receive them about 290 , 000 people in vietnam , a country of 86 million , carry hiv today , and mr murphy said that although the rate of increase was slowing , the infection was spreading outside highrisk groups among those infected , the government estimates that 5 , 100 are children although the law requires equal treatment , almost none of them have been accepted in schools because of the fears of other children s parents , nguyen vinh hien , the deputy minister of education , said last month he said the ministry would try to enroll at least half of these children in government schools by next year , but the experience of the mai hoa orphans suggests that this will not be easy frightened and angry on that first day , some of the parents seemed heartless , sister bao said they were saying the children were going to die anyway , so there s no need for them to study , she said if they are going to study , let them do it in the orphanage , and not put our children in danger' the with its green and quiet grounds , was founded by a roman catholic order in 2003 as a hospice for patients in the final stages of the disease it added the orphanage to care for children of people who died there the children are infected as well , sister bao said , but are receiving antiretroviral medication the buildings behind the classrooms are still a , where a dozen emaciated patients lie on cots altogether , 250 people have died , sister bao said , including 90 whose unclaimed ashes are stored behind the hospice buildings some of those are the remains of the children s parents so the orphans of mai hoa live suspended between the death that fills the space behind their classrooms and the life of a world , just down the road , that still will not accept them the children say they want to go to the other school because they want to have friends , sister bao said but the 12yearold fourthgrader seemed to have changed her mind i do n't want to go to that school , she said i already have enough friends here
islamabad , when the envoy arrives here monday looking for ways to stop a runaway islamist insurgency that is destabilizing pakistan , he will find a proamerican but weak civilian government , and a powerful army unaccustomed and averse to fighting a domestic enemy in a nucleararmed nation regarded as an ally of the united states and considered pivotal by the obama administration to ending the war in neighboring afghanistan , mr holbrooke will face a surge of antiamerican sentiment on clear display by private citizens , public officials and increasingly potent television talk shows some remedies offered by his hosts are likely to be unappealing on almost every front , pakistani leaders are calling for less american involvement , or at least the appearance of it the main reason for the swell in resentment here is the very strategy that the united states government considers its prime success against al qaeda missile strikes delivered by remotely piloted aircraft against militants in pakistan s tribal areas to the surprise of many pakistanis , who had been promised by their leaders that the new administration in washington would be different , s inauguration according to the pakistanis , as many as 21 civilians were killed by the strikes , in north and south waziristan fury at the continued airstrikes is considered one of the reasons for the poor showing of president asif ali zardari in public opinion surveys many pakistanis view mr zardari as too close to his american patrons he is widely believed to have agreed to a request from president bush for a widening of the drone strikes , which had been conducted far more sparingly before mr zardari came to power last september in an effort on saturday to assuage an angry public , mr zardari told an audience in peshawar , in the northwest frontier province , that he would argue against the drone attacks during mr holbrooke s visit according to the pakistani state press agency , mr zardari said that the drone attacks were counterproductive and that the day was not far away when these attacks will be stopped mr zardari s sudden appearance in peshawar , a city virtually under siege from the taliban , just two days before mr holbrooke s arrival was his first there since he became president he was reported to have said that the visit by mr holbrooke , mr obama s special representative to afghanistan and pakistan , would give him the opportunity to educate the administration we will tell them fighting was no solution to the imbroglio , mr zardari was quoted as having said , and let us handle it in our own way , as we know better than them as to how best the issue could be tackled pakistani officials said they agreed with the american assessment that the airstrikes had killed some of the senior leadership of al qaeda but the civilian casualties that have accompanied the attacks have accelerated antiamerican feelings and made the pakistani military appear feeble , they said they argued that shortterm tactical gains were likely to be outstripped by longterm strategic losses even when the real militants get killed , there is also a high probability that unarmed civilians get killed , said farhatullah babar , the spokesman for mr zardari people get galvanized and become sympathetic to the militants the best alternative , mr babar and former and current military officials said , was for the americans to share intelligence with the pakistanis , and for the pakistanis to carry out the attacks if pakistan conducted the air raids , they said , the militants could not contend that the battle against them was america s war at the very least , the pakistanis say , they will drive home to mr holbrooke the need for american military aid to help fight the insurgents in particular , helicopters and nightvision gear in a startling example of its shortcomings in counterterrorism , the pakistani army has been unable to thwart the , an area just 100 miles from this capital city there , an army division of about 12 , 000 men has lost ground to the roughly 3 , 000 taliban the radio programs of the militant leader , maulana fazlullah , have proved a virulent weapon , forcing landowners to flee , terrorizing the police and spreading hatred of the government a spokesman for the army , gen athar abbas , said the militant s radio broadcasts were difficult to track because they shifted from one place to another the army is trying to get the technology to jam the transmissions but has been unable to do so , he said in a recent briefing of pakistani journalists , the army said it had acquired a strong transmitter from china but had not yet installed it those kinds of failures , and the fact that none of the top leaders of the pakistani taliban have been killed , have prompted sharp criticism of the army from politicians aligned with mr zardari in a televised interview , one such politician , hasham baber , a member of the awami national party which controls the northwest frontier province accused the powerful interservices intelligence agency and the army of being allies of the militants even if the united states increases military assistance for fighting the insurgency , it will be difficult to coax a better counterterrorism performance from the pakistani army , in part because of its deep suspicion about the united states' intentions mr obama said last week that a central goal would be to prevent nucleararmed pakistan from destabilizing afghanistan by that , he is widely understood to have meant that the jihadists who use the tribal area as a base to attack american troops in afghanistan , and to sweep down elsewhere in pakistan , must be conquered some pakistani strategic planners , however , interpret mr obama s plan to send more troops to afghanistan as a direct threat to pakistan , and in particular to its nuclear arsenal the belief , according to a senior pakistani military officer , is that additional forces in afghanistan would spill over into pakistan afghanistan is irrelevant , said the officer , who spoke on condition of anonymity the american troops are designed to create a mess in the tribal areas and in pakistan , and take the nukes another major irritant in the bilateral relationship that could hamper cooperation from the pakistani military stems from the decision by the bush administration to complete a nuclear deal with india , pakistan s archenemy the deal permits civilian nuclear trade between india and the united states , even though india has not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty this enhanced relationship was interpreted as a serious snub to pakistan , said maleeha lodhi , who served twice as pakistani ambassador to the united states the indous deal , she said , signified to the pakistani military that while washington saw its ties with pakistan in tactical terms , the strategic relationship was forged with india to overcome qualms in pakistan about the united states , mr holbrooke is likely to emphasize washington s plans for a drastic increase in aid to the country s educational , health and judicial systems , all areas that the united states has supported in the past , but to little effect because of deep corruption in line with legislation for the assistance written by vice president joseph r biden jr when he was in the senate , mr holbrooke will insist that the flow of aid depends on pakistan s determination to act against terrorism pakistanis see that condition , too , as demeaning an approach that treats pakistan from the paradigm of hired help , ' rather than valued ally , ms lodhi wrote in a pakistani daily paper , the news , should be unacceptable to islamabad

washington as the battle over health care lurches toward a conclusion , is confronting an increasingly sharp divide on the democratic left , with liberals in the senate and the house split on a critical question how much of what they want is enough \? in the senate , where time is running out for democrats to meet the president s deadline of passing a bill by christmas , liberals signaled on tuesday that they would hold their noses and vote for a version of the measure that would strip out some of their most cherished provisions , including an expansion of and the possibility of a  but the house seemed unwilling to fall in line the majority leader , representative steny h hoyer of maryland , said flatly on tuesday that the house would not simply take the senate bill and adopt it unchanged and howard dean , the former vermont governor and presidential candidate who is a respected voice among liberals , stirred the pot on the democratic left by saying , the best thing to do right now is kill the senate bill and start over at the white house , mr obama declared himself cautiously optimistic after a meeting with the entire senate democratic caucus , where he urged senators to put aside their differences and seize the moment , to pass a measure that would extend health coverage to 30 million uninsured americans now , let s be clear , mr obama said after the hourlong private meeting the final bill wo n't include everything that everybody wants no bill can do that but what i told my former colleagues today is that we simply cannot allow differences over individual elements of this plan to prevent us from meeting our responsibility to solve a longstanding and urgent problem for the american people the meeting underscored the sense of urgency for mr obama , who has made passing a health care overhaul his highest legislative priority he is leaving on thursday night for copenhagen to attend a conference on , and he acknowledged that there are still disagreements that have to be ironed out and work to be done in the next few days in the senate , democratic leaders said they were confident they could resolve those disagreements because liberals seemed willing to make concessions to get a bill passed the latest version of the senate legislation omits a new governmentrun insurance plan to compete with the private sector , and the expansion of medicare to allow people as young as 55 to buy into it we are very disappointed , said senator sherrod brown , democrat of ohio , who is a leading liberal in the senate still , mr brown said , i'm going to vote for the bill there s too much at stake speaking to reporters after the white house session , the no 2 democrat in the senate , senator richard j durbin of illinois , cast the liberals' dilemma this way many of us who are on that side of the caucus really felt we had to weigh on balance what remains and what remains is dramatic , and we just do n't want to lose the opportunity , the onceinalifetime opportunity the senate majority leader , harry reid of nevada , is still putting the bill together , but he and other leading democrats sounded confident after the session with mr obama that they would get the 60 votes they need to overcome staunch republican opposition mr reid sketched out a timeline in which he would move friday to bring the debate to a close and would hold final votes on the bill on dec 23 or 24 senator max baucus , democrat of montana and chairman of the finance committee , said we do n't have 60 votes locked in yet but we will get 60 in the house , though , liberals were none too pleased representative lynn woolsey , democrat of california and cochairwoman of the congressional progressive caucus , said it would be very difficult for her to vote for legislation that does not include a government plan , dubbed a public option , or a medicare buyin without that and without any public option , i do n't see what we are offering the american people , ms woolsey said we are not offering any significant competition to the insurance industry premiums could skyrocket as democrats debated among themselves , republicans made clear that they would fight the bill every step of the way in the senate our democratic friends are about to walk off a political cliff here , senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina , said tuesday do we really want to change onesixth of the economy without a single republican vote \? one republican being courted by the white house , senator susan collins of maine , said tuesday that she could not vote for the measure in its current form this bill is getting better , she said , but it s still too deeply flawed for me to support it other issues flared tuesday as well the senate rejected a bipartisan proposal to allow imports of prescription drugs from canada and other countries where prices are often lower the provision fell 9 votes short of the 60 needed the senate also turned down a republican effort to revise the bill to eliminate any tax increases for individuals with incomes less than 200 , 000 a year and for couples with incomes less than 250 , 000 at the same time , democrats are trying to negotiate a compromise on coverage that would help win the vote of senator ben nelson , democrat of nebraska at the white house session , mr obama tried to appeal to lawmakers' sense of history mr baucus , who took notes on a paper napkin , quoted the president as saying this is the moment of our legislative lifetimes this is why people run for public office , to be here at the creation of something really big just how big , though , remains an open question , especially among liberals in the president s party the session was called after senator , independent of connecticut , announced over the weekend that he could not vote for the measure unless the medicare expansion was stripped from the bill several people who attended the session recounted this exchange what s happening is not any fun for me , mr lieberman said mr brown , who has championed the public option , turned to mr lieberman and said , you know , joe , it s not fun for us either at that point , mr obama stepped in why do n't we all begin to have some fun \?

masquerade as terrorist organizations , he said , to maintain the state of instability in nineveh province mr zebari , a kurd , belongs to al hadba , a mainly sunni arab coalition led by mr nujaifi ,

most presidents and vice presidents refrain from attacking their successors after they leave office , especially on highly sensitive matters like , say , the safety of the nation at the very least , they wait until they write their inevitable , usually tedious , memoir not dick cheney he didn t wait even a month in an interview published today by the website politico , the \( thankfully \) former vice president let loose a stream of disinformation and attacks on mr obama that were breathtaking even by the standards of a man who set new lows for meanness and dissembling for example  mr obama is making it more likely terrorists will launch a catastrophic nuclear or biological attack on the united states because he doesn t want to torture prisoners , violate the geneva conventions , and ignore the constitution and federal law mr cheney s evidence \? none whatsoever it was just yet another way for him to justify the repugnant policies he helped put in place for the treatment of detainees after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  mr obama is more concerned about reading the rights to an al qaeda terrorist than with protecting the united states against people who are absolutely committed to do anything they can to kill americans once again , this is nonsense just the sort of bald propaganda mr cheney and mr bush used to frighten congress into voting for appalling pieces of legislation like the military commissions act of 2006 , the patriot act and warrantless wiretapping mr obama has ordered an end to the kangaroo courts at guantanamo bay , where prisoners are considered guilty before their convictions , and he has ordered guantanamo shut down , which even george w bush conceded was necessary he is not coddling any form of terrorist rather , he is searching for ways to try , convict , and imprison dangerous men even though many of them have been treated so brutally by the bush administration that it will be exceedingly difficult now to bring them to trial in a civilized courtroom  instead of sitting down and carefully evaluating the policies , the obama team is preparing to release dangerous criminals that , of course , is also not true first , the obama administration is conducting an exhaustive review of bush administration policies a painful process that would not be necessary if mr cheney and his team had not insisted on ignoring or violating so many laws and they are planning to try the guantanamo detainees who should be tried in real courts  the 200 or so inmates still in guantanamo are the hard core who would go back to fighting the united states not even the military prosecutors at guantanamo believe this particular piece of disinformation a small minority of the inmates left in the prison are actually hard core terrorists many are guilty of nothing at all  the current recession may be a onceinacentury disaster caused by the combination of the fiscal crisis that started last year , coupled now with , obviously , a major recession mr cheney forgot to mention the bush administration s central role in creating both the financial meltdown and the recession mr cheney is also concerned about the stimulus and economic recovery bill being considered by congress and the potential consequences of 1 trillion in deficit spending it s huge , obvious , potentially huge , he said you worry about what ultimately happens to inflation you worry about what s going to happen to the ability of the government to borrow money i m nervous we sure wish mr cheney had thought of that when he was helping mr bush run up historic deficits by cutting taxes for the rich while fighting two wars which many people warned the administration was going to lead to economic disaster but apparently , that was not on the vice president s mind while he was in office asked whether the bush administration should have done more about the economy , he said we did worry about it , to some extent after reading the interview , we found ourselves wishing mr cheney would simply retire and stay out of the public eye to a great extent
we thought we would go out to visit sheik abdullah  the sheik is an alyawar , the leading family of iraq s enormous shammar tribe he describes them as the kennedys of iraq , a understated comparison framed pictures are scattered on tabletops in his home showing himself , his brothers , his father and grandfather with kings , heads of state and , among the more recent , gen david petraeus when asked a fairly simple question about his family s current involvement in politics , he begins under the ottoman rule and goes on to talk of the british , of revolts in the 50 s , of long periods in exile so this is the kind of man sheik abdullah humedi ajeel alyawar is he has started a new political movement in the north , with national ambitions , so we arranged a visit to his estate not far from the syrian border as we were staying in the kurdish city of dohuk , he told us he would send drivers to meet near , but not at , the border with kurdistan arabs , even emissaries from a powerful sheik , can expect a cold welcome from the kurdish security forces we set out early , passing through the mountains and hills around dohuk and into the sea of green fields in western kurdistan , an area not unlike texas , where oil pumps bow and rise steadily in the distance soon we cross the bridge separating kurdistan from the rest of iraq the usual edginess returns so does the sand and the brown but we quickly come across the sheik s men waiting by the side of the road in pickup trucks the first indication that you ve reached the sheik s estate is a sort of security slalom mounds of dirt are closely staggered at the entrance to and at several points along his endless driveway , forcing every car to drive a fairly demanding obstacle course future guests would do well to think about power steering the route runs for miles , past the sheik s irrigated fields , past a row of greenhouses , 22 in all , past a series of evergrimmer looking armed guards wearing long beards , keffiyehs and seriously inhospitable expressions the sheik is wealthy and powerful and he lets it show it shows from the distance , when you see his palace isolated , fortified and flagtopped amid all the flat greenness it shows in the pasture on your right , where he keeps the thoroughbreds and arabians he buys regularly from dealers in dubai in the large semicircle of lesser sheiks who wait patiently in plastic chairs on his lawn , hoping to get in a word , or at least , an appearance in his house , everywhere , in the shiny box of cohiba cigars , in the gilded mirrors , clocks and giltframed family portraits , in the magnificent persian rug hanging across an entire wall in the anteroom the rug depicts the women , wine and song waiting in the afterlife \( and which for reasons possibly having to do with the licentiousness of the scene or the persianness of the make , he refuses to be photographed near \) none of this would be exceptional at a sheik s house in , say , dubai but this isn t dubai there are questions about the sheik , about how much power he actually has within the family , and whispered stories about his entertaining american officials in one room of the palace while dealing with bitter foes of the americans in another the americans in the north talk of these rumors with a mixture of amusement and unease the tribe , as sheik abdullah will remind you often , is the first and basic unit of power it is the building block of iraq now and it was when the assyrians were going around carving winged bulls on everything the tribe goes back before such novelties as modern capitalism , back before the state , before the big religions before journalists certainly , though he was kind enough to offer lunch we moved into the dining room , where servants had already laid out a spread fit for a merchant fleet , thinking the interview would continue but the sheik didn t show later , on a tour of his pasture , he explained diet , see doctor s orders everyone has constraints

it s always good to get out of washington for a little while and come to places like costa mesa because the climate s a lot nicer and so is the conversation so i'm looking forward to taking your questions in a few minutes and talking with you about your concerns before i do , i want to say a few words about the aig bonuses you 've been hearing about i know a lot of you are outraged about this i'm outraged , too it s hard to understand that a company that is relying on extraordinary assistance from taxpayers to keep its doors open would be paying anyone lavish bonuses it goes against our most basic sense of what is fair and what is right it offends our values but these bonuses , outrageous as they are , are a symptom of a much larger problem and that is the system and culture that made them possible a culture where people made enormous sums for taking irresponsible risks that have now put the whole economy at risk so we are going to do everything we can to deal with these specific bonuses but what s just as important is that we make sure we do n't find ourselves in this situation again , where taxpayers are on the hook for losses in bad times and all the wealth generated in good times goes to those at the very top that is the kind of ethic we 've had for too long that is the kind of approach that led us into this mess and that is something we have to change if we 're truly going to turn our economy around and move this country forward so i am absolutely committed to ensuring that we have the tools we need to prevent the kinds of abuses that sent aig spiraling and i am also committed to ensuring that if we ever do have to intervene again to prevent a bankruptcy that could be catastrophic for the whole financial system , we will have some of the tools that a bankruptcy judge has to help renegotiate contracts to sell off insolvent parts of an institution and protect healthy parts and to protect depositors , creditors , and other consumers we also want to do this because it serves the most important goal we have today , which is to rebuild our economy in a way that is consistent with our values an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility , not highflying finance schemes an economy that is built on a strong foundation , but not one that s propelled by overheated housing markets and maxedout credit cards in other words , we want to build an economy that offers prosperity for the longrun , not the bubbleandburst economy we 've experienced in recent years , where a relative few do spectacularly well while the middle class loses ground you know what i'm talking about i do n't need to tell you these are challenging times i do n't need to tell you this because you 're living it every day one out of every ten californians is out of work you 've got one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation and budget cuts are threatening the jobs of thousands of teachers across this state but here s what i want you to know we are not only going to make it through this crisis , we are going to come out on the other side a stronger and more prosperous nation i ca n't tell you how long it will take or what obstacles we will face along the way , but i can promise you this there will be brighter days ahead we 're already seeing signs of progress because of the recovery act that your two outstanding senators , senator feinstein and senator boxer worked so hard to pass and that i signed into law the other week , a new hospital will be built at camp pendleton that will give our servicemen and women the care they deserve over in inglewood , the police department is planning to expand its staff by thirty people and orange county is hoping to add a new lane on sr91 , creating about 2 , 000 jobs , and easing congestion in the process these are just a few of the 396 , 000 jobs we will create or save in california and the 35 million jobs we will create or save across america over the next two years we are also taking unprecedented steps to unlock our frozen credit markets so families can get the loans they need to buy a home or a car and businesses can pay for inventory or make payroll that s why earlier this week , we took a sweeping step to free up loans for entrepreneurs , helping them start and grow the small businesses that employ half our private sector workers that s why we are creating a fund that will help support up to 1 trillion in loans , including auto loans and college loans and that s why we 've launched a housing plan that will help responsible homeowners save money by refinancing their mortgage loans none of this will make any difference , however , unless we strengthen our economy over the longterm unless we put our economy on a firmer footing by rebuilding its foundation and that s exactly the purpose of the budget i'm submitting to congress it s a budget that makes hard choices about where to save and where to spend because of the massive deficit we inherited and the cost of this financial crisis , we are going through our books line by line so that we can cut our deficit in half by the end of my first term and reduce it by 2 trillion over the next decade but what we will not cut are investments that will lead to real growth and real prosperity investments that will make a difference in the lives of this generation and future generations because spiraling health care costs are crushing families , dragging down our entire economy , and represent one of the fastest growing parts of our budget , we 've made an historic commitment to health care reform in this budget reform that brings us closer to the day when health care is affordable and accessible for every single american because we know that countries that outeducate us today will outcompete us tomorrow , this budget invests in a complete and competitive education for every american in early childhood education programs that work in high standards and accountability in our schools and in finally putting the dream of a college degree or technical training within reach for anyone who wants it because we know that enhancing america s competitiveness will also require reducing our dependence on foreign oil and building a clean energy economy , this budget will spark the transformation we need to create green jobs and launch renewable energy companies right here in california it makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy , and it invests in technologies like wind power and solar power and fuelefficient cars and trucks , powered by batteries like the ones i 'll be seeing in rosemead tomorrow all of which will also help combat climate change that s what this budget does here s what it does not do it does not raise the taxes of any family making less than 250 , 000 by a single dime in fact , 95 of all working families will receive a tax cut a tax cut as a result of our recovery plan now , there are those who say these plans are too ambitious that we should be trying to do less , not more well , i say our challenges are too large to ignore the cost of our health care is too high to ignore our dependence on oil is too dangerous to ignore our education deficit is too wide to ignore to kick these problems down the road for another four years or eight years would be to continue the same irresponsibility that led us to this point and i did not run for president to pass on our problems to the next generation i ran for president to solve them so i know some folks in washington and on wall street are saying we should focus on only one problem at a time and i understand the thinking behind that it 'd be nice if we could pick and choose what problems to face and when to face them but that s just not the way it works you do n't get to choose between paying your mortgage bills or your medical bills you do n't get to choose between paying your kids' tuition and saving enough for retirement you need to take on all of these problems and you need a government that will do the same that s what leadership is all about and that s what this debate on the budget is all about it s about whether we are willing to do what needs to be done not only to get our economy moving right now , but to put it on the road to lasting , shared prosperity it can be easy to lose sight of this it s easy for pundits to get on tv , put their ratings ahead of their own sense of responsibility , and oversimplify what s at stake it can be difficult to break free from the partisanship that s held sway in washington for so many years but that is what we have to do that is what this moment requires for what all of you know deep down and what folks in washington sometimes forget is that in the end , a budget is not merely numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs it is about your lives , your families , and your dreams for the future and you did n't send us to washington to stand in the way of your aspirations you did n't send us there to say no to change you sent us there to get things done and that is exactly what i intend to do but i cannot do it without you , the american people that s why i'm here today because it will take all of us talking with one another and all of us working together to see our nation through this difficult time and bring about a brighter day so , thank you for this opportunity to speak with you , and now i 'd like to open it up for questions
dublin it sits in boardedup disgrace next to the river liffey , an abandoned , halffinished hulk in better days , it was conceived as the new headquarters of the powerful anglo irish bank , a glorious symbol of s great economic boom but the bank , larded with bad debt and disgraced by allegations of mismanagement , was taken over by the government last winter the site s developer went bust this fall and the ghostly construction project , mired in lawsuits , now stands as a monument to a telling kind of failure , the kind measured by the distance between the heights of a country s financial hubris and the depths of its fall not that anyone here needs any reminding that ireland , once one of the world s biggest economic success stories , is now one of the recession s worst casualties a lot of buildings are like this in dublin , said bernadette rowley , 53 , pausing wearily the other day under the shelter of the temporary pedestrian walkway at the site , as rain dripped through its cracks on wednesday , the government added to the general misery in this shellshocked city by releasing its harshest budget in generations the spending plan , 60 billion euros or about 88 billion , cuts 4 billion euros from the country s ballooning deficit by reducing public sector salaries by 5 to 15 percent and by drastically reducing expenditures on health care , education , welfare benefits and other social programs economists applauded the move , saying that ireland unlike other crisisstricken european countries , most notably greece and spain was showing courage in trying to rein in its deficit rules require countries that use the euro to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gross domestic product left unchecked , the government says , ireland s would increase to 135 percent in 2010 ireland already cut some benefits , increased some taxes , and reduced public sector salaries in emergency measures in april if the government s proposals pass parliament , it expects to save 15 billion euros or about 22 billion over the next four years this process started in 2008 , but today is a big moment for ireland in its efforts to restore stability to its public finances , dermot o'leary , chief economist for goodbody stockbrokers in dublin , said in an interview the events of the last two weeks and greece have proved that if you 're a small country with a large deficit , the markets will force you into action by driving up the rates at which you can borrow funds markets are one thing the reality for actual residents of ireland is another a number of them converged outside the parliament building to protest as the government unveiled its budget public sector employees held strikes in november the national police force has threatened to walk out it seems impossible to find anyone here who has been left unscathed never mind the national deficit , said leo lalor , who owns the bags in the city luggage store in a downtown shopping center what about his own deficit \? business at his location dropped 15 percent in 2008 , he said , and fell 30 percent further in 2009 last year , mr lalor was the general manager of a luggage company with 42 stores across ireland the banks were throwing money around like confetti , he said , until they were n't the credit line dried up virtually overnight the company went bankrupt in his new job , he makes 30 percent of his old salary he has been in retail for 30 years , he said , even through the dark days of the 1980s , and has never seen anything like this as he spoke , crowds thronged the shopping center and jingle bell rock played on what seemed to be an eternal loop despite the seasonal trappings , the stores looked as if they had bypassed christmas , moving directly into postholiday sales at a dunnes food store , wine was selling at half price at hughes hughes , four books were selling for the price of three unemployment is at 125 percent , nearly triple what it was in 2004 housing prices , fueled by a construction boom encouraged by the banks and the government , have fallen by 26 percent since their peak two years ago the country is experiencing , or a decline in price levels in the short term , this seems like a good thing because people have so much less money to spend , between pay cuts , benefits cuts and the cost of paying mortgages and creditcard bills in some ways , ireland is being thrown back into the past anyone over 35 remembers the 1980s , said kevin williams , who was waiting for his wife at the shopping center that was before the celtic tiger , before the geyser of foreign investment , before a population that used to be thrifty began believing that anything was possible , as long as you had a credit card mr williams , 50 , a civil servant in the agriculture department , had an annual salary of 44 , 000 euros in 2008 , or about 65 , 000 at current exchange rates in april , the government imposed a pension levy on public sector employees , effectively reducing his salary by 7 percent under the new budget , his pay would be cut by some 6 percent more public sector employees who earn higher salaries face steeper cuts , including the prime minister , brian cowen , whose pay is being reduced by 20 percent wednesday s budget would also impose a carbon tax of 15 euros a ton , or about 22 , on fuel but one bright spot , at least for a population that likes to drink , was the reduction in excise duty on beer and liquor this is to help stem the trend of people driving to northern ireland to buy cheaper alcohol there in parliament , brian lenihan , the finance minister , contended that the worst was over further corrections will be needed in the coming years , but none as big as today s , he said
the president hello , everybody ! thank you thank you thank you , everybody all right , everybody go ahead and have a seat how is everybody doing today \? \( applause \) how about tim spicer \? \( applause \) i am here with students at wakefield high school in arlington , virginia and we 've got students tuning in from all across america , from kindergarten through 12th grade and i am just so glad that all could join us today and i want to thank wakefield for being such an outstanding host give yourselves a big round of applause \( applause \) i know that for many of you , today is the first day of school and for those of you in kindergarten , or starting middle or high school , it s your first day in a new school , so it s understandable if you 're a little nervous i imagine there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty good right now \( applause \) with just one more year to go and no matter what grade you 're in , some of you are probably wishing it were still summer and you could 've stayed in bed just a little bit longer this morning i know that feeling when i was young , my family lived overseas i lived in indonesia for a few years and my mother , she did n't have the money to send me where all the american kids went to school , but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an american education so she decided to teach me extra lessons herself , monday through friday but because she had to go to work , the only time she could do it was at 4 30 in the morning now , as you might imagine , i was n't too happy about getting up that early and a lot of times , i 'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table but whenever i 'd complain , my mother would just give me one of those looks and she 'd say , this is no picnic for me either , buster \( laughter \) so i know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school but i'm here today because i have something important to discuss with you i'm here because i want to talk with you about your education and what s expected of all of you in this new school year now , i 've given a lot of speeches about education and i 've talked about responsibility a lot i 've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn i 've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track , and you get your homework done , and do n't spend every waking hour in front of the tv or with the xbox i 've talked a lot about your government s responsibility for setting high standards , and supporting teachers and principals , and turning around schools that are n't working , where students are n't getting the opportunities that they deserve but at the end of the day , we can have the most dedicated teachers , the most supportive parents , the best schools in the world and none of it will make a difference , none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities , unless you show up to those schools , unless you pay attention to those teachers , unless you listen to your parents and grandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed that s what i want to focus on today the responsibility each of you has for your education i want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself every single one of you has something that you 're good at every single one of you has something to offer and you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is that s the opportunity an education can provide maybe you could be a great writer maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper but you might not know it until you write that english paper that english class paper that s assigned to you maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor maybe even good enough to come up with the next iphone or the new medicine or vaccine but you might not know it until you do your project for your science class maybe you could be a mayor or a senator or a supreme court justice but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team and no matter what you want to do with your life , i guarantee that you 'll need an education to do it you want to be a doctor , or a teacher , or a police officer \? you want to be a nurse or an architect , a lawyer or a member of our military \? you 're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers you cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job you 've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it and this is n't just important for your own life and your own future what you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country the future of america depends on you what you 're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future you 'll need the knowledge and problemsolving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and aids , and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment you 'll need the insights and criticalthinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness , crime and discrimination , and make our nation more fair and more free you 'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy we need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect so you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems if you do n't do that if you quit on school you 're not just quitting on yourself , you 're quitting on your country now , i know it s not always easy to do well in school i know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork i get it i know what it s like my father left my family when i was two years old , and i was raised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills and was n't always able to give us the things that other kids had there were times when i missed having a father in my life there were times when i was lonely and i felt like i did n't fit in so i was n't always as focused as i should have been on school , and i did some things i'm not proud of , and i got in more trouble than i should have and my life could have easily taken a turn for the worse but i was i was lucky i got a lot of second chances , and i had the opportunity to go to college and law school and follow my dreams my wife , our first lady michelle obama , she has a similar story neither of her parents had gone to college , and they did n't have a lot of money but they worked hard , and she worked hard , so that she could go to the best schools in this country some of you might not have those advantages maybe you do n't have adults in your life who give you the support that you need maybe someone in your family has lost their job and there s not enough money to go around maybe you live in a neighborhood where you do n't feel safe , or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know are n't right but at the end of the day , the circumstances of your life what you look like , where you come from , how much money you have , what you 've got going on at home none of that is an excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school that s no excuse for talking back to your teacher , or cutting class , or dropping out of school there is no excuse for not trying where you are right now does n't have to determine where you 'll end up no one s written your destiny for you , because here in america , you write your own destiny you make your own future that s what young people like you are doing every day , all across america young people like jazmin perez , from roma , texas jazmin did n't speak english when she first started school neither of her parents had gone to college but she worked hard , earned good grades , and got a scholarship to brown university is now in graduate school , studying public health , on her way to becoming dr jazmin perez i'm thinking about andoni schultz , from los altos , california , who s fought brain cancer since he was three he s had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries , one of which affected his memory , so it took him much longer hundreds of extra hours to do his schoolwork but he never fell behind he s headed to college this fall and then there s shantell steve , from my hometown of chicago , illinois even when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city , she managed to get a job at a local health care center , start a program to keep young people out of gangs , and she s on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college and jazmin , andoni , and shantell are n't any different from any of you they face challenges in their lives just like you do in some cases they 've got it a lot worse off than many of you but they refused to give up they chose to take responsibility for their lives , for their education , and set goals for themselves and i expect all of you to do the same that s why today i'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education and do everything you can to meet them your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework , paying attention in class , or spending some time each day reading a book maybe you 'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity , or volunteer in your community maybe you 'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look , because you believe , like i do , that all young people deserve a safe environment to study and learn maybe you 'll decide to take better care of yourself so you can be more ready to learn and along those lines , by the way , i hope all of you are washing your hands a lot , and that you stay home from school when you do n't feel well , so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter but whatever you resolve to do , i want you to commit to it i want you to really work at it i know that sometimes you get that sense from tv that you can be rich and successful without any hard work that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality tv star chances are you 're not going to be any of those things the truth is , being successful is hard you wo n't love every subject that you study you wo n't click with every teacher that you have not every homework assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right at this minute and you wo n't necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try that s okay some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who 've had the most failures jk rowling s who wrote harry potter her first harry potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally published michael jordan was cut from his high school basketball team he lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career but he once said , i have failed over and over and over again in my life and that s why i succeed these people succeeded because they understood that you ca n't let your failures define you you have to let your failures teach you you have to let them show you what to do differently the next time so if you get into trouble , that does n't mean you 're a troublemaker , it means you need to try harder to act right if you get a bad grade , that does n't mean you 're stupid , it just means you need to spend more time studying no one s born being good at all things you become good at things through hard work you 're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport you do n't hit every note the first time you sing a song you 've got to practice the same principle applies to your schoolwork you might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right you might have to read something a few times before you understand it you definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it s good enough to hand in do n't be afraid to ask questions do n't be afraid to ask for help when you need it i do that every day asking for help is n't a sign of weakness , it s a sign of strength because it shows you have the courage to admit when you do n't know something , and that then allows you to learn something new so find an adult that you trust a parent , a grandparent or teacher , a coach or a counselor and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals and even when you 're struggling , even when you 're discouraged , and you feel like other people have given up on you , do n't ever give up on yourself , because when you give up on yourself , you give up on your country the story of america is n't about people who quit when things got tough it s about people who kept going , who tried harder , who loved their country too much to do anything less than their best it s the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago , and went on to wage a revolution and they founded this nation young people students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a depression and won a world war who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded google and twitter and facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other so today , i want to ask all of you , what s your contribution going to be \? what problems are you going to solve \? what discoveries will you make \? what will a president who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country \? now , your families , your teachers , and i are doing everything we can to make sure you have the education you need to answer these questions i'm working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn but you 've got to do your part , too so i expect all of you to get serious this year i expect you to put your best effort into everything you do i expect great things from each of you so do n't let us down do n't let your family down or your country down most of all , do n't let yourself down make us all proud thank you very much , everybody god bless you god bless america thank you \( applause \)
on the day the took the field in the gleaming new house that has already stirred debate about the real estate boom and bust , the sun broke through earlyday clouds , derek jeter gave the new digs a firm thumbsup and a steinbrenner \( hal \) answered the ceremonial first question about the manager s job security this is kind of an optimistic time right now i have n't even thought of it , steinbrenner , who inherited the title general partner from his dad , the boss , said after a midafternoon workout but he went on to mouth big george s organizational mantra anything less than winning the world series would be considered a failure that ought to make the seat in joe girardi s stateoftheart office feel familiarly hot across the street from the hallowed grounds , inside the new ballpark , you could n't shake the feeling that the original had given birth to a genetically engineered child the decorative facade stretches tastefully around the top of the soaring upper deck , as it did in the original stadium the 31 , 000squarefoot great hall between the exterior wall and the stadium interior is almost spatially disorienting an especially nice touch is the glimpse of the no 4 train rumbling by in the small opening between the otherwise majestic decked stands and the bleachers in right in an enclosed outfield overloaded with corporate signage the only missing piece of franchise grandiosity was no 13 at third base rest assured , alex rodriguez will return and , like the new yankee stadium , will be even larger than he was in his previous life nobody was more attached to the old stadium than jeter , but he came into the interview room \( more of an assembly , actually \) after hitting his first battingpractice pitch over the fence , and called the new place a palace it looks like the old stadium unless you look into the stands the stands are a lot bigger , he said is bigger necessarily better \? johnny damon , whose best years were spent in the intimacy of fenway park , said that depends in boston , there is n't much land to expand , but it s still fenway , still a pretty incredible place , he said we were fortunate to get those parks he meant the centralized parkland that the less fortunate neighborhood no longer has , thanks to the cooperation of municipal politicians but there is no doubt that the roughly 4 million fans who visit yankee stadium this season will appreciate the splendor of the throwback outer shell , the roomy concourses , the expanded cushioned seats , the multiple concession options that include calorie counts next to every item on the menu factoring most prices \( 10 for a beer in a souvenir cup \) , that may be the most reliable deterrent in maintaining some level of recessionary cost control the other obvious choice would be an obstructed 5 seat on a bench in the bleachers , where television screens have been built into a dividing wall that will allow fans to follow the ball as it rolls between damon in left and brett gardner in center no question , this is an impressive stadium but when the broadcaster john sterling told assorted guests outside the partnering hard rock cafe to go take a look at the playing field because it will take your breath away , i thought , well , the old stadium did a pretty fair job of that , too mets fans walking into for the first time should be bowled over by the conversion from dowdy shea , but yankees fans have n't exactly been sitting in the city dump since 1923 the new yankee stadium is not about improved atmosphere it is about amenities and there are many but in the context of new york s fiscal reality , are they worth what was taken from the neighborhood folk , the taxpayer subsidies and the unholy prices of the premium seats , a fair number of which remain available \? i think if anybody in any business had known where the economy was going to go , they would have done things differently , hal steinbrenner said there s no doubt that small amounts of our tickets might be overpriced while no doubt and might were n't quite the right word match , at least steinbrenner admitted to the unsold seats that stand to create pockets of blue reminders of overreaching are the yankees' problem but the steinbrenners have what they long wanted , while the players have computer screens at their dressing stalls inside a mall of a clubhouse that has a kitchen with two chefs , among places where reporters wo n't roam when the yankees rolled into the south bronx by bus wednesday night , the young lefty reliever phil coke could n't believe his eyes when he saw the two stadiums , sidebyside , lit up i 've never experienced anything like that before , he said of course , the demolition of the old stadium is overdue the neighborhood deserves at least some of its precious parkland back now that the house george m steinbrenner built with the help of the willing and the unwilling is officially open for business i would have to think that it s second to none , jeter said or just what the steinbrenners always demand of their yankees
santa fe , nm the conversations inside one adobewalled office after another in s state capital could be summarized in two words he s back some said it with pleasure , some with irritation , some with such caution that they tried to let their voices betray no emotion gov s withdrawal on sunday as the choice for commerce secretary in an obama cabinet brings an outsize political personality back to a small town in a small state , both of which had already begun planning to proceed without him everyone was thinking he would be gone , said michael sanchez , the majority leader of the state senate , which , like much of the political establishment in this state of about 2 million people , is controlled by democrats it is what it is , added mr sanchez , whose caucus in the senate has been increasingly at odds with mr richardson in recent years mr richardson has dominated state government by force of personality and a singleminded pursuit of economic development and raising the state s profile along with his own but now , things are not quite the same a federal investigation is looking into pay for play accusations involving a state financial contract given to a company run by a donor to the governor s political action committees while denying any involvement , mr richardson said the inquiry would have forced an untenable delay in his confirmation as commerce secretary but with the recent convictions on corruption charges of three officials who had held high state posts two former state treasurers and the former speaker pro tem of the state senate the federal investigation is being carefully watched by the politicians and power brokers with whom mr richardson has dealt in the past most politicians called for comment by reporters on monday spoke cautiously , if at all the governor himself , in a brief news conference at the state capitol on monday and in a roundrobin letter to members of the political and legal community , affirmed his statement that i acted properly and my administration acted appropriately in connection with the two contracts the contracts , worth 14 million , were to cdr financial products , a beverly hills , calif , company at the news conference , mr richardson said he was disappointed in the turn of events there were a lot of things in which i thought i could help the country in a time of financial crisis , he said sometimes your own dreams and plans must take a back seat to what is best for the nation heath haussamen , a former state capitol reporter for two new mexico newspapers who now writes a blog , said in an interview monday , we 've been dealing with scandal after scandal it s been a big mess of mr richardson mr haussamen said we call him the teflon governor we 've all written a lot of stories about pay to play , and none of them have stuck he plays the political game at a higher level than pretty much anyone in the state s history and does it very successfully the governor s biggest successes have come in the area of economic development one project , a 400 million rail line between santa fe and albuquerque that opened last month , was marred by a political dustup when it was disclosed that one station involved a land swap with a politically powerful developer and major richardson contributor economic development projects have also included lowering state taxes for movie companies willing to film in new mexico a move that helped attract projects like no country for old men and the inclusion of large new mexico floats in the annual rose parade in pasadena james b alley jr , a lawyer who said he was friendly with the governor , interrupted his lunch at tia sophia , a luncheonette popular with politicians , to say he was disappointed that mr richardson s commerce post had fallen through in spite of all the warts all politicians have , mr alley said , i think he 'd have done a good job in washington but mr sanchez , the state senator , said the governor s successes had come in years when the state was flush with revenues from the oil , natural gas and mining industries new mexico must now cut or tax its way out of a deficit of about 450 million on a budget of about 6 billion john grubesic , a lawyer and former state senator who fell out with the governor after he wrote an oped article that referred to him as the flabby king , said mr richardson demanded loyalty and was quick to turn on those who disagreed with him part of the governor s style is he s very hard charging and he can sometimes be seen as a bully , mr grubesic said people are very reluctant to think outside of richardson s box on saturday , when mr richardson still seemed to be a shorttimer , a photograph of diane denish , the lieutenant governor , was prominently featured on the front page of the santa fe new mexican under the headline out of the shadow two days later , mr richardson was talking about how he looked forward with her as his lieutenant governor santa fe residents outside

off like half the population
more than half of the nation s unemployed workers have borrowed money from friends or relatives since losing their jobs an equal number have cut back on doctor visits or medical treatments because they are out of work almost half have suffered from depression or about 4 in 10 parents have noticed behavioral changes in their children that they attribute to their difficulties in finding work joblessness has wreaked financial and emotional havoc on the lives of many of those out of work , according to a new york times cbs news poll of unemployed adults , causing major life changes , issues and trouble maintaining even basic necessities the results of the poll , which surveyed 708 unemployed adults from dec 5 to dec 10 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points , help to lay bare the depth of the trauma experienced by millions across the country who are out of work as the jobless rate hovers at 10 percent and , in particular , as the ranks of the longterm unemployed soar roughly half of the respondents described the as a hardship that had caused fundamental changes in their lives generally , those who have been out of work longer reported experiencing more acute financial and emotional effects i lost my job in march , and from there on , everything went downhill , said vicky newton , 38 , of mount pleasant , mich , a single mother who had been a customerservice representative in an insurance agency after struggling and struggling and not being able to pay my house payments or my other bills , i finally sucked up my pride , she said in an interview after the poll was conducted i got food stamps just to help feed my daughter over the summer , she abandoned her home in flint , mich , after she started receiving foreclosure notices she now lives 90 minutes away , in a rental house owned by her father with unemployment driving foreclosures nationwide , a quarter of those polled said they had either lost their home or been threatened with foreclosure or eviction for not paying their mortgage or rent about a quarter , like ms newton , have received food stamps more than half said they had cut back on both luxuries and

emotional issues tammy linville , 29 , of louisville , ky , said she lost her job as a clerical worker for the census bureau a year and a half ago she began seeing a therapist for depression every week through but recently has not been able to go because her car broke down and she cannot afford to fix it her partner works at the ford plant in the area , but his schedule has been sporadic they have two small children and at this point , she said , they are saving quarters for diapers every time i think about money , i shut down because there is none , ms linville said i get major i just do n't know what we 're going to do nearly half of the adults surveyed admitted to feeling embarrassed or ashamed most of the time or sometimes as a result of being out of work perhaps unsurprisingly , given the traditional image of men as breadwinners , men were significantly more likely than women to report feeling ashamed most of the time there was a pervasive sense from the poll that the american dream had been upended for many nearly half of those polled said they felt in danger of falling out of their social class , with those out of work six months or more feeling especially vulnerable workingclass respondents felt at risk in the greatest numbers nearly half of respondents said they did not have , with the vast majority citing job loss as a reason , a notable finding given the tug of war in congress over a health care overhaul the poll offered a glimpse of the potential ripple effect of having no coverage more than half characterized the cost of basic medical care as a hardship many in the ranks of the unemployed appear to be rethinking their career and life choices just over 40 percent said they had moved or considered moving to another part of the state or country where there were more jobs more than twothirds of respondents had considered changing their career or field , and 44 percent of those surveyed had pursued job retraining or other educational opportunities joe whitlow , 31 , of nashville , worked as a mechanic until a repair shop he was running with a friend finally petered out in august he had contemplated going back to school before , but the potential loss in income always deterred him now he is enrolled at a local community college , planning to study accounting when everything went bad , not that i did n't have a choice , but it made the choice easier , mr whitlow said the poll also shed light on the formal and informal safety nets that the jobless have relied upon more than half said they were receiving or had received unemployment benefits but 61 percent of those receiving benefits said the amount was not enough to cover basic necessities meanwhile , a fifth said they had received food from a nonprofit organization or religious institution among those with a working spouse , half said their spouse had taken on additional hours or another job to help make ends meet even those who have stayed employed have not escaped the recession s bite according to a new york times cbs news nationwide poll conducted at the same time as the poll of unemployed adults , about 3 in 10 people said that in the past year , as a result of bad economic conditions , their pay had been cut in terms of casting blame for the high unemployment rate , 26 percent of unemployed adults cited former president george w bush 12 percent pointed the finger at banks 8 percent highlighted jobs going overseas and the same number blamed politicians only 3 percent blamed president obama those out of work were split , however , on the president s handling of job creation , with 47 percent expressing approval and 44 percent disapproval unemployed americans are divided over what the future holds for the job market 39 percent anticipate improvement , 36 percent expect it will stay the same , and 22 percent say it will get worse

the tony awards , broadway s top theater honors , artsbeat live blogged the ceremony di nph closes with a parody of tonight some sample lyrics elton s billy was all the rage what class , what drive , now angela won five and she hooked up with poison backstage and this show could not be gayer if liza was named mayor and elton john took flight \( that parody was written by marc shaiman and scott wittman , of course \) ci a great , funny ending to a pretty terrific show i could have done without the extraneous touring numbers and , obviously , there were some technical glitches who would have thought an 80s rocker would get in trouble at the tonys \? but overall it was a big improvement on last year , i thought di the tonys are always efficient , to say the least ci and when was the last time you actually wanted to hear more from an awards host \? neil patrick harris was completely charming di he was very subtle and very selfeffacing the antiwhoopi i was wishing for maybe one big surprise win but if everyone s still talking about bret michaels tomorrow , i guess that s a successful show \( steven mcelroy reports neil patrick harris got the biggest press room applause of the night for that closing number \) ci yes , it was as short on surprises as any awards show in memory but i would not want to have been surprised by a loss for , say , alice ripley or the billys best live performance next to normal , runnerup west side story what did you like \? di i wasn t as enamored of the west side story performance not a bad performance , just didn t think it translated well to tv but i thought the billy elliot and next to normal performances were both tremendous those sequences , as much as the actual awards , will put some skin in the theater seats and what else can you say about nph \? do they need a host for the emmys \? di get ready , charles i think we re coming back to more liza ! and the tony award for best musical goes to billy elliot liza , for one , is pretty happy about that result \( so are the ballet girls you d think they spotted the jonas brothers in the audience \) charles , you re being suspiciously quiet ci i m waiting for the finale di since nobody asked the youngest tony winners of all time are frankie michaels \( who was 10 in 1966 when he won for mame \) and daisy egan \( who was 12 in 1991 when she won for the secret garden \) di audra mcdonald presents the award for best performance by a leading actor in a musical the three billys are already leaning into the aisles , a little bit the tony goes to the three billys david alvarez , trent kowalik and kiril kulish before anyone asks , they re not the youngest winners ever no one wants to go first ! it s adorable they toss their tonys nervously between their hands , like they were ipods ci overthetop adorable if they usher them off with music there will be hell to pay ! \( and of course they did \) di on the plus side , i bet they get their curfews extended tonight on the minus side , they were cut off for a performance from jersey boys ci ruins the emotional arc of the evening with another crass advertisement di neil patrick harris says coming out for the second time this month david hyde pierce he s presenting the award for best performance by a leading actress in a musical ci in 30 seconds flat di the tony goes to alice ripley , next to normal she cites john f kennedy in her victory speech i am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities , we , too , will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics , but for our contribution to the human spirit ci perhaps the most predictable winner and certainly none is more deserving di and the tony for best revival of a musical goes to hair quite the turn of events for this production  and that s a lot of hair up on that stage now ci it bloomed on broadway in a really magical way , i have to say i thought some of the magic of the central park version would be lost on the contrary it s more concentrated and moving on broadway di any predictions for next year \? in 2010 , is the award finian s rainbow to lose \? ci i wouldn t venture to guess certainly that s a charming production i hope it makes a smooth transition but other than bye bye birdie i cannot recall what s slated for next season di i think they re still taking suggestions anyone ready to mount that chess revival \? di anne hathaway introduces the cast of hair performing hair by sheer coincidence , the best musical revival award will be given immediately thereafter ci these hair folks are taking the audparticipation bit a little far i mean stay on stage please , people would it kill you \? di yeah , you go up to james gandolfini and run your fingers through his scalp i dare you di i hope the standing ovation isn t too long he s only got a minute30 to give his speech ! he recounts that when he was born , his mother s hospital room had a great view of the winter garden theater s marquee here i am , 77 years later , still on 50th street and even jerry herman gets played off ci well , it was just the last line but for that reason couldn t they let him finish \? clearly they re watching the clock an update on bret michaels a spokeswoman for the tonys tells the associated press that the singer missed his mark during the opening number \( no kidding \) she says he did not break his nose , but the extend of his injuries are not yet known back on stage , angela lansbury introduces a presentation in honor of jerry herman , the lifetime achievement tony winner steven mcelroy my television monitor indicates that my hopes for a shocking reasons to be pretty upset in the best play category have been dashed meanwhile , here in the room gregory jbara \( who won the tony for best featured actor in a musical \) is giving a very heartfelt shout out to his wife who lives in los angeles while he has been here he says he would not be here if not for her and his children he is thrilled about the win i m 47 years old and i m sure i was pretending to make one of these speeches when i as in junior high school di no need to turn down the bass that is harvey fierstein to present the award for best revival of a play and best play and the tony goes to the norman conquests charles , i believe you had a passing opinion or two about the nominees in this category ci i think joe turner was really incomparable but i loved norman too and for that matter mary stuart i hope this helps the box office of norman but it s not likely and i m glad the tony producers chose to reinstate the category on the telecast the season was all about play revivals di and the tony for best play goes to god of carnage \( good thing the carnage cast just resigned through midnovember \) yasmina reza , the playwright , dedicates the award to her mother , who overcame her fear of flying to be here tonight charles , i know part of you was pulling for dividing the estate ci all of me , really dividing the estate is such a lovely play and horton foote never won a tony but that s immaterial really a tony , like any award , is a popularity contest and rarely a measure of real accomplishment obviously the voters want to reward the big box office winner of the year \( though why , if it s such a hit , is god advertising so much on tv \? \) but actually yasmina reza gave a lovely speech geoffrey rush is gamely answering questions while many of the reporters are instead watching marcia gay harden win her tony on the television monitors , reports steven mcelroy he said when he first accepted the role in exit the king , he thought it would be like eating spinach , good to do because it s an important play , but he wasn t sure it d be all that much fun of course , he later changed his mind about the fun part di elton john introduces the angry dance from billy elliot , beginning with trent kowalik in the title role ci this number is not the best advertisement for the show , i have to say but then they ve already done the aerial bit di i would not want to be the legally blonde cast that has to follow this from steven mcelroy reports karen olivo is here now , and she reiterates that yes indeed she is overwhelmed , or at least shocked i m completely surprised , she said i did that horrible thing and read the polls , but i guess i read the wrong ones di they somehow found a scene from neil labute s reasons to be pretty fit for broadcast television \( it was about 10 seconds long \) frank langella \( another overlooked potential nominee \) is on hand to present best performance by a leading actress in a play he reminds the nominating committee that he did appear on broadway they must have been out of town for our fourmonth sold out run and i thought geoffrey rush was nice in that play ci wonderfully dry perhaps the funniest riff of the night di the camera showed the wrong actresses during mr langella s reading of the names of the nominees janet mcteer and harriet walter were mixed up but the tony goes to marcia gay harden i will say that some in this office thought it might go to jane fonda but marcia gay harden was dynamite in that role ci how fastidious and classy of marcia gay harden to correct the camera error in her speech di how could they play her off \? they owe her a few extra seconds for the shoutouts to the mary stuart actresses di for anyone who missed it \( like me \) , here s video of bret michaels s inadvertent headbanging in the opening number  steven mcelroy reports you ll never guess who i just bumped into by the elevators ! liza minnelli herself she introduced me to ron lewis , her director and choreographer ms minnelli said she really expected to hear the name , will ferrell when this winner was announced i was all ready to stand up and cheer him on , she said this year s in memoriam segment acknowledged many broadway greats , including natasha richardson , gerald schoenfeld , harold pinter , horton foote , eartha kitt , bea arthur and paul newman di the tony award for best performance by a leading actor in a play goes to geoffrey rush , exit the king he says french existential absurdist tragicomedy rocks charles , i noticed you had said ra l esparza should win for speedtheplow ci yes but geoffrey rush s performance certainly was impressive i had some objecions to the whole tone of exit the king , and raul esparza has been overlooked before his time will come no doubt di first sushi joke of the night ! nph chows down onstage \( jeremy piven , we ll see you in arbitration this week \) di enter carrie fisher ! \( introducing the next to normal production number , of all things \) alice ripley and j robert spencer are performing you don t know from next to normal and it s rocking harder than rock of ages watch out for the silverware in those front rows ! for one year , couldn t they just have awards for best musical and secondbest musical \? ci a nice contrast to the allsplash numbers from the other musicals and an intimate scene like that fits the screen better than a big chorus dance number not that there are any in next to normal di the show does translate remarkably well to television alice ripley gave the best performance on last week s tonys concert show \( hopefully floating around on youtube , somewhere \) di john stamos uncle jesse himself is here to present the featured actor in a musical award the tony goes to gregory jbara , billy elliot a very well earned award would love to know the voting totals , though i bet it was a close race ci it was a terrific performance , and a moving acceptance speech , too di and the tony for best performance by a featured actress in a musical goes to karen olivo , west side story another well earned win and she totally carried that in the heights documentary she s genuinely overwhelmed guess we ll get the rest of that in the press room ci they are running through the list of the creative arts tonys as opposed to the uncreative ones well , they have got to call them something other than the nontelevisionairtimeworthy tonys di it was exciting to have that tie in the best orchestrations category for the 10 of us who were watching on the web cast the lucky tv viewers got andy rooney , i think steven mcelroy matthew warchus , who won for god of carnage , thought he was probably going to win for that other one , like probably a lot of us did i was a bit surprised that god of carnage got it because norman conquests is three plays and usually directors get this \( holding up his tony \) for doing big things , like moving a lot of scenery around , he said he didn t think what he did on god of carnage would be obvious enough of an achievement to gain him a tony di more audio woes befall guys and dolls as they begin sit down , you re rockin the boat ci oh dear , another microphone gaffe well at least now they are prepared di maybe it was meant to recreate the audio of the period \? interesting that they chose the number that doesn t feature either oliver platt or lauren graham , no \? ci well , sit down is maybe the best 11 o clock number in musical theater hard to not do it that said , i could do without the celestialvisions video , an unfortunate aspect of a mostly unfortunate production di and the tony for best special theatrical event goes to liza s at the palace ci oh gee i was pulling for the chinese acrobats di better luck next year , slava s snowshow di doing her best impression of liza minnelli liza minnelli this is exquisite , she says no way there s a dry eye in that house steven mcelroy here are tom kitt and brian yorkey , of next to normal whether or not this is truly a surprise is up for debate , but they say that it was we never intended to be standing here before you with tony awards , mr yorkey said we intended to write the best show we could oh , and now i get to watch this rock of ages bit ! awesome ! di here s the number you were really waiting for the rock of ages montage it s i want to rock paradise don t stop believing \( for those who didn t live through the hair rock era \) mitchell jarvis dares to approach liza at her throne he calls her a tonynominated freak machine the crowd has been given their glowinthedark lighters in advance ci are you waving yours , dave \? di i could hear don t stop believing on an accordion and it would still make me tear up a little di am i cynical to think that these commercials for the antidepressant cymbalta are secretly a plug for next to normal \? ci see the show and get the prescription \? we should not joke , of course in fact what s impressive about the broadway transfer of that musical , i think , is how it moved away from humor to fully explore the darker depths of the material best direction of a musical 9 pm di and the tony for best direction of a musical goes to stephen daldry , billy elliot he seems to have lost his place in the list of names he memorized ahead of time ci yes but them brits are so cool they are gracious even when flustered mildly flustered di and here s susan sarandon to mediate the warchus v warchus dispute \( a k a the award for best direction of a play \) and the tony goes to matthew warchus , god of carnage ci that s a little surprising i predicted the other matthew , since norman conquests is such an epictype show \( though not epic feeling \) but the tony voters really went all out to nominate god of carnage i was shocked it wasn t included in the best musical lineup steven mcelroy reports roger robinson is staying much longer than anyone else so far , and why not \? it s his first tony win in a career that began off broadway in 1963 he talked about performing for the president , pointing out that it hasn t been so long since a black man would not have been allowed to even sit in the orchestra of that theater this award is really special because a lot of your peers vote , he said they really know their stuff steven mcelroy reports angela lansbury is here , to a lot of applause did she say on tv that she thought her win was not fair \? here she says it was a surprise and a thrill to be allowed to come back to broadway at this time in my life she has now tied the record for the most tonys , along with julie harris i am very lucky and happy to be there along with her , with five tonys but will she try to actually break the record \? i go where the work is oftentimes and i feel there are some roles i can still play while she was chatting i missed seeing the bit from west side story di linmanuel miranda \( who wrote the spanishlanguage lyrical translation \) introduces dance at the gym from west side story no spontaneous rap from linmanuel this year , alas unfortunately , the spectacle of this number is not quite translating to tv ci actually i disagree i think the producers were smart to showcase that number it s one of the highlights of the production that s the best five minutes of musical theater on the show so far , i think \( aside from poison , natch \) here s will ferrell to introduce the best original score category he selfdeprecatingly refers to himself as a broadway veteran and the tony award goes to tom kitt and brian yorkey , next to normal that s about as close to an upset as we ve seen so far ci ben brantley and i both predicted this one as did many others the voters want to honor the show in some ways but it s a longshot for the top one plus i think the score for billy was not considered a highwater mark for musicaltheater composition di nph has prepared a sample broadway scratch and sniff card he declines to scratch billy elliot wisely di nph very quickly introduces the mamma mia touring cast performing dancing queen even some part of him seems to understand it s a slightly unusual thing to feature on the tonys ci really seems inappropriate and unnecessary to me mamma mia does not need the exposure but obviously the tonys telecast is now becoming more a big advertisement than a chance to honor artists work di it does seem a somewhat circular argument we need the show to focus on productions that home viewers wouldn t otherwise see so let s emphasize the shows that everyone has already heard of di james gandolfini informs us that for the record , he and shrek are no relation and the tony award for best performance by a featured actress in a play goes to angela lansbury , blithe spirit this is her fifth win \( and she got to see poison perform so what a night for her \) seriously , its wonderful to see her so genuinely moved , even after win no 5 ci i recall fondly the many years she hosted the awards with utmost graciousness and class and just today i watched her performance of bosom buddies with the late bea arthur on youtube di eddie murphy i mean , daniel breaker doing an eddie murphy impression and the shrek cast are starting their production number , what s up duloc \? with about a dozen short jokes is it wise for the tonys to feature a number that s perhaps taking potshots at disney \? i realize the show has its fans and nonfans , but i did love christopher sieber s performance his kneepads deserve an honorary tony ci it seems a little odd to me for them not to showcase the stars of the show granted we ve already seen a bit of the big secondact number but maybe they ll be back again our colleague steven mcelroy reports a parade of billy elliot winners has come through , blocking my view of liza on the screen first was rick fisher the lighting designer , then martin koch , who won for orchestrations and peter darling , the choreographer and lee hall said there has been talk of turning billy back into a movie di the tony for best performer by a featured actor in a play goes to roger robinson , joe turner s come and gone you called this one , charles our readers had overwhelmingly predicted john glover in waiting for godot on their tony ballots an early sign of the obama effect \? ci i thought this was a fairly sure bet since the show was , in my view , overlooked in terms of nominations , although it did get several wonderful speech eloquent but without feeling canned di nph makes his entrance wearing an especially shiny suit he s on a first name basis with all of us he just calls himself neil he says bret michaels performance gives headbanging a new meaning so apparently there was a performerset collision that occurred up there ci neil patrick harris is charmingly lowkey after that onslaught a relief , really shiny suit is weirdly mesmerizing di ladies and gentlemen liza ! she s performing , but the world goes round \( anne hathaway approves \) and at last the cast of hair this number might actually end on time ! the theater gods are smiling down tonight i am feeling a little more dazed than dazzled i thought someone was going to fall offstage this would seem to be a bit of protestingtoomuch wowing us a little relentlessly not to say bewilderingly di in the meantime , it s aaron tveit and stockard channing together again for the first time promptly followed by all 200 members the shrek cast let your freak flag fly an interesting tone to strike in the opening number of the tonys and here s dolly taking us into 9 to 5 it s an understated performance for her , at least dave itzkoff and here we go ! we re beginning with billy elliot , and the song electricity , performed by elton john and the three billys charles isherwood ouch sound glitch \? lovely image of billys dancing with the chairs , though di yes , we missed that first line by sir elton but he s generally ok with such things , right \? billy elliot has already won five awards coming into the broadcast and we move directly into west side story and tonight \( quintet \) and more sound troubles ci my god what is going on back there \? definite miking problems di they are sortof mashing it up with luck be a lady and then right into a rock of ages performance with brett michaels is this what leonard bernstein and frank loesser would want \? ci one can only wonder this is distinctly bizarre but at least it s not 10 minutes of lion king like last year oh my god did the lead singer of poison just almost get crushed by a bit of scenery \? or did i dream that \? di missed that ! di that opening performance , incidentally , is where we ll also see some of the biggest guns of the night dolly parton , elton john , poison they are also planning some sort of juxtaposition between west side story and guys and dolls in that number hopefully not a mashup ci surely the first time and last dolly , elton and poison will share the stage quite a hairoff between dolly and poison can t wait di i saw a brief red carpet interview with bret michaels and rikki rockett \( of poison \) they were in a festive mood we ve also been advised to stick around to the very end of the broadcast , as there will also be a closing number performed by neil patrick harris luckily , the tony awards show is not competing with the sopranos finale this year ci yes i believe the nph song is going to be written live by marc shaiman and scott wittman of hairspray vamping on what happens during the show di live songwriting ! and you thought live blogging was tough , charles di one thing we can safely predict this show is going to run more than its allotted three hours the opening number alone is budgeted for 11 minutes and 6 seconds , before neil patrick harris takes the stage they re going to work in all eight of the nominated musicals before their full production numbers during the show ci that sounds ambitious i bet the show comes in on time cbs would plotz if not but they could be pretty cruel with the scary orchestra as i believe tony kushner once called it di based on the official rundown , they have this ending at 11 04 pm and that s if everything goes according to plan which it always does , ha ha ha the tony goes to lee hall , billy elliot di it s no great surprise , though part of me was rooting for hunter bell , the book writer for title of show i know i m a hopeless dreamer ci billy has already won a few and book is the biggest but it doesn t necessarily presage a sweep next to normal was mostly sungthrough so arguably did not have a really meaty book i , too , would have been tickled if hunter bell had won di you wrote that you would have liked to see chris d arienzo , the writer of rock of ages , in the mix as well ci yes i think he did a really clever job with ahem potentially dubious material struck just the right selfmocking notes di and surely the funniest wine cooler joke in recent broadway history di there were more than a few terrific productions that were largely shut out this year as well the seagull , and desire under the elms , to name just two if you could wave your magic wand , who would you reward that was denied in the nominations \? ci carla gugino would be the first , for desire a scandalous oversight but it was , as we ve all said , a remarkably full season di indeed if you limited yourself to just the film and television stars , there would not have been enough room for them was godot underrepresented in the nominations \?

berlin herta m ller was at home in berlin when the nobel committee called to tell her that she won the highest prize in literature reporters thronged outside the redbrick apartment building in the quaint but hardly highclass neighborhood of friedenau where she lives almost immediately after the announcement thursday they rang and rang she didn t answer when a swedish reporter asked her at the press conference later that afternoon why ms m ller hadn t responded to the doorbell , she answered , because i didn t want to talk about it the whole time i can hardly do it now the selection of ms m ller thursday stunned europe and led to a flood of reactions , some very supportive but some quite harsh among those who did not seem to comprehend that ms m ller had just won , you could certainly count ms m ller herself the first words out of her mouth were , i still don t believe it yet i know it , but still don t quite believe it while critics praised her work far and wide , there was also an undercurrent of astonishment that another relative unknown had taken home the big prize the prominent german literary critic marcel reichranicki declined to comment on her award at all , telling reporters simply , i don t want to talk about her my mantra is always that philip roth should get the prize , the critic hellmuth karasek told the german news agency dpa , adding and once again it wasn t him , though he offered strong praise for ms m ller s latest book , comparing her to aleksandr i solzhenitsyn the french news agency afp caught up with the last german winner of the nobel for literature , g nter grass , who declared himself , very satisfied , with ms m ller s win , but also added that , like many , his personal favorite this year was the israeli author amos oz thomas steinfeld , on the web site of the leading german newspaper the s ddeutsche zeitung , may have put the sharpest point on what many were thinking readers and literature critics will have to , until further notice , separate themselves from a muchloved notion that the nobel prize for literature is a reward for the best writer and the best works , mr steinfeld said , before adding that ms m ller is not a bad author by no means but many who have read her seemed to genuinely appreciate her work a political voice , that also sings poetically , wrote ulrich baron , on spiegel online , the web site of the german magazine der spiegel writing on the web site of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper , tilman spreckelsen called it a great day for german literature  it is a very unique view of totalitarian states it is not only romania and ceausescu and securitate it is an extremely powerful and almost poetic description of suppression in police states , wherever you are , said michael naumann , who was the former chief executive of metropolitan books , one of ms m ller s us publishers the reaction of german book buyers was immediate , with her works quickly listed as out of stock on amazonde , the german version of the amazon web site as of thursday , the publisher had printed 40 , 000 copies of her latest novel and her publishers said they were trying to raise that to 100 , 000 or in practical terms as much paper as we can find , as wolfgang matz from carl hanser verlag put it mr matz was standing outside the headquarters of the german publishers booksellers association , watching reporters on their second stakeout of the day , waiting to film ms m ller arriving for the press conference there the small room at the association s offices , where the press conference took place , overlooked bertoltbrechtplatz , where a statue of the famous german playwright sits in front of the theater am schiffbauerdamm , home to brecht s berliner ensemble it was somewhat incongruous , given that mr brecht chose to live and work in communist east germany dressed in black pants and a black suit jacket , her hair in a black bob and wearing bright red lipstick , the tiny author , eyes darting nervously around the room , looked a bit like a goth kid who felt out of place on her first day of high school ms m ller had just won literature s biggest prize , but with a crush of cameramen and reporters many standing on chairs and all looming over her she appeared most to want somewhere to hide the first words out of her mouth were i can t even talk about it somehow it s too early i think i need time to put it all in order her serious attitude , discussing death and suppression for much of the halfhour press conference , must have infected the press corps none of the dozens of journalists gathered thought to ask her what she would do with the 14 million she won stefan pauly contributed reporting from berlin

chicago s bid to host the 2016 olympics received mostly praise , tempered by concerns over finances and transportation , in a report released wednesday by the on the plans of the four cities vying to host the games the among the finalists , underscoring the closeness of the race a month before ioc members are due to vote on the host city in copenhagen chicago is competing with tokyo , madrid and rio de janeiro usually they mention a bid that is not yet ready , and none of that was talked about , said robert livingstone , the producer of , an independent web site in canada that focuses on the olympic bid process this time there is no clear leader the report called chicago s 38 billion budget ambitious but achievable and said the bid had the support of national government officials as well as 67 percent of city residents , according to an ioc poll by comparison , 56 percent of toyko residents supported that city s bid in rio and madrid , 85 percent of residents supported the bids in each city the report noted , however , that the chicago bid organizers had not provided a full financial guarantee in the event of an economic shortfall , which is contrary to ioc requirements the city of chicago has promised up to 500 million to back the effort , and illinois has pledged an additional 250 million after ioc members toured chicago in april , mayor richard m daley pledged to sign the host city contract , which would place financial responsibility for the games in the hands of the city patrick g ryan , chicago s bid leader , said in a telephone interview wednesday that the city council was close to authorizing the mayor s pledge and that the organizers had arranged for up to 2 billion in private insurance the report also questioned whether chicago s metra rail system could handle the surge in olympic traffic , chicago organizers said that 12 billion had already been allotted to improve the city s infrastructure , regardless of whether the olympics are held there ryan said representatives of the chicago bid are spending the final month lobbying ioc members at sporting events worldwide and preparing for their presentation in copenhagen we 're not predicting victory , but we 've got a very competitive bid , we 've got a great city , and our team has done well , he said livingstone cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the report , noting that ioc members often vote for a range of reasons past winners , including beijing , have not come out ahead in the technical report the competition to host the 2016 games is considered particularly close is popular among many ioc members because the olympics have never been held in south america , but concerns about security have been raised the report took note of the city s safety challenges , but said organizers had shown that rio hosts two million people every year during carnival and celebrations although the report offered praise for the organizational efforts of each city , madrid and tokyo received relatively harsh criticism madrid , which is bidding for the second time after losing to london for the 2012 games , submitted a plan that lacked clarity and showed limited understanding of olympic requirements in budgeting of areas like transportation , the report said still , it found the city s 267 billion budget to be achievable and said its overall concept was well constructed tokyo s evaluation noted the low public support and found that some sites that the city had listed as existing would require extensive construction in a statement released wednesday , tokyo s organizers said domestic support for the games had been steadily increasing
bourne , mass wendie howland grows her own food and heats her water with rooftop solar panels she drives a prius with a bumper sticker that boasts one less suv but when mrs howland tried to take the next step in green living installing a 132foot windmill in her backyard that would generate enough electricity to power her home she hit a wall the planning board in this pastoral cape cod town twice rejected the project citing safety concerns and predicting an adverse effect on the character of the neighborhood mrs howland s defeat was sealed by a superior court ruling in july that backed the planning board s decision , underscoring the steep odds that residential windmill plans face nationwide after investing some 40 , 000 in a 10kilowatt turbine and legal fees , mrs howland and her husband , francis , are giving up their twoyear fight it s ludicrous , said mrs howland , 58 , a health care consultant we were trying to make our bills smaller as we got older , in a clean and responsible fashion , and it boggles my mind that ordinary people like us are n't allowed to do that the decision is likely to be scrutinized by towns across the region and even the nation as they grapple with how to regulate windmills on residential property in windrich regions , clashes like mrs howland s are increasingly common as conservationminded people seek to install small on their property battles over the height and noise level of residential windmills , and even over the shadows cast by their blades , are springing up from maine to california , even as the obama administration promotes renewable energy and the federal stimulus package provides 30 percent tax credits for homeowners who install wind turbines many towns still enforce old laws that prohibit anything taller than 30 feet or 40 feet on residential land a height too low for sufficient wind power generation , experts say wind turbines need to be at least 30 feet higher than anything within 500 feet , including trees , which often means a tower of 80 feet or more the howlands' windmill would have been more than three times the height of an average utility pole , to ensure that the surrounding white pines did not interfere everyone recoils at that , said jonathan d fitch , the howlands' lawyer it reminds me of the litigation involving cell towers in the beginning a lot of neighborhood hostility back then , but today you hardly notice them even before the howland case , cape cod was a battleground in the windmill debate a proposal to build the nation s first offshore wind farm has met with stiff opposition from those who say the project would spoil the natural beauty of nantucket sound while residential turbines remain a tiny fraction of the wind energy market , they are popping up often enough for many communities , especially in new england , the midwest and the west , to start regulating them nearly 2 , 700 wind units with capacities of 10 kilowatts or less , the size used for residences , were sold nationwide last year , up from 1 , 167 in 2007 , according to the , a trade group but challenges persist even in communities that have passed ordinances on windmills , like bourne , where residents overwhelmingly approved a bylaw regulating windmills at a town meeting in 2007 the wind energy association estimates that onethird of small wind projects are thwarted by vague or overly strict local laws , or by outdated zoning rules that preclude them it s mostly that they will make the rules so prohibitive that they essentially ban installations , said ron stimmel , the association s small wind advocate there are humongous hurdles that no other type of installation has been faced with in waukee , iowa , the city council is considering a law that would allow and encourage the use of small windenergy systems but would ban them on singlefamily homes in islip , ny , a new provision allows residents to install windmills up to 45 feet tall probably not high enough to make the investment worthwhile , mr stimmel said and in bourne , a town of about 19 , 000 , the 2007 bylaw limits residential windmills to 75 feet high unless the homeowner can prove that a taller windmill is needed and would not increase any adverse impacts in july , during the howlands' trial , brian wall , a lawyer for bourne , told judge christopher muse of barnstable county superior court that the howlands had not provided enough evidence that their windmill would be quiet and safe if this 1 , 600pound thing falls or something falls off it in the area around it , he said , citing the possibility of ice flying off the blades in winter , it needs to be safe mr wall said the town needed an engineer s guarantee that in heavy winds the windmill would not crash onto neighboring homes the closest is 105 feet from its proposed base even though its pole is designed to fold in such weather , not break apart he added that no qualified engineer had certified that the windmill would be quiet or that its shadow flicker the strobe of sunlight passing through rotating blades would not bother the howlands' neighbors in his ruling , judge muse wrote that while he did not believe the windmill would pose a safety threat , the planning board s decision fell within its discretion and was not unreasonable , whimsical , capricious or arbitrary megan amsel of the , a nonprofit group that promotes alternative energy in cape cod and southeastern massachusetts , said she had seen some disastrous wind projects not because they proved unsafe , but because they did not generate enough power it s really hard to find a good installer , she said , adding that there are no certification requirements i 've seen some real disasters , and it can give this emerging industry a black eye the wind needs to blow at least 12 miles an hour for a turbine to generate electricity a requirement that rules out many sites and the initial cost is steep mr stimmel said that the average cost of buying and installing a residential turbine was 30 , 000 , and that it took 6 years to 30 years to recover that cost through energy savings the total cost for the howlands' turbine , including installation , would be 72 , 000 , they said to mrs howland , the town s claim that a windmill would hurt the character of her neighborhood was especially galling none of her closest neighbors objected , she said there is no aesthetic clause in the bylaw because aesthetics are subjective , she said for every person i know who says , i do n't like it , ' i hear another say , i think they 're beautiful'
the looked across the field friday night and saw similarities with the first , the mets were wearing throwback uniforms inspired by ones worn by the new york giants in the early 20th century and like the mets , the giants have tended to struggle offensively and were prone to nights like friday the mets won the game , 30 , thanks to bobby parnell , who threw six strong innings in his second major league start but the giants and mets are different in one important aspect the giants have a realistic chance to make the playoffs before the season started , the giants were one of the last teams figured to be in playoff contention , while the mets were thought to be world series contenders but the giants entered the fourgame series with the mets in second place in the national league wildcard standings , thanks to a strong pitching staff that leads the majors in earned run average that staff has helped compensate for the giants' offensive deficiencies they are 29th in the majors in home runs the only team worse is the mets so , naturally , a home run was hit in the first inning this one came from angel pagan , who led off the first inning for the mets with his of the season it was all the cushion parnell \( 34 \) needed parnell made just the second start of his career since moving from the bullpen after a seasonending hamstring injury to jon niese with the mets' playoff hopes all but gone , parnell will most likely get an extended audition as a starter for the rest of the season we did n't know whether or not he could fill that particular role , manager said there was always some question about whether or not his secondary pitches could be effective , whether he had enough command to go through the lineup a couple of times his first start , against san diego last saturday , did not go so well the mets restricted his pitch count , but parnell used up all those pitches , 68 of them , after just two and a third innings i think you almost have to take the first start because of all the anxiety involved in that and throw it out , manuel said he threw a lot of pitches early in that game , and tonight it appeared as though he had control of that anxiety and performed extremely well parnell had a pitch count of 8085 friday and manuel jokingly said before the game that he hoped parnell would last longer than two innings he did parnell came out after six innings and 86 pitches he allowed only three hits , striking out seven and walking none san diego was kind of a learning experience for me , and that s the way i took it , parnell said parnell used a heavy dose of his twoseam and fourseam fastballs , which were consistently in the low to middle 90s , to keep the giants at arms length during parnell s six innings , the giants never had a runner reach second base his lone moment of concern came in the sixth , when , with two outs , freddy sanchez singled and parnell then went 30 on pablo sandoval pitching coach dan warthen went out to tell him that sandoval would be his last hitter , regardless of the result it was n't a stressful 85 pitches , manuel said he seemed to be very much in control , and i thought with that being the case , we 'd give him the opportunity to get that last out parnell battled back , and sandoval flied out to gary sheffield in left the bullpen held on from there , who has struggled recently , came on for a scoreless , sweatless ninth inning to get his 26th save over all , it was an efficient night for the mets during a season that has hardly been worth remembering inside pitch carlos beltran took fly balls in the outfield before friday s game and will work out again before saturday s game jerry manuel said he was very optimistic that beltran could rejoin the team soon but added that there was no timetable for his return i saw probably the tail end of it , manuel said of the workout the early part of it was from what i understand very , very good kind of the way he explained to me was that maybe there was some fatigue that kind of set in after the number of reps that he did n't feel as good as he did when he started from what i understand , he 'll do the same thing tomorrow and see how he responds beltran said through the team spokesman jay horwitz that he was satisfied with friday s workout , but would hold off on commenting about his health until he completed his workout saturday manuel did not remove from the rotation and said hernandez , 34 , would start monday against the giants hernandez is 77 with a 528 earned run average , but his last two starts were disastrous he lost both games , working just nine combined innings while allowing 12 runs s sixthinning double tied him for second place on the mets' career list with the hitting coach howard johnson billy wagner pitched for class a port st lucie and retired all three batters he faced while throwing 12 pitches
by the end of scott boras s afternoon at citi field , which included lunch , a tour and a healthy chat about his clients , the mets were not making plans to add derek lowe s nameplate above a locker in their swank new clubhouse nor were they about to dust off the \( oliver \) perez 46 edition from shea stadium but the mets doubtless have a better idea what it will take to secure lowe s services for the next three seasons or , should those plans disintegrate , whether they will be able to resign perez at a lower price the mets remain confident that they will eventually sign one of them preferably lowe , whose durability and consistency they value they are reluctant , though , to sweeten the threeyear , 36 million proposal offered to lowe last week that bid was rejected , and boras apparently believes that lowe can command a more lucrative contract elsewhere teams that have been linked to lowe include the red sox , brewers and braves , though none of them seem interested in matching let alone exceeding the mets current offer as is his custom , boras is waiting to see if a fuller market develops , making it unlikely that a decision is imminent groundball pitchers like lowe are always attractive , but particularly so for the mets because of two factors both relate to stadiums the first is citi field , whose dimensions look to be more spacious than that of its predecessor , shea , which was widely viewed as a pitcher s haven , but could benefit hitters depending on the wind currents the second is cozy citizens bank park in philadelphia can t hit a ball over the fence if it doesn t leave the ground , right \? lowe is 21 with a 249 era in four career starts there , including a loss in game 1 of the nlcs over his career he has done a good job of neutralizing ryan howard \( 2 for 21 \) , shane victorino \( 1 for 10 \) and raul ibanez \( 2 for 19 , 2 hr \) , if not chase utley \( 9 for 20 \) as my colleague jack curry wrote last week , the mets may still end up offering another 1 million annually and or a relatively easily fourthyear vesting option , which i d think would be enough but if not , the mets will move on to plan b perez while also monitoring tim redding and randy wolf , hoping to add another veteran to compete with the lefthander jon niese so , with nearly five weeks before pitchers and catchers report \( feb 13 \) , the mets rotation has three sure things in johan santana , mike pelfrey and john maine if the season were to begin today \( and i think you re all thankful it doesn t \) , niese and bobby parnell would occupy the last two slots if you were omar minaya , how would you fill out the mets rotation \?
philadelphia the pedro martinez era began on a lessthancertain note wednesday , as the signed him and , before the ink was dry , placed him on the 15day disabled list with a strained right shoulder this was nothing but a procedural maneuver , the phillies assured this way , martinez gets his demand for a major league contract and a chance to restore his throwing arm in minor league starts without counting against the 25man active roster still , the team spoke of as if it had to be seasoned and cured like a ham before he could join the rotation in perhaps two to three weeks it remains to be seen whether philadelphia has spent a reported 1 million to sign a helpful fifth starter or merely a faded reputation in his final two years with the mets , martinez was plagued by injuries and started only 25 games , going 87 with a 499 earned run average dressed in a dark suit , skyblue shirt and paisley tie at a news conference , martinez appeared less paunchy than he had in recent newspaper photos he was by turns funny , selfdeprecating , poignant and defiant given several chances to verbally throw high and inside at the mets , the team he played for for the last four seasons , he instead tossed gracious bon mots he mentioned love so many times , it could have been the summer of 1969 instead of 2009 i totally understand the business side of baseball , said martinez , who can earn an additional 15 million in incentives as dirty as it is , i respect it i 've got nothing to say but god bless them , ' martinez said of the mets as he went on and on about them i wish them well i hope that they all get healthy and come back to compete this raised the suspicion of one reporter who wondered whether martinez could truly be a phillie if he did not hate the mets , or at least the mets' fans the reporter did everything but demand a loyalty test , telling martinez that she wanted to be sure he would be wearing the right hat when he pitched against the mets do n't confuse that now , martinez gently scolded with humor it could be my mom standing up there with the bat if i have to back her up he said he looked forward to embracing phillies fans they seem to be really wild , and i'm a little bit out there , too but added i ca n't do anything with the hate you feel for the mets' fans that s between you guys during his years with the mets , hamstrung by injury and disappointment \( and a 561 era last season \) , martinez said i think i was too brave sometimes i was stupid sometimes for pitching sometimes your desire , and the way you feel about competing , drive you to do things you should n't do the last few years have been horrible i'm not saying horrible because of the results , but because i have n't felt the way i wanted to feel martinez acknowledged that he would never again be the pitcher he was at 26 and even with all his charm and charisma and three cy young awards , not even he can assure that he will be of any assistance as the phillies seek to win a second consecutive world series i'm not going to say anything i'm just here to prove it , martinez said talking , you do n't win games i want to get to the white lines and see what i can do i might surprise you i might not , but it s going to be something really fun to find out exiting the allstar break , the but the phillies lost brett myers in june with a hip injury , and the rookie antonio bastardo , who replaced myers , was placed on the disabled list with a strained left shoulder after making five starts martinez is seen as a lowrisk investment by the club , although skepticism remains in a city that always believes success is merely a sign that disaster lurks around the corner will martinez s entourage bring disorder to the clubhouse \? will he strain the phillies' bullpen if he cannot pitch beyond the fifth inning \? is he merely a patch on a tire that is vulnerable to a major blowout without additional retreading of the rotation \? if this is it , if there is no trade to acquire or another topoftheline pitcher , then we are watching wishful thinking in action ,  still , philadelphia is proceeding on the faith that martinez will summon some semblance of his past self often enough over the final months of the season to keep hope alive for another run at a championship of course , there s some risk here , but i think we 'd rather risk it on someone of his caliber , said ruben amaro jr , the phillies' general manager at the moment , martinez s right shoulder is sore from having dye injected during a physical examination his workouts have amounted to little more than throwing long toss since he he faced live batters for only two 60pitch workouts for the phillies this month martinez said that he would be the first to know if he could still pitch in the majors if my health fails , i 'll go , he said but , facing a roomful of reporters , he added , none of you is going to drag me out , not one comment , not anybody out there
when he finally came to rest , james harrison sure needed to harrison , the ' allpro linebacker , had just intercepted a kurt warner pass and rumbled 100 yards for a touchdown that was heartstopping not just for a worldwide audience , but , it appeared for a few minutes , perhaps harrison himself exhausted from the longest play in history , harrison lay supine on the side of the end zone all but motionless , trying to catch his breath harrison s feat came as the first half expired by the end of halftime , fans using cellphones in front of their televisions had littered youtube with more than a dozen shaky clips of harrison s play , an instant classic to be honest , i really did n't think i 'd make it all the way back , harrison said my teammates threw some vicious blocks warner s errant pass came as his arizona cardinals , trailing 107 with 18 seconds remaining in the half but on the steelers' 1 , appeared poised to tie the score or take the lead warner zipped a quick pass to receiver anquan boldin just inside the goal line , but harrison jumped in front of boldin and caught it instead i was n't able to see him around my linemen , warner said he made a great play , not just the interception but to get it in for the touchdown clearly , arizona was not going to score but harrison was instantly intent on doing so himself he broke toward the right sideline and ran up it at full speed as he cut left at the steelers' 30 , warner tried to tackle him before being blocked by cornerback deshea townsend , and the play developed further steelers defenders turned into blockers while arizona s offensive players desperately ran after harrison this season s associated press defensive player of the year after making 16 sacks and forcing seven fumbles , the 242pound harrison began looking less like a linebacker and more like earl campbell harrison cut back toward the sideline and crossed the 50 without slowing down his fellow linebacker patrick bailey blocked running back tim hightower out of the play as harrison crossed the arizona 30 i was seeing jerseys that were friendly and jerseys that were n't , harrison said running the length of the field at full speed himself , the 316pound cardinals tackle mike gandy tried to shoestringtackle harrison at the 10 but missed just before the goal line , arizona s steve breaston smacked into harrison from behind while larry fitzgerald tried to wrestle him down , but harrison s momentum was too great he slumped to the ground helmetfirst just beyond the goal line harrison rolled over and lay face up , his arms and legs extended , as if making a motionless snow angel he did not get up for a full two minutes while being visited by the steelers' medical staff during that time , not only was a penalty flag 100 yards away ruled an arizona infraction , but the video referee also looked into whether the ball had crossed the goal line before the tackle it was a crucial call harrison had taken all 18 seconds left on the clock to run the length of the field , so if he was ruled short of the goal line , pittsburgh would have to choose between going for a field goal or a touchdown on its last play with no time remaining i 've never been more emotionally drained in my life , he said just as harrison began to inhale oxygen through a mask , the referee terry mcaulay announced that the play would stand the momentum swing was even bigger than harrison had boldin caught the ball in the end zone , the cardinals would have taken a 3 or 4point lead instead , the steelers went into halftime ahead by 10 that was the difference in the game , steelers safety troy polamalu said we had a defensive touchdown , and they did n't the longest play in super bowl history had been a 99yard kickoff return by the green bay packers' desmond howard in super bowl xxxi the longest interception return was 76 yards by the seattle seahawks' kelly herndon against the steelers three years ago harrison did not run quite fast enough every time he needed to , though he was one of the final three steelers trying to catch none other than fitzgerald , the man who could not tackle him in time two hours before , during fitzgerald s 64yard touchdown reception with 2 minutes 37 seconds remaining
people who were pushing for dark knight were left scanning the skies , looking for a spotlighted image of the caped one , or at least some meaning in the snubbing why did dark knight get stiffed \? was it the comic book factor \? an aversion to big studios at a time when people are up to here with them \? or maybe , just maybe , it was the fact that the third act was a confusing montage , a multicomponent kit that required assembly and a second or third viewing to unpack movies are lucky to get a single viewing from many impatient academy voters , so quite a few probably just gave up on it the bagger picked the dark knight to make it , said watch out for gran torino and to prepare for a defiance surprise um , none of that happened

much of the conversation between tennis fans on thursday was centered on how quickly the match between roger federer and robin soderling changed on wednesday what looked like a straightsets clinic of brilliant play by federer turned into a tense battle that the top seed was fortunate to escape up , two sets to none , and cruising in the thirdset tiebreaker , federer momentarily took his foot off the gas and soderling won the third set and nearly won the fourth the match is a good example of the importance of momentum in a tennis match in chuck kriese s coaching bible total tennis training , he describes why this invisible force is so important for a player to understand tennis more than any other sport , is a game of momentum the absence of a clock to do the dirty work of finishing off an opponent , and a scoring system based on units used makes the flow of the match much more important than any lead that has been established melanie oudin s precocious understanding of both momentum and match dynamics helped her come back against three veteran players , all of whom looked rudderless when they found themselves in a fight they never saw coming what can a player do when momentum shifts \? alistair higham , a british tennis coach , has written a fascinating book on the subject momentum , the hidden force in tennis he believes that there are five distinct phases of momentum and that players can learn to recognize what stage they are in at one end of the spectrum , momentum is totally against you , and higham suggests slowing things down , being deliberate and following rituals in baseball , when a pitcher is getting knocked around , the pitching coach strolls to the mound hoping to stall the rally timeouts in basketball are used for this reason as well when momentum is turning against you , higham suggests increasing energy and playing more aggressively when momentum is neutral , each player is vying to not only win points , but also to begin to control the momentum to accomplish this , higham says that tennis players need to develop a kind of radar for spotting momentum changes kriese taught his clemson teams to manage momentum these unplanned events can change momentum quickly and cannot often be controlled but the athlete should understand that they do occur , and he should be ready to deal with the situation at hand in the best way he can some aspects of momentum can be controlled , however these are based on two variables in the match 1 \) the score , and 2 \) the events leading up to the score in a tight match , pressure swings back and forth from player to player based on these two variables he will have a definite advantage if he knows exactly how to manage momentum of the top players in the game rafael nadal understands momentum the best he is most adept at gaining a slight edge in a match and then relentlessly widening it in higham s phases of momentum , rafa excels at gaining some slight momentum , then picking up his energy even higher until he has momentum totally with him , the last phase , according to higham against monfils on tuesday night , nadal trailed , 67 and 22 in the second , but upped his positive intensity and left monfils wondering how his hardearned lead could evaporate so quickly
ryan avent has some fairly harsh words for arnold kling s recalculation theory of business cycles tyler cowen , predictably , thinks ryan is too snide  but what none of the participants in the debate seem to realize is that arnold is basically reinventing 1934 macroeconomics here s two bits from schumpeter  it s all there mass unemployment is necessary , because you have to shift resources away from sectors that got too big , stimulus is a bad thing because it slows the necessary adjustment and now as then , the whole notion falls apart when you ask why , say , a housing boom which requires shifting resources into housing doesn t produce the same kind of unemployment as a housing bust that shifts resources out of housing
with the tributes and diatribes following the death of the neoconservative godfather irving kristol slowing to a trickle , it feels like it might be time to pack up the old copies of the public interest and tamp down the weekendlong nostalgia for young trotskyites with brownbag lunches , contrarian social scientists and the days when the words public and intellectual could be used in a single phrase without irony war and politics beckon , courtesy of none other than the washington post s bob woodward the top us and nato commander in afghanistan warns in an urgent , confidential assessment of the war that he needs more forces within the next year and bluntly states that without them , the eightyear conflict will likely result in failure , according to a copy of the 66page document obtained by the washington post gen stanley a mcchrystal says emphatically failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the nearterm \( next 12 months \) while afghan security capacity matures risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible his assessment was sent to defense secretary robert m gates on aug 30 and is now being reviewed by president obama and his national security team while much of the debate following woodward s story focuses on the actual us military strategy in afghanistan should we surge or should we go \? some noted the political frustration that the leaking of the document has surely presented to the obama administration there was no revelation about the source or intent of the leak , but an accompanying analysis in the post quoted an unnamed pentagon official who admitted a serious frustration with the pace at which the obama administration is addressing the situation in afghanistan peter feaver at foreign policy s shadow government writes that the obama administration has been woodwarded again , this time with a major scoop in the first two points of a sevenpoint analysis , feaver writes  1 it is not good to have a document like this leaked into the public debate before the president has made his decision whether you favor ramping up or ramping down or ramping laterally , as a process matter , the commanderinchief ought to be able to conduct internal deliberations on sensitive matters without it appearing concurrently on the front pages of the post i assume the obama team is very angry about this , and i think they have every right to be 2 a case could be made that the obama team tempted fate by authorizing bob woodward to travel with general jones \( cf whisky , tango , foxtrot \) in the first place and then sitting on this report for nearly a month without a white house response you cannot swing a dead cat in washington without meeting someone who was briefed on at least part of the mcchrystal assessment , and virtually every one of those folks is mystified as to why the white house has not responded as of yet the white house will have to respond now , but i stand by my first point leaks like this make it harder to for the commanderinchief to do deliberate national security planning at the plank , michael crowley question s whether the alleged pressure tactics are fair play in the wake of the tainted afghan elections , barack obama sounds increasingly wary about a major escalation in america s support for a government widely seen as illegitimate \( not to mention corrupt \) important people in the white house , including joe biden , understand that you can t wage a winning counterinsurgency on behalf of a broadly distrusted government but the military establishment obviously wants to proceed , and is increasingly relying on press leaks to pressure the obama team to deliver the boots crowley says that this is an awfully uncomfortable spot for obama to be in , but that what the generals want is not the only consideration here their job is to tell obama how the war can be won obama s job is to decide whether , in the context of america s myriad priorities at home and abroad , it s worth the projected cost at swampland , joe klein notes that the uncertainty of the situation in afghanistan makes this a bad time for the president to be put under pressure to make a decision what s provocative about the report is that it was leaked to woodward a serious breach of conduct by someone , possibly in the military \( or a supporter the military s position \) this was an effort to lobby a quick decision on troop strength which the military wants , so that it can begin planning the 2010 fighting season in afghanistan but a quick decision is not a good idea right now the president needs to know what the next afghan government is going to look like will there be a runoff between hamid karzai and abdullah abdullah \? if karzai still manages to score more than 50 percent after the phony ballots are tossed , will abdullah and other karzai opponents endorse the karzai government \? what sort of moves will karzai make to restore some confidence in his government \? are the canadians going to stay in kandarhar province , are the british going to stay in helmand \? are the dutch and australians going to stay in uruzgan \? obama was absolutely right on the sunday talk shows troop levels aren t nearly as important as strategy he has , at most , one more shot at getting this right the military piece is only one part of the picture but for many conservatives , like john mccain , it is the only piece that matters that is a disastrously myopic way to look at an exceedingly complicated problem any attempts by the military , or their allies , to pressure a troop increase now are premature and misguided michael goldfarb at the weekly standard blog seems to have no such compunctions about forcing the hand of the commanderinchief , and that it is in fact in obama s best interest to put aside his health care push and respond quickly obama s handpicked commander has laid out a strategy for defeating al qaeda and the taliban during the campaign obama had promised to give the war in afghanistan the attention and resources necessary to do just that in explicit contrast to the bush administration whom he alleged had diverted the resources and attention of the military from the real threat of al qaeda and their taliban allies in afghanistan mcchrystal leaves no doubt about what must be done if obama is to keep his word more troops and very soon the president cannot delay that decision any more not for the sake of his health care initiative or anything else and in any case , as a matter of politics the best thing for obama and the democrats is to win the war yesterday obama immodestly compared himself to some of the great presidents of american history maybe you hear what people had to say about abraham lincoln , or what they had to say about fdr , or what they had to say about ronald reagan when he first came in and was trying to change our approach to government that answer came in response to a question from george stephanopoulos about the health care town halls during the august recess but it wasn t legislative accomplishments that made those men great presidents it was their decision to commit fully to the major conflicts of the day and to win decisively health care reform won t make or break obama s presidency the way he conducts the war in afghanistan will dave schuler at outside the beltway actually does look outside the beltway to observe that real costs of an iraqtype surge in afghanistan will not be just political having appointed gen mcchrystal to his post , with the full knowledge the gen mcchrystal would advocate a counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan , and given conventional counterinsurgency doctrine , i think it will be difficult for president obama to deny him more troops but he s damned if he does and damned if he doesn t the more american troops in an active role defending the afghans , the more american casualties , and the more political pressure to withdraw from afghanistan peter catapano is a staff editor in opinion eric etheridge will return next monday
peshawar , maj gen tariq khan , commander of pakistan s frontier corps paramilitary force , got some bad news the other day the pakistani army needed its two helicopters back for a more urgent mission trouble was , they were the only two helicopters general khan had that day or any other day to combat and the in the country s lawless tribal areas if the army needs their assets , we do n't get priority , general khan said of the transport and attack aircraft that the army lends him because his forces have none of their own so it goes for the frontier corps , a stepchild of the army that has to borrow most of its heavy weaponry , even as it increasingly finds itself on the front lines fighting qaeda and taliban operations that threaten american troops in afghanistan and are increasingly destabilizing pakistan still , with the 500 , 000member pakistani army focused on its archenemy , india , and reluctant to embrace serious counterinsurgency training , the frontier corps , long maligned as poorly trained , ill equipped and at times in league with the insurgents , may yet be the country s best immediate hope for countering a fastspreading militancy unlike the punjabidominated army , the 60 , 000 troops in the frontier corps are largely drawn from pashtun tribesmen who know the language and culture of the tribal areas , making it the most suitable force to combat an insurgency there , pakistani and american military officials say enter general khan , a portly , 52yearold tank commander who made his name last year battling the pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud in south waziristan he took command of the corps seven months ago and has sought to drag it from its 19thcentury borderpatrol past into the 21stcentury world of counterinsurgency the general , who once was pakistan s military representative at the united states central command headquarters in tampa , fla , has already improved morale by raising salaries and expanding medical care to dependents he has drafted a detailed plan to overhaul the corps , aiming to transform it into a more agile lightly armed force while also swelling its ranks by more than 10 , 000 to allow home leaves he is an unusually progressive officer , a trait that has ruffled some feathers among his army brethren in this conservative society , general khan plans to offer women jobs as medics in reararea field hospitals , freeing up male orderlies to fight pakistani and american officials say the frontier corps is already more effective now the corps s forces , fighting alongside regular army soldiers , have largely wrapped up operations against the taliban in the bajaur , mohmand and khyber areas of the tribal belt , the general said a new commando unit within the frontier corps has used information from the central intelligence agency and other sources to kill or capture as many as 60 militants in the past seven months , a senior pakistani military official said the results speak for themselves , owais ahmed ghani , the governor of the northwest frontier province , which includes the tribal areas , said in an interview general khan has strong support from the army chief of staff , gen ashfaq parvez kayani but many military analysts question whether general khan will get the resources and backing to continue carrying out his changes moreover , some critics say , the recent frontier corps operations have not eliminated the taliban threat , but just shunted it to neighboring areas the frontier corps has shown improvement , but there s still a long way to go , said hasan askari rizvi , a military analyst in lahore the taliban are entrenched and move quickly from one area to another the united states has thrown its support behind the corps the pentagon has spent more than 40 million to equip it with new body armor , vehicles , radios and surveillance equipment , with more in the pipeline over all , american officials have said that the united states could spend more than 400 million in the next several years to enhance the corps , including building a training base near peshawar a united states army special forces officer is assigned to the corps s headquarters here to help share intelligence and coordinate operations with american forces across the border in afghanistan last fall , about 30 american and british military instructors spent three months training some 120 senior enlisted corps troops in new weapons , combat tactics , communications and other technical skills those pakistani troops will in turn train additional corps forces but a review of policy on afghanistan and pakistan by the national security council this year , under former president george w bush , concluded that the trainthetrainer approach was so indirect that it would take about 12 years to field an effective counterinsurgency force they 've got a long way to go before you can rely on them , representative john f tierney , a massachusetts democrat , said of the corps mr tierney s oversight subcommittee has conducted several hearings on pakistan in an interview here at his headquarters , a massive 19thcentury brick fortress built by the british , general khan said that a relatively modest investment say , 300 million in sensors , nightfighting equipment , sniper rifles and helicopters would enable the corps to respond to specific threats within 90 minutes and to go independently anywhere it wanted to go it would change the dimension of the combat capacity of the frontier corps , he said in the long run , it would reduce expenditures because you would n't need so many troops in the end , general khan said the only longterm solution was to rebuild the tribal leadership structure that has been decimated by taliban attacks , and then provide

with his wrinkled hand , buddy ryan began to sketch on a notepad the defense he made famous he scribbled four defensive linemen , added two linebackers near the line of scrimmage , marked two safeties close behind he pointed at one safety , no 46 that s blondie , ryan said recently goldilocks , i called him blondie is doug plank , plank played for the chicago bears when ryan served as defensive coordinator ryan built a defense in chicago that changed football that defense led buddy s son rex into coaching and he carried the tenets of it with him to the jets , where he hired plank as an assistant coach along the way , coaches asked him the same questions how did the defense become known as the 46 \? were there four down linemen and six linebackers \? that was n't it at all , said it was named after doug plank plank wore long , curly blond hair , loaded up on aspirin before games and tucked smelling salts in his pants sometimes , when collisions left him really dizzy , plank found the huddle by comparing the colors of the jerseys he hit hard , he hit often and he led with his helmet before doing so was outlawed in the rose bowl while playing for ohio state , plank sought the biggest , meanest blocker he could find on the opening kickoff , then delivered a blow that cracked his own helmet open like an oversize peanut shell that guy would light you up , rex ryan said he was a mean , tough hombre he really tried to knock people out buddy ryan arrived in chicago in 1978 , and he inherited a defense that could not rush the passer , or stop the run an embarrassment , he called it but he also had a penchant for invention , a way of moving players around to create confusion , emphasizing strengths and camouflaging weaknesses he named blitzes after players , or their numbers , or random things like cheeseburgers in one meeting , ryan drew a formation on the board he grouped four defensive linemen with two linebackers , eliminating the bubbles between offensive linemen that running backs sprinted through he moved the safeties close behind the sixman front he scribbled 46 blitz on the board , and no one thought that was anything unusual just buddy being buddy , plank said the bears had assigned plank no 25 in 1975 but on the first day of training camp , a receiver named ron shanklin instructed him to hand the jersey over , and as a 12thround selection , plank eagerly complied how about 46 \? he recalled the equipment manager asking the plan worked immediately , buddy ryan said part of the concept predated his arrival in chicago , to the days of george allen , the hall of fame coach jack pardee worked with allen , and pardee said allen often used an occasional safety blitz , a wrinkle that pardee said ryan developed into a mainstay , a full scheme ryan first installed the 46 as a nickel pressure package , and it became the bears' base defense in 1981 he kept tweaking his new toy , and in 1985 he produced a defense unlike any the nfl had seen some say the 46 is just an eightman front , he said that s like saying marilyn monroe is just a girl the genius of the 46 was how ryan created and disguised pressure he selected mismatches , overloaded zones , stuffed gaps or dropped players clustered near the line into coverage the 46 forced offensive linemen to adjust their blocking with guesswork and pressed quarterbacks to make instant decisions it required cornerbacks who excelled in mantoman coverage , athletic defensive linemen and a safety who roamed behind it was all timing , said jeff fisher , another bears safety and the tennessee titans' coach the read progression for the quarterback was , i'm throwing this ball as fast as i can ryan also bolstered accountability among his players , drawing from his stint as a master sergeant in the korean war plank feared only monday mornings , when his mistakes were reviewed by ryan in front of his defensive teammates when plank s nfl career ended in 1982 , ryan told him the 46 defense would make him famous , that he would always remain the answer to one important football trivia question they shared a chuckle and went on their way plank was out of football by 1985 , he estimated that half of the quarterbacks who started games against them failed to finish them that season it reminded plank of the offensive anarchy he once heard from linemen confused by the 46 formation not only did the bears win at that time , but they did it in a fashion , a manner , that i do n't think has been duplicated , plank said plank s playing style had resulted in more concussions than he could recall , and after football , he endured five knee operations , a shoulder replacement and a partially numb left leg he lost almost two inches from his nearly 6foot frame burned out on the game , plank went into the fastfood business he owned 22 burger king franchises in three states he said he worked seven days a week , 20 hours a day , burying those moments when he felt sorry for himself in burgers buddy ryan turned 46 into the family number his exwife , doris , wrote her dissertation on his defense rex published a coaching manual inspired by the 46 initially , ryan had steered his twin boys , rex and rob , from football but when it became clear they would follow him into the family business , he sat them inside a motel room in weatherford , okla , and drew for hours on an easel , passing along the family secrets , formations instead of recipes it was like watching picasso paint , and one framed sketch hangs on the wall at the motel buddy ryan was named the head coach of the arizona cardinals in 1994 plank heard of the hire on the radio while driving to one of his restaurants he made a detour to congratulate his former coach , which led to his working as a cardinals radio analyst , which led to his return to coaching plank never lost track of ryan s sons , and he recognized their father s influence in baltimore , rex ryan attacked quarterbacks from different angles , feigned pressure when none was coming , moved players all over the field , left cornerbacks on islands sure , rex ryan ran a 34 base defense , but that was all part of the evolution football evolved , too along came bill walsh with his west coast offense , a shortpassing game built on timing and spacing again , buddy ryan had influenced changes to pro football , only this change helped phase out his famous defense plank still sees the 46 in the nfl coaches produced by those bears defenses , in fisher and mike singletary , the 49ers' head coach , along with leslie frazier , the vikings' defensive coordinator rex ryan sees it at his father s horse farm in kentucky , where thoroughbreds receive names like 46 blitz and blitz to win buddy ryan sees it in the defenses run by his sons everything begins as an idea , plank said the 46 was an idea , and with that little notion , buddy changed football there s no doubt he changed the way the game was played even now , plank receives autograph requests in the mail , and sometimes when he signs a piece of memorabilia , the person mails it back to him inevitably , the seeker wants plank to add something to his signature they want him to add his number no 46
as coaches are employed , bred and required by circumstance to do , norm roberts played down the notion that there was any special significance to st john s game sunday at no 1 pittsburgh and if there was a time that playing the nation s highestranked team could be just another game , it is this season in the big east , which is home to 9 of the current top 25 teams just four days after playing the panthers , st john s \( 104 , 11 \) will run into another highly ranked conference opponent , no 5 connecticut so roberts said what he was supposed to say that every conference game is important but it just so happens that pittsburgh is the no 1 team in america , and that there s nothing special about what we 're doing this week to prepare his young players have seen enough of sportscenter to know the routine , and they tried to follow the thisisnodifferentfromeveryothergame drill but something is different and the reason is not so much the game st john s is about to play , but rather the game before something sank in with the red storm a week ago when it beat , at no 7 the highestranked team st john s has defeated during roberts s fiveyear tenure the red storm underwent a bit of an attitude adjustment after a 21point loss to providence in its big east opener on dec 31 the players said a heightened dedication in practices and the subsequent , and , admittedly , uncharacteristic effort against notre dame proved rewarding there was the euphoria they felt from winning , and the swarm of congratulations they received from family , friends , classmates and even strangers they enjoyed the fruits of their labors , so they continued working for another taste we learned a lot about playing 40 minutes , the sophomore forward sean evans said we have to bring this mindset to every game evans spoke about how much more focused he and his teammates were in practice the sophomore forward justin burrell said that the team was working harder in practice than he could remember , and that there was none of the bickering or distracting side conversations that had been too prevalent in the past and the sophomore swingman d j kennedy confirmed that that had been the way the team had operated since the providence loss even roberts was willing to acknowledge a rise in intensity , though he attributed it to preparing for a hardnosed team like pittsburgh \( 140 , 20 \) we 've emphasized being much more physical in practice , roberts said he showed his team on film things it did against notre dame that it needed to continue doing those things have roots in effort and determination like rebounding with both hands and playing tough onball defense the red storm held notre dame to four 3pointers compared with its average of 93 a game it also includes executing the offense with patience to get the ball inside and attacking the basket in transition rather than settling for jump shots for kennedy , the pittsburgh game is a trip home he grew up in the city s hill district as a panthers fan and was a teammate of the current pittsburgh sophomore dejuan blair at schenley high school he and evans said the red storm was going to pittsburgh to win , regardless of rankings it 'd be big for our program , big for the school , big for the city , evans said but what may be a more realistic expectation is for st john s to prove it can be consistently competitive in the big east , in which it has not been among the top 10 teams since 2003 or finished at 500 since 2002 a close loss at pittsburgh could be a victory in the reputation column people will see that we 're headed in the right direction coming off this big win against notre dame , kennedy said if we play pitt close , people will say that st john s is really able to play with the top teams in the big east as well as no 1 that perception has gained some traction , and pittsburgh coach jamie dixon said his team was well aware of st john s capabilities and while st john s is looking for its first win against a no 1ranked team since 1985 , pittsburgh is experiencing life as the nation s topranked team for the first time in the history of its program we 've talked about it , our ranking being two things , dixon said it can be either a distraction or serve as motivation and we 've really vowed to limit our distractions this year and find ways to use anything that comes upon us as motivation
washington six chinese muslims were flown from the united states military detention center at , cuba , to palau , the island nation in the pacific ocean , as part of the obama administration s effort to close the prison , an administration official said saturday the transfer leaves seven of the chinese detainees , known as the , still confined at the naval base , along with 208 other men the uighurs have been at the heart of a longrunning legal , political and ethical debate about the detention center since their incarceration there more than seven years ago the prison has become an international symbol of american excesses in the war against terrorism , and an increasingly frustrating problem for the white house the release of the men had been announced by the justice department , but the timing was kept a secret for security reasons until the detainees were safely in palau , where they are expected to remain while seeking a permanent home elsewhere wells dixon , a lawyer at the center for constitutional rights who represents three of the men , said , palau is courageous to offer our uighur clients a temporary home we are hopeful that other countries like australia and germany will resettle them permanently in a late saturday , the justice department identified the men as ahmad tourson , abdul ghappar abdul rahman , edham mamet , anwar hassan , dawut abdurehim and adel noori as we near the completion of our review of detainees at guant namo bay , we will continue to work closely with the department of state to implement transfer decisions , matthew olsen , executive director of the guant namo review task force , said in the release the uighurs , from western china , were taken into custody in 2001 in afghanistan and pakistan they have long been determined by american authorities to pose no security threat , but they are regarded as terrorists by the chinese government and have said that they fear persecution if they are returned there last month , a case involving 13 of the men reached the united states supreme court , have the power to release into the united states detainees who are determined by authorities to pose no security threat in october 2008 , a federal judge in the district of columbia ordered the uighurs released into the custody of their supporters in the united states , mainly in the washington area but an appeals court overturned that ruling in february , saying judges have no authority to override laws to force the executive branch to release foreigners into the united states it is unclear whether the release will have any impact on the court lowercourt rulings have tied the hands of judges considering similar challenges from other prisoners at the base in cuba trial judges have granted petitions from more than two dozen detainees , of whom about 10 have been transferred to other countries four of the uighurs were moved in june to bermuda none of them have entered the united states lawyers for the obama administration , like those for the bush administration , have argued that the executive branch , not judges , has the authority to make decisions about whether to release detainees into the united states the possibility that any detainees might be moved to the united states to be set free , or even to be prosecuted , has provoked a storm of protest from members of congress from both parties lawmakers barred the obama administration from releasing any guant namo prisoners into the country more recently , congress kept in place the ban on releasing them but authorized transfers for prosecution in military or civilian courts president obama , in one of his first acts in office , ordered the prison closed by january 2010 , but administration officials have said they are unlikely to meet that deadline , mainly because of the problems in relocating detainees the uighurs were among nearly 100 detainees who had been cleared for transfers to other countries so far the administration has moved 25 of them
had waited nearly five years to win her second major tennis championship she had slogged through threeset matches fraught with anxiety during this 2009 tournament but on saturday morning in paris , kuznetsova made short work of the women s final against her fellow russian opponent , dinara safina she needed only 74 minutes to breeze through what was to be the hardest match yet , upending the topseeded safina with a 64 , 62 victory i have been waiting for this moment for a long time , losing to the winners , kuznetsova , a 23yearold from st petersburg , said in her bubbly english on philippe chatrier court when accepting the trophy i had been playing many matches , and this time it happened really , i did n't expect it to happen this year , at age 19 , kuznetsova had captured the 2004 us open championship , also over another fellow russian player , elena dementieva but she had twice finished as a runnerup in major tournaments , and had been known for squandering big leads this match had none of kuznetsova s trademark drama where she would seem to be in control only to fall behind , and then overcome her opponent again as she did in the threeset marathon quarterfinal match against serena williams earlier this week kuznetsova lost her serve on the first game of this match , but from there never lost her composure or control instead , it was safina , the younger sister of twotime major champion and infamous emotional player marat safin , who slammed her racquet to the clay court after she doublefaulted her seventh to give the match to kuznetsova safina , 23 , had shown little of the dominance she had exhibited in the spring season , when she had won 20 of her last 21 matches that one previous defeat was also to kuznetsova with an arsenal of tricky drop shots to go with her powerful groundstrokes that routinely wrongfooted safina , kuznetsova moved around the court with ease her leg strength might just be hereditary , since her mother is a sixtime world champion cyclist and her father a fivetime olympic coach her brother , nikolai , won a silver medal in the 1996 olympics in cycling kuznetsova seemed bouyed by meeting her idol , steffi graf , in the locker room before the match for the first time graf , a sixtime french open champion , was on hand to present kuznetstova the trophy a little more than an hour later , and the two hugged on court after thanking the crowd and her family , kuznetsova praised her fellow countrywoman , safina , and said that one day she would get that first major championship i guess today i played a little better , she said i am sorry for that
the car s engine roared as the gunman punched the accelerator and we crossed into the open afghan desert i was seated in the back between two afghan colleagues who were accompanying me on a reporting trip when armed men surrounded our car and took us hostage another gunman in the passenger seat turned and stared at us as he gripped his kalashnikov rifle no one spoke i glanced at the bleak landscape outside reddish soil and black boulders as far as the eye could see and feared we would be dead within minutes it was last nov 10 , and i had been headed to a meeting with a taliban commander along with an afghan journalist , tahir luddin , and our driver , asad mangal the commander had invited us to interview him outside kabul for reporting i was pursuing about afghanistan and pakistan the longer i looked at the gunman in the passenger seat , the more nervous i became his face showed little emotion his eyes were dark , flat and lifeless i thought of my wife and family and was overcome with shame an interview that seemed crucial hours earlier now seemed absurd and reckless i had risked the lives of tahir and asad as well as my own life we reached a dry riverbed and the car stopped they 're going to kill us , tahir whispered they 're going to kill us tahir and asad were ordered out of the car gunmen from a second vehicle began beating them with their rifle butts and led them away i was told to get out of the car and take a few steps up a sandcovered hillside while one guard pointed his kalashnikov at me , the other took my glasses , notebook , pen and camera i was blindfolded , my hands tied behind my back my heart raced sweat poured from my skin habarnigar , i said , using a dari word for journalist salaam , i said , using an arabic expression for peace i waited for the sound of gunfire i knew i might die but remained strangely calm moments later , i felt a hand push me back toward the car , and i was forced to lie down on the back seat two gunmen got in and slammed the doors shut the car lurched forward tahir and asad were gone and , i thought , probably dead the car came to a halt after what seemed like a twohour drive guards took off my blindfold and guided me through the front door of a crude mudbrick home perched in the center of a ravine i was put in some type of washroom the size of a closet after a few minutes , the guards opened the door and pushed tahir and asad inside we stared at one another in relief about 20 minutes later , a guard opened the door and motioned for us to walk into the hallway no shoot , he said , no shoot for the first time that day , i thought our lives might be spared the guard led us into a living room decorated with maroon carpets and red pillows a halfdozen men sat along two walls of the room , kalashnikov rifles at their sides i sat down across from a heavyset man with a patu a traditional afghan scarf wrapped around his face sunglasses covered his eyes , and he wore a cheap black knit winter cap embroidered across the front of it was the word rock in english i'm a taliban commander , he announced my name is mullah atiqullah for the next seven months and 10 days , atiqullah and his men kept the three of us hostage we were held in afghanistan for a week , then spirited to the tribal areas of pakistan , where osama bin laden is thought to be hiding atiqullah worked with sirajuddin haqqani , the leader of one of the most hardline factions of the taliban the haqqanis and their allies would hold us in territory they control in north and south waziristan during our time as hostages , i tried to reason with our captors i told them we were journalists who had come to hear the taliban s side of the story i told them that i had recently married and that tahir and asad had nine young children between them i wept , hoping it would create sympathy , and begged them to release us all of my efforts proved pointless over those months , i came to a simple realization after seven years of reporting in the region , i did not fully understand how extreme many of the taliban had become before the kidnapping , i viewed the organization as a form of al qaeda lite , a religiously motivated movement primarily focused on controlling afghanistan living side by side with the haqqanis' followers , i learned that the goal of the hardline taliban was far more ambitious contact with foreign militants in the tribal areas appeared to have deeply affected many young taliban fighters they wanted to create a fundamentalist islamic emirate with al qaeda that spanned the muslim world i had written about the ties between pakistan s intelligence services and the taliban while covering the region for the new york times i knew pakistan turned a blind eye to many of their activities but i was astonished by what i encountered firsthand a taliban ministate that flourished openly and with impunity the taliban government that had supposedly been eliminated by the 2001 invasion of afghanistan was alive and thriving
you may not have heard of hester santlow she is mentioned in few histories of dance or theater yet for 27 years in the early 18th century she outshone all other female dancers on the london stage and sparkled beside numerous visiting french male stars since some of her dances were recorded in the notation of that era , a number of baroque specialists in america and europe have worked on bringing them to life in recent decades i 've seen versions of them performed in new york and london history tends to remark most on her starring roles in three works by the dancing master john weaver their collaboration is the first i know of between male choreographer and inspiring female dancer that has subsequently become one of the most significant patterns in ballet they worked together on productions like the loves of mars and venus \( 1717 \) and the judgment of paris \( 1733 \) thanks to research in recent decades and to the writings he produced , weaver has acquired more fame he has recently been hailed as one of the first architects of dance drama and so , although none of his works for santlow survived , many attempts have been made to recreate or reimagine them , particularly in new york the current judgment of paris , by company xiv at duo theater in the east village , refers to marilyn monroe , marlene dietrich and jacques offenbach , with other music by arvo p rt , yet it is derived from weaver s version until weaver was so celebrated by 20thcentury dance history , santlow , who died in her 70s in 1773 , was largely forgotten certainly she was a muse who inspired him in her person , he wrote , art and nature have combin 'd to produce a beautiful figure , allow 'd by all judges to be the most graceful , most agreeable and most correct performer in the world but she was by no means his creation she was the most famous dancer in london long before their first collaboration , and her great celebrity constantly eclipsed his one of her specialties , for more than 20 years , was a harlequin dance \( her most famous portrait shows her in the dress from that work \) jed perl s recent book antoine s alphabet muses on jeanantoine watteau s fascination with harlequins santlow was watteau s contemporary , and her popularity was such that portraits of her in her harlequin costume sold widely on snuffboxes \( according to a german writer in 1710 \) another santlow specialty was to loosen her hair as she danced something that 250 years later became a device in several balanchine ballets her career overlapped that of daniel defoe , john vanbrugh , alexander pope , joseph addison and john gay and three successive british monarchs queen anne and kings george i and ii came to her benefit performances at drury lane theater in london for the last 23 years of her career she also doubled as a star actress she created roles in plays by susannah centlivre , charles shadwell and richard steele and portrayed a number of heroines in shakespeare works and restoration comedies hard as it is to imagine today , drury lane revived hamlet with essentially the same cast every year from 1710 to 1732 she was its main resident ophelia during that time in 1719 she married barton booth , who was drury lane s othello \( and , in hamlet , the ghost \) her enduring appeal comes across in a 1725 letter by james thomson , whose response to her is distinctly erotic mrs booth acts some things very well and particularly ophelia s madness in hamlet' inimitably , but then she dances so deliciously , has such melting lascivious motions , airs and postures as indeed according to what you suspect almost throw the material part of me into action too her life offstage was no less amazing rumor had it that john churchill , the first duke of marlborough and the general and politician , took her as his mistress at the height of his fame \( if so , she was the only woman so favored \) certainly she had an important relationship with james craggs the younger , a handsome politician who fought a duel for her honor in hyde park she and craggs had a daughter , harriot , who inheriting money from her father and his father , in turn , as well as from her prudent mother married into the aristocracy and santlow lived to see her daughter and grandchildren painted by joshua reynolds in 1990 i wrote an essay on santlow s career for the british magazine dancing times shortly afterward the magazine received a letter from a dance scholar , moira goff , who courteously pointed out that i had not investigated the most important evidence about santlow the notation of her dances quite right in subsequent years i have watched , with real delight , ms goff and other baroquedance experts performing the works made for santlow by choreographers other than weaver these dances are fascinating rich in footwork both elegant and witty , full of striking changes of direction that suggest great charm , and so unlike one another that they indicate that santlow was as much the exemplar of her art as weaver suggested women of that era wore long dresses , but santlow whose legs were so good that she often wore boy s cloaths \( to use the spelling of the day \) in plays must have found ways to show off her intricate footwork and jumps now that these dances keep returning to our stages , it s good to relate that ms goff has given us a book , the incomparable hester santlow a danceractress on the georgian stage \( ashgate , 2007 \) it exemplifies dance scholarship of a rare kind ms goff spent 20 years investigating even the slightest details of santlow s life and career and wrote about her dances from experience , step by step , and with feeling it avoids any sensationalism ms goff is inclined to rescue santlow from every adverse rumor though i could argue some of her points , my only reservation about her book is that she too seldom gives santlow s story its full resonance by placing it in context of the london of her era but the book s detail is marvelous i laughed to learn from it that santlow \( then married \) played ophelia on the night of her daughter s wedding , an achievement few other ophelias could have matched here is one sensational point that ms goff omits santlow had extremely illustrious progeny by way of that illegitimate daughter , harriot , she is the ancestor of the actress jane asher six of britain s current dukes several of margaret thatcher s cabinet ministers diana , princess of wales and sarah ferguson , once married to prince andrew as well as all of their offspring royalty made an express issue of attending santlow s benefit performances , and now when some of her descendants go to the theater , they sit in the royal box diana liked to say that she once wanted to be a ballerina i regret that i never wrote to her to explain that it may have been in her blood
jenin , west bank in recent days , some have questioned whether secretary of state hillary clinton was making a big mistake in appointing so many special envoys , such as george mitchell , to handle key trouble spots , like the israelipalestinian conflict i think they are right to question mrs clinton about this plethora of envoys but i do n't think the problem is that she has too many it s that she does n't have enough in the case of the israelipalestinian conflict , she may need at least a halfdozen envoys actually , this conflict is now broken into so many different pieces it may take a whole state department of its own to resolve it in addition to mitchell , hillary may want to enlist bill and chelsea to take a crack at solving this one , definitely jim baker and jimmy carter , too why , heck , she might want to even ask some perfect strangers she meets in the halls at foggy bottom hey , would you like a free trip to the middle east \? sure , it helps to know some history , but a grasp of biology now is even more useful like how an amoeba reproduces by constantly splitting itself in half where to begin \? palestinians are now divided between the west bank and gaza , with a secular palestinian authority based in ramallah in the west bank and a fundamentalist hamas government based in gaza but hamas is further divided between a military and political wing , and the political wing is further divided between a gazabased leadership and a damascusbased leadership , with the latter taking orders from both syria and iran are you still with me \? best i can tell , the palestinians from gaza are simultaneously negotiating a ceasefire with israel in cairo , pursuing warcrimes charges against israel in europe , digging new tunnels in the sinai to smuggle more rockets into gaza to hit tel aviv and trying to raise money for reconstruction from iran meanwhile , the west bank palestinian leaders are busy publicly collecting food and blankets to help all those palestinian civilians brutalized by the israeli incursion into gaza , while privately demanding to know from senior israeli officials why they wimped out and did n't wipe hamas in gaza off the face of earth casualties be damned israel , meanwhile , has a government in which the prime minister , foreign minister and defense minister each has a different peace plan , war strategy and ceasefire conditions for gaza , and the foreign minister and defense minster are running against each other in israel s election on tuesday speaking of that election , a whole new party , yisrael beiteinu , led by avigdor lieberman , which has been accused of having fascist , viciously antiarab leanings , appears headed to make the biggest gains and possibly become the kingmaker of israel s next government the other day , the labor party leader , ehud barak , was quoted in the newspaper haaretz as criticizing lieberman as a lamb in hawk s clothing , asking when has he ever shot anyone \? how did this conflict get so fragmented \? for starters , it s gone on way too long the west bank is so chopped up and divided now by roads , checkpoints and fences to separate israel s crazy settlements from palestinian villages that a palestinian could fly from jerusalem to paris quicker than he or she could drive from jenin , here in the northern west bank , to hebron in the south another reason is that every idea has been tried and has failed for the palestinians , panarabism , communism , islamism have all come and gone , with none having delivered statehood or prosperity as a result , more and more palestinians have fallen back on family , clan , town and tribal loyalties in israel , peace now s twostate solution was blown up with the crash of the oslo peace accords , the rising palestinian birthrate made any plans to annex the west bank a mortal threat to israel s jewish character , and the rockets that followed israel s withdrawals from both lebanon and gaza made a mockery of those who said unilateral pullouts were the solution all of this has led to a resurgence of religiosity according to haaretz , the following questions were posed by a wellknown rabbi in one of the pamphlets distributed by the israeli army s office of chief rabbi before the latest gaza fighting is it possible to compare today s palestinians to the philistines of the past \? and if so , is it possible to apply lessons today from the military tactics of samson and david \? a comparison is possible because the philistines of the past were not natives and had invaded from a foreign land who in the world would want to try to repair this \? i 'd rather herd cats , or become john thain s image adviser , or have a colonoscopy , or become chairman of the bad bank that president obama might create to hold all the toxic mortgages surely , any of those would be more fun if mitchell is still up for it , well , then god bless him my next column will look at some ways we might just start over
new haven since the vietnam war , rotc programs have been banned from operating on campus at elite universities like yale and harvard these institutions have also long hindered the military s efforts to recruit their students but in march 2006 , the supreme court ruled unanimously that the military must be allowed back on all campuses the door is open more important , the students themselves are ready i recently taught a course on the obligations of citizenship at yale , where i also spent three years as a law student if my university holds some prejudice against military service , its students , in my experience , do n't seem to the studentrun yale political union recently approved a resolution to invite rotc back on campus several promilitary organizations have sprung up , including the semper fi society , which helps undergraduates become marine corps officers while it is true that few of the students i taught will ever serve in uniform , part of the reason is that no one has bothered to ask them to to change that , our new commander in chief should order the military to activate new rotc units then president obama should direct it to step up inperson recruiting efforts on these campuses tv commercials showing marines scaling mountains will not work on yale students but programs like teach for america have great success recruiting from ivy league colleges , because their recruiters are given time at the end of large lectures to deliver their pitch if the military demands similar access , students will respond imagine asking a 21yearold how would you like to go somewhere where you are the person who is capable of helping \? my students were desperate to serve their country in some way we owe it to them to offer the armed forces as a realistic option but rebuilding a connection between america s military and its most selective colleges is about more than providing exceptional opportunities to exceptional young people it is , ultimately , about our military s relationship to its civilian leaders at yale , which has supplied more than its share of senators and presidents , almost none of my former classmates or students ever noticed the absence of uniforms on campus in a nation at war , this is a disgrace but it also shows how dangerously out of touch the elites who shape our national policy have become with the men and women they send to war whenever i encounter animus toward the military at yale , it is almost always born of ignorance students often cite the do n't ask , do n't tell policy on gays in the military as a justification for the ban on rotc they are far more sympathetic when i explain that such policies are enacted by congress , and that the military has no choice but to comply toward the end of the semester , i took my class to west point none of my students had ever seen a military base , and only one had a friend his age in uniform but every one of them was deeply respectful of what they saw my students understood that many of the cadets they met would soon be at war and without my saying it , they also knew that the decisions leading to war are made by elite civilians like themselves as a candidate , barack obama called top colleges' rejection of the military a mistake as president , he can begin to correct that mistake by ordering the military to invest in new rotc units and redouble campus recruiting efforts the door is finally open , but it is up to our commander in chief to lead us through
it is great to be in denver i was here last summer to accept the nomination of my party and to make a promise to people of all parties that i would do all i could to give every american the chance to make of their lives what they will and see their children climb higher than they did i am back today to say that we have begun the difficult work of keeping that promise we have begun the essential work of keeping the american dream alive in our time today does not mark the end of our economic troubles nor does it constitute all of what we must do to turn our economy around but it does mark the beginning of the end the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs to provide relief for families worried they wo n't be able to pay next month s bills and to set our economy on a firmer foundation , paving the way to longterm growth and prosperity the american recovery and reinvestment act that i will sign today a plan that meets the principles i laid out in january is the most sweeping economic recovery package in our history it is the product of broad consultations and the recipient of broad support from business leaders , unions , and public interest groups , the chamber of commerce , the national association of manufacturers , democrats and republicans , mayors as well as governors it is a rare thing in washington for people with such different viewpoints to come together and support the same bill , and on behalf of our nation , i thank them for it , including your two outstanding new senators , michael bennet and mark udall i also want to thank my vice president joe biden for working behind the scenes from the very start to make this recovery act possible i want to thank speaker pelosi and harry reid for acting so quickly and proving that congress could step up to this challenge i want to thank max baucus , chairman of the finance committee , without whom none of this would have happened and i want to thank all the committee chairs and members of congress for coming up with a plan that is both bold and balanced enough to meet the demands of this moment the american people were looking to them for leadership , and that is what they provided what makes this recovery plan so important is not just that it will create or save three and a half million jobs over the next two years , including nearly 60 , 000 in colorado it s that we are putting americans to work doing the work that america needs done in critical areas that have been neglected for too long work that will bring real and lasting change for generations to come because we know we ca n't build our economic future on the transportation and information networks of the past , we are remaking the american landscape with the largest new investment in our nation s infrastructure since eisenhower built an interstate highway system in the 1950s because of this investment , nearly 400 , 000 men and women will go to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges , repairing our faulty dams and levees , bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in america , upgrading mass transit , and building highspeed rail lines that will improve travel and commerce throughout the nation because we know america ca n't outcompete the world tomorrow if our children are being outeducated today , we are making the largest investment in education in our nation s history it s an investment that will create jobs building 21st century classrooms , libraries , and labs for millions of children across america it will provide funds to train a new generation of math and science teachers , while giving aid to states and school districts to stop teachers from being laid off and education programs from being cut in new york city alone , 14 , 000 teachers who were set to be let go may now be able to continue pursuing their critical mission it s an investment that will create a new 2 , 500 annual tax credit to put the dream of a college degree within reach for middle class families and make college affordable for seven million students , helping more of our sons and daughters aim higher , reach farther , and fulfill their godgiven potential because we know that spiraling health care costs are crushing families and businesses alike , we are taking the most meaningful steps in years towards modernizing our health care system it s an investment that will take the long overdue step of computerizing america s medical records to reduce the duplication and waste that costs billions of health care dollars and the medical errors that every year cost thousands of lives further , thanks to the action we have taken , seven million americans who lost their health care along with their jobs will continue to get the coverage they need , and roughly 20 million more can breathe a little easier , knowing that their health care wo n't be cut due to a state budget shortfall and an historic commitment to wellness initiatives will keep millions of americans from setting foot in the doctor s office for purely preventable diseases taken together with the enactment earlier this month of a longdelayed law to extend health care to millions more children of working families , we have done more in 30 days to advance the cause of health reform than this country has done in a decade because we know we ca n't power america s future on energy that s controlled by foreign dictators , we are taking a big step down the road to energy independence , and laying the groundwork for a new , green energy economy that can create countless wellpaying jobs it s an investment that will double the amount of renewable energy produced over the next three years , and provide tax credits and loan guarantees to companies like namaste solar , a company that will be expanding , instead of laying people off , as a result of the plan i am signing in the process , we will transform the way we use energy today , the electricity we use is carried along a grid of lines and wires that dates back to thomas edison a grid that ca n't support the demands of clean energy this means we 're using 19th and 20th century technologies to battle 21st century problems like climate change and energy security it also means that places like north dakota can produce a lot of wind energy , but ca n't deliver it to communities that want it , leading to a gap between how much clean energy we are using and how much we could be using the investment we are making today will create a newer , smarter electric grid that will allow for the broader use of alternative energy we will build on the work that s being done in places like boulder , colorado a community that is on pace to be the world s first smart grid city this investment will place smart meters in homes to make our energy bills lower , make outages less likely , and make it easier to use clean energy it s an investment that will save taxpayers over one billion dollars by slashing energy costs in our federal buildings by 25 and save working families hundreds of dollars a year on their energy bills by weatherizing over one million homes and it s an investment that takes the important first step towards a nationwide transmission superhighway that will connect our cities to the windy plains of the dakotas and the sunny deserts of the southwest even beyond energy , from the national institutes of health to the national science foundation , this recovery act represents the biggest increase in basic research funding in the long history of america s noble endeavor to better understand our world just as president kennedy sparked an explosion of innovation when he set america s sights on the moon , i hope this investment will ignite our imagination once more , spurring new discoveries and breakthroughs that will make our economy stronger , our nation more secure , and our planet safer for our children while this package is mostly composed of critical investments , it also includes aid to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of firefighters or police recruits recruits like the ones in columbus , ohio who were told that instead of being swornin as officers , they would be let go it includes help for those hardest hit by our economic crisis like the nearly 18 million americans who will get larger unemployment checks in the mail and about a third of this package comes in the form of tax cuts the most progressive in our history not only spurring jobcreation , but putting money in the pockets of 95 of all hardworking families unlike tax cuts we 've seen in recent years , the vast majority of these tax benefits will go not to the wealthiest americans but to the middle class with those workers who make the least benefiting the most and it s a plan that rewards responsibility , lifting two million americans from poverty by ensuring that anyone who works hard does not have to raise a child below the poverty line as a whole , this plan will help poor and working americans pull themselves into the middle class in a way we have n't seen in nearly fifty years what i am signing , then , is a balanced plan with a mix of tax cuts and investments it is a plan that s been put together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending and it is a plan that will be implemented with an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability with a recovery package of this scale comes a responsibility to assure every taxpayer that we are being careful with the money they work so hard to earn that s why i am assigning a team of managers to ensure that the precious dollars we have invested are being spent wisely and well we will hold the governors and local officials who receive money to the same high standards and we expect you , the american people , to hold us accountable for the results that is why we have created recoverygov so every american can go online and see how their money is being spent as important as the step we take today is , this legislation represents only the first part of the broad strategy we need to address our economic crisis in the coming days and weeks , i will be launching other aspects of the plan we will need to stabilize , repair , and reform our banking system , and get credit flowing again to families and businesses we will need to end a culture where we ignore problems until they become fullblown crises instead of recognizing that the only way to build a thriving economy is to set and enforce firm rules of the road we must stem the spread of foreclosures and falling home values for all americans , and do everything we can to help responsible homeowners stay in their homes , something i will talk more about tomorrow and while we need to do everything in the shortterm to get our economy moving again , we must recognize that having inherited a trilliondollar deficit , we need to begin restoring fiscal discipline and taming our exploding deficits over the longterm none of this will be easy the road to recovery will not be straight and true it will demand courage and discipline , and a new sense of responsibility that has been missing from wall street to washington there will be hazards and reverses along the way but i have every confidence that if we are willing to continue doing the difficult work that must be done by each of us and by all of us then we will leave this struggling economy behind us , and come out on the other side , more prosperous as a people for our american story is not and has never been about things coming easy it s about rising to the moment when the moment is hard , converting crisis into opportunity , and seeing to it that we emerge from whatever trials we face stronger than we were before it s about rejecting the notion that our fate is somehow written for us , and instead laying claim to a destiny of our own making that is what earlier generations of americans have done , and that is what we are doing today thank you
by providing financial institutions with enough capital to survive \( and even thrive \) over the past year , the federal government prevented the global economy from grinding to a halt but it may also have unwittingly encouraged banks to slow the resolution of delinquent , defaulted and underwater loans secured by homes and commercial real estate such extend and pretend behavior does little except delay losses which helps explain the recent crop of predictionbeating , marketrallying bank earnings reports while prolonging and worsening the damage done by bad loans just this week , the white house met with a gaggle of mortgage company executives to discuss why their loan modification programs have been so ineffective in fact , a by the national bureau of economic research illustrates that these programs have n't been ineffective so much as unused only 8 percent of seriously delinquent borrowers have received any form of mortgage modification and fewer than 3 percent of such borrowers received a concession on principal or interest payments from their lender by contrast , about 50 percent of those seriously delinquent loans had foreclosure proceedings initiated against them that s a record rate of 19 million foreclosure filings in the first half of this year banks , of course , typically lose more money by foreclosing on a home than by renegotiating the principal of a loan but , as foreclosure timelines often run 12 to 18 months , that loss takes far longer to show up on their balance sheets as a result , banks are pushing the mess \( and the attendant additional losses \) well into 2010 while they maintain the fiction that borrowers will be able to repay severely underwater loans in full banks are even beginning to turn down borrower requests for immediate short sales , in which homeowners sell for whatever they can get and then give all proceeds to the lender , because this , too , means that the bank must record a principal loss at once , rather than down the road the sheer magnitude of the debt bubble doubling to 11 trillion in home loans and adding tens of trillions in total american debt in the past decade along with the collapse of real estate prices , make it extremely unlikely that any of these houses will recover their value soon enough to mitigate the losses embedded in banks' balance sheets and by stretching out the time over which banks will continue to have their capitalization hit by losses , banks cannot soon fulfill their mission of providing new capital for the recovery and growth of the economy fearing for their own solvency , banks are instead salting away enormous , recordsetting reserves to put the bubble behind us , we need to place mortgage lenders on a path to settling up with underwater homeowners one of the few viable ways to do this is for banks to accept the voluntary surrender of deeds and then lease the homes back to their former owners the former homeowners should then retain a right to purchase their homes back at fair market value , after , say , five years , during which time they would need to get their financial affairs in order congress could pass legislation , within the bounds of constitutional protection of contracts , that would require lenders to provide such a leaseback arrangement to any borrower who wants one the former homeowners would pay rents set in accordance with local rates \( which in almost all cases would be considerably lower than the total of their former bubbleera mortgage payments , taxes and insurance premiums \) homes subject to such leaseback arrangements might also enjoy some unique tax benefits , like accelerated depreciation , and be eligible for mortgage financing from fannie mae , freddie mac or the federal housing administration this would spur an investment market that would help lenders get the properties off their balance sheets by attracting investment in leasedback homes those homeowners who are gainfully employed and less underwater require a different solution the administration needs to move beyond a policy encouraging mere payment modifications and toward one pushing hard for a renegotiation of principal based on lower , postbubble values in exchange , lenders would share in any eventual sales profits a restructuring similar to the debtforequity swaps imposed by the government on some creditors of general motors and chrysler if banks ca n't bring themselves to do that , then the loans should be sold to those of us in the private sector who will that s what the firm i work for is already doing buying the few distressed loans banks will sell and offering principal modifications that help keep people in their homes i realize i am proposing the biggest controlled debt restructuring in history , and i expect none of these suggestions will be welcomed by banks , which would be forced to recognize their losses sooner rather than later nevertheless , banks need to be freed of the bad loans embedded in their balance sheets if not for their need or willingness to do so , than for the economy s need to have it done
other oscar bloggers are more experienced \( like tom o neil \) , more beloved \( sasha stone \) or more schooled in cinema \( kris tapley \) , but none of them gets invited every year to an oscar party in sweden each year , christina jeurling makes sure that the bagger receives a lovely handcrafted invite in the year departed won , there was a lovely take on martin scorsese as a kind of puppet action figure , last year s was a mobile that used some strikethemed art , and this year s design is an electoral motif with amazing little custom buttons for each best picture nominee the bagger says thanks again for the invite to the hoedown , which starts at 2 am swedish time but right now he is scheduled to glimpse the oscars from a press room deep in the recesses of the kodak theater , while fetching sodas for the guys who are going to do the actual work come to think of it , sweden sounds great this time of year
kennedy we have a wonderful turnout of the members of the committee , and we have an extraordinary panel here that has had an incredible life and commitment to health and human services , and we are just delighted that they 're here we 'll look forward to what their statement or testimony , and then we 'll we 'll proceed with senator our senators right after that so we will recognize senator dole first \( unknown \) we 're going to ask senator johnson to go first , if that s ok kennedy fine that s that s they 're starting with their strong man here we here we go , and the johnson johnson thank you , senator good call kennedy always good to hear you , and we 're very , very appreciative of your presence here and your excellent work in the senate thank you johnson i'm still uncertain , so chairman kennedy , senator enzi and members of the committee , i'm so pleased to introduce my good friend and former colleague , tom daschle , as the health committee considers his nomination for secretary of health and human services i 've watched and admired tom s career in public service for many years i remember his first campaign for congress in 1978 , the same year as my first run for the \( inaudible \) legislature during the past 22 years , tom has become one of my closest friends and in my world as his deep dedication to service , relentless work ethic and unending commitment to serving the people of our home state and our nation now tom has been called upon to return to public service as secretary of health and human services i know known our country will be a better place because tom chose to answer that call his passion for ensuring that all americans have access to quality health care is second to none with tom s unique understanding of the many problems plaguing health care in america and his commitment to solving them with fresh ideas , we have our first chance to actually improve health care for all americans i urge the members of this committee and my senate colleagues to confirm tom daschle s nomination so that we can all get to work reforming health care in america thank you kennedy thank you very much i really appreciate taking the time to be with us , senator and now we 'll hear from senator dole dole it s obviously a privilege to be here with my friend , tom daschle , and with tim and we are both tim has made his statement , and mine is very short , but we want to underscore not only tom s qualifications , but the importance of the job he s going to assume when he s confirmed and so this is a very as i understand it the first hearing that s been held on any of presidentelect obama s nominees let me first say to senator johnson that it s good to be with you and i speak personally how everyone is tremendously proud of your meeting a difficult challenge and making a recovery that inspired and gave hope to everyone , particularly those in the disabled communities so it s an honor to be with you and and also with the chairman , senator kennedy i'm here today , as i said , as a friend and a former colleague i served with tom for 10 years , including two years when we both served as our party s leader before i left voluntarily in 1996 so i 've had a long a decade of working with tom and and in and out of the senate on a number of issues , such as agriculture and energy and health care and trade and many more and i can testify not only to his expertise on issues , but most importantly i think to the american people and the people he 'll be dealing with and his colleagues and former colleagues in the senate and the house is tom s integrity and fairness , which i think gives everybody confidence , even though you may not agree on a particular issue we 're now in the same law firm , alston bird , where he works and i just show up and in addition to advising clients and hosting events and telling people what we think we know about the political process , we 've traveled around the country together discussing issues of the day we both pretty much know each other s lines we 're not a threat to leno or letterman or anybody , but tom should tell you his one story about the model senator i think it s very good , and i know they 'd appreciate it but along with our former colleagues at the present time , senator baker and senator mitchell and myself and senator daschle , we 've worked for two years in what we in the bipartisan policy center , and the goal is to address a few of the major important challenges and where possible reach meaningful consensus , along with recommendations that we think might be received by members of the congress and both parties add for the past nine months working with the bipartisan policy panel , senator daschle and i with senator baker and mitchell have been working on health care reform and baker and mitchell and myself will have to finish the job , because tom will be in another position , but we hope we can adopt some recommendations that will have will resonate with many in the congress and those who have a direct interest , as well as the american people and i can we all know from past experience it s a very difficult issue , and we probably wo n't find agreement on everything but we certainly appreciated tom s hard work , his views he s written a book on health care , and he s been a tireless worker in this area for as long as i can remember he also recently worked on another bipartisan effort with another former senate majority leader , senator bill frist , on the one vote '08 campaign addressing health and poverty in developing countries as most of you know , senator daschle has spent a good part of his career focused on health care he has demonstrated his interest in leading the health on health care throughout his career in both the house and the senate as i have said , he s written a book entitled critical on reforming the system what is important is that the presidentelect has selected an individual who begins the important task of reforming health care with , one , the ability to hit the ground running , because tom knows this forwards and backwards , and he really understands almost as well as staff experts most of the issues when it comes to health care , and secondly , i think the fact that he understands congress if anybody understands congress , it s tom daschle , serving eight years in the house and having been in the senate and being the only senator to ever serve twice as both majority and minority leaders in the senate and he enjoyed being majority leader more but senator daschle and i both believe politics is an honorable profession he is a role model to many , because he he knows how we got here he knows who he is , and he has not forgotten his legion of friends in south dakota , who sent him here i had a call from george mcgovern , fellow south dakotan , just two days ago , telling him talk about being here to introduce senator daschle and what a privilege it was , and he wanted me to express his best wishes and thoughts and i know you 're longtime friends , and senator mcgovern has done a great job in the area of international coping with domestic and international hunger so i was around here for quite a while , and i have a sense that the time has come for real constructive bipartisan action on health care the american people and congress are ready to address this particular issue about the uninsured and accessibility , affordability , the spiraling costs and if you feel as we do , we have a nominee who understands bipartisanship is best in the long range , even though with the big democratic majority , he may not need republicans but i think it it goes beyond numbers so i just again thank the committee for letting me appear on behalf of my good friend , and i wish you all a happy new year and look forward to what others may have to say thank you kennedy thank you very much , senator dole , for your words and we welcome your staying remaining for the committee s hearings we understand you have other responsibilities as well , so thank you very , very much for for being here the way we 're going to proceed is i 'll make a brief opening statement senator enzi will make a statement and then we 'll hear from senator daschle , who will speak and then we 'll go through the members of the committee we are very broad membership here today and what we 'll do is start off with at least five minutes as opening statements , and then we 'll continue to move along as other members members come here kennedy so it is a honor to welcome our members to our first hearing of the new congress i particularly welcome our very special witness today , a valued friend and a former colleague tom daschle is a leader of great integrity and strong dedication he has served this nation with distinction both in uniform and in the senate he has admirers all across the country and on both sides of the aisle i commend presidentelect obama for selecting such an extraordinary nominee to lead the nation s health care agenda tom daschle understands the urgency and the challenge of health reform he knows that americans feel the heavy weight of rising costs he knows that families are afraid that they will lose their health insurance and he knows that 46 million americans do not have health insurance at all reform is urgently needed and tom daschle is just the person for the job in considering health care reform , the fundamental question before us was once expressed in words far more eloquent than my own will we honor the unique american ideal that we are responsible for passing this country on to a generation in the future \? is that better \? or will we forfeit the promise of the future for the reward of the moment \? those are not my words they are the words of an extraordinary senate leader as he said farewell to the senate four years ago we must answer that question by taking action now to provide affordable and quality health care for all americans senator daschle , welcome to our committee and i look forward to your early confirmation as the secretary of health and human services thank you for being here senator enzi \? enzi mr chairman i want to welcome you back to the committee and congratulate you on being the first to hold a hearing on presidentelect obama s nominees that s typical senator kennedy fashion to get right into it right away be first but i also want to thank you for the time while you were gone , the way that you distributed the workload among the members of the committee so that we could continue on the important things that we 've gotten done and i particularly want to thank and congratulate senator mikulski for her tremendous work on the higher education act kennedy yes enzi she was a great catalyst and a real staunch promoter of getting that done and as a result we did and that was due to your leadership i know that the members of this committee take the advice and consent clause of the constitution seriously and i was pleased to learn that the health committee had an aggressive hearing schedule on the important cabinet level positions that 'll come through this committee i 'd also like to congratulate senator daschle on his appointment and welcome this former colleague and member of this institution when former senators come before this institution for confirmation it s similar i hope to returning home to family in a way i understand that the senate finance committee on which senator daschle served while he was a member of this body , has the primary jurisdiction over this nomination to head the department of health and human services but because of the overlap in our work and in fact we do probably more in that area i think than the finance committee does , the number of federal programs which the health committee authorizes that are administered by health and human services , the health committee has established this tradition of holding a hearing on this cabinet level position and i appreciate you participating in it i would mention that since 2001 , the health committee held hearings on both the nominations of former secretaries tommy thompson and on mike leavitt in january 2001 and 2005 , respectively both of these nominees were confirmed within two weeks of their hearing before this committee so the health committee , particularly senator kennedy and i have established a track record or working quickly on this front senator kennedy and i also have a track record of finding solutions for problems americans face on domestic policy front , we try to work together when possible to write legislation that focuses on what we can agree on not what divides us that s what we refer to as the 80 percent rule 80 percent of the issues the senate generally agrees on while the remaining 20 percent are divisive and the subject of disputes on the senate floor and the same works with any bill usually there s 80 percent we can agree on and another 20 percent that we could discuss forever we prefer to get the 80 percent done so as we begin this nomination hearing today i want to express my hope that senator daschle and i will have a strong working relationship as will our staff and as will other members of the committee there are going to be areas in which we disagree but my hope and expectation is that by focusing on solutions we can produce meaningful results for hardworking americans that meet the 80 percent rule and do it through the committee process our health care system is broken and fixing its one area where i hope this 80 percent rule comes into play so commonsense reforms can be made the american people deserve solutions not just debate i 've read senator daschle s health care book and appreciate both the history and the direction in fact , i 've directed my staff to read the book as well many of them have i know that we have a shared commitment to reducing the number of uninsured americans , containing costs , improving quality and making health care more accessible to everyone we got to speak earlier in the month and then considerably longer a few days ago and we 've gotten to talk about both his book and my 10 steps to transform health care which is on my web site which is a collection of ideas that i 've gathered across the aisle from people so while we do n't always agree and wo n't always agree , we have both put concrete health care proposals on the table for discussion previously now my hope and expectation is that in this congress we 'll focus on legislating solutions that 'll make a difference in people s lives while most importantly abiding by the golden rule to do no harm to that end , i have a series of questions which we 'll begin once the question and answer portion of the hearing and then a host of followup questions for the record and in the spirit of helping to accelerate your nomination , i would appreciate your quick response and know that you 'll do that in closing i 'd like to again welcome chairman kennedy back to the committee and the senate and thank you for calling this hearing today kennedy thank you , senator enzi as always , you 're gracious in extending your warm welcome and i thank you for your continued opportunity to work with you on so many of these issues that are important to our whole constitution it s my desire to introduce each of

you very much for your courtesy and for giving me the opportunity to be with you today and i must say how wonderful it is to see you in that chair again kennedy thank you very much t daschle i thank you and i thank senator enzi for the opportunity to talk about an issue that we care so deeply about and before i get into my statement , let me just thank my family especially for being here as they are and for all of the support and affection and encouragement that they 've given me over these past few weeks and months it has meant everything to me it also means a great deal that two very , very close and dear friends could be here to introduce me tim and i have known each other for well over 30 years in so many different stages in life and i'm honored to call him one of my best friends and i am grateful for the extraordinary leadership and partnership that he has he has shown south dakota these many , many years bob dole has gone the extra mile to show what it is to be friends with somebody on the other side of the aisle he has reached out to me from the very beginning when i came to the senate , when i became leader when i left the senate , he was the very first person to come to be to talk about postsenate life and he has been my partner as he said for four years at the law firm and i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate that friendship he mentioned this line we do we 've kind of adopted when he s not around , i use his lines and i do n't think he s ever had to use mine but we talk about i was introduced once as a model politician and a model legislation and a model south dakotan linda showed me the word model as it s defined in the dictionary and there it s defined as a small replica of the real thing and \( laughter \) well in the best sense of the word , bob dole is a model friend and somebody that i have admired and will continue to admire the rest of my life i want to thank all of my former colleagues and friends on the committee dais as well from keeping our food and medicine safe to tracking infectious diseases , to helping families in need , to researching the cures of tomorrow , to providing care to underserved populations the department of health and human services has a significant role to play in keeping america healthy this department will also be central to tackling one of the greatest challenges of our time , reforming the us health care system the flaws in our health system are pervasive and corrosive they threaten our health and economic security and that is why the presidentelect has crafted the new white house office of health reform and i'm honored to be chosen to serve in this role as well if confirmed , i will use these dual roles to marshal the talent and energy necessary to at last succeed in making health care affordable and accessible for all americans i'm grateful to the presidentelect for putting his trust in me and i look forward to returning to public service at a pivotal moment in american history let me begin by again reiterating my gratitude to our chair and ranking member by testifying on the subject of health care before ted kennedy feels a bit like talking about one s trumpetplaying skills in front of louis armstrong and senator enzi , while he may not have been here the same number of years as senator kennedy , has been an effective voice in sounding the call for change through his leadership on the committee as well as i know it is for many of you , health care is personal to me i ran for congress 30 years ago to help places like rural south dakota where people sometimes went without proper health care because the nearest doctor s office was too far away when i came to the senate i had the privilege of serving with many of you and working on significant health care legislation including covering millions of children through the children s health insurance program , improving the ability to workers to keep their health insurance if they lost or changed a job and ensuring that advances in genetics did n't lead to health and employment discrimination when i left the senate i was able to travel around the country talking to businesses and community groups , people i met about what was broken in our health care system and cowrote a book called critical about how i thought we might fix it while our investments in research and pioneering work by our scientists lead innovation , too often patients do n't actually get our best in 1994 , we had 37 million americans who were uninsured today that number is 46 million in 1987 , one dollar out of 15 went toward health care for the average family today , it s one out of six t daschle presidentelect obama recognizes that many of you have been working for many years on these issues and that any effort at reform will require very close cooperation with congress he also realizes that change cannot be dictated from the white house or from washington out , but must come from the grassroots of this country and involve as many americans as possible in the process of reform in addition to being collaborative , it also needs to be an open , transparent process where people know their voices are being heard we 've already begun to listen during the transition we reached millions of americans via our web site changegov to get their input on how best to change our health care system tens of thousands of americans shared their greatest concerns about health reform , and thousands more open their homes to host health care community discussions we are currently compiling their reports to share with each of you and the presidentelect and everyone else but one thing was crystal clear america cannot afford more of the same when it comes to health care in this country , and i hope on this we can all agree it is unacceptable that in a nation of approximately 300 million people , nearly one in six americans do n't have health insurance as we face a harsh and deep recession , the problem of the uninsured is likely to grow but the number of uninsured only describes part of the problem even americans who do do have health insurance do n't always get the care they need , especially highvalue preventative care in some cases this is due to a shortage of providers , especially primary care providers in rural areas that we must work to address in other cases it is simply because our health care system is not oriented towards prevention and therefore fails to incentivize the screenings and lifestyle changes that can do so much to improve health any health care reform plan must make sure that every american has preventative care that prevents disease and disability coverage after you get sick should be a second line of defense today it s often the first line in addition to being sound medicine , this is sound fiscal policy studies have shown that for every dollar spent on prevention could actually net a return of 560 in health care costs , totaling upwards of 16 billion annually within five years but it s not enough to give every american care it needs to be highquality care by some measures nearly onethird of the care of americans receive is at best inadequate and at worst harmful disparities in access and quality produce disparities in outcomes on the pine ridge reservation in south dakota , onehalf of the people over 40 have diabetes , and the life expectancy today is just 47 years , what life expectancy was for the rest of the country in 1900 this , too , is unacceptable we need to make sure that every american gets highquality care , and if you see fit to support my nomination , i 'll make sure this goal includes the indian health service but even if every american had good insurance and great care , we 'd still have an overwhelming problem related to health costs over the past nine years , health insurance premiums rose three times faster than inflation the fact that health care premiums have doubled in the last eight years piece for some families to make the awful choice between health insurance and rent or heat and food and these cost increases are as unsustainable for our national budget as they are for our families' budget by 2025 the congressional budget office projects that health care will account for 25 percent of our gdp by comparison the entire federal budget today is about 20 percent of gdp any health care reform plan must achieve three goals of increasing access and quality while containing costs but helping to develop a successful plan is only part of what the next secretary of health and human services must do i believe the agencies of the department of health and human services can do a great deal to promote a system of wellness rather than a system of acute care , from the laboratory bench to the bedside take the example of heart disease research funded by the nih led to drugs approved by the fda , which together with the prevention promoted by cdc have helped cut deaths from heart disease in this country by half now , we must do the same for other chronic and preventable conditions , and i want to assure that congress and the american people that as we make determination about what is safe and what is not , what is effective and what is not , we will be guided by evidence and effectiveness , not by ideology finally , let me say that the department will remain dedicated to performing all of its vital services , ensuring our medical systems are prepared to respond to natural disasters , strengthening our public health system , working to improve the healthy development of our children to head start , confronting the challenge of longterm care for the elderly , working with states on child support enforcement and providing assistance to people with disabilities especially in these difficult economic times , the human services function of health and human services will continue to be a lifeline for many americans so that equals or i began , with the need to reform our system when health care reform collapsed in 1994 , i remember all the criticism people had after the fact they said that it took too long they said the process was too opaque they said the plan was too hard to understand , and they said the changes felt too dramatic these are good arguments for undertaking reform in a way that is aggressive , open and responsive to american concerns , but they 're not good arguments for ignoring the problem one of my favorite quotes is from nelson mandela referring to an end to apartheid , he once said , some things seem impossible until they are done he could have been talking about health care reform , because for generations now it has seemed an impossible goal but this time the cost of failure is simply too high this time working together , democrats and republicans can show it no longer has to be impossible this time it can be done thank you , mr chairman , and members of the committee i 'd be happy to take your questions kennedy well , thank you very much , senator daschle , for really a superb statement and review of the central challenges that we face as a country i 'll ask just a few questions , and then we 'll move on , going back and forth on the on our committee first of all , you 've taken some time recently to do a listening session all across the country about what the needs are in this country on health care i thought you might just review what you 've found during the past several months and weeks that you 've been doing this hearing across the the country can you tell us a little bit of what you 've seen , what you found , any stories or interesting comments that you might want to make on that \? t daschle well , mr chairman , it was it was just a wonderful opportunity to hear directly from the people in all parts of the country , all 50 states over 8 , 500 people offered to host these community discussions in their homes we had over 4 , 000 people , who reported from those discussions i attended a couple of them myself , one in durbin , indiana , in a firehouse i can recall what the police chief what the fire chief said , as we asked him how it was that he could accommodate all of the concerns that he had just outlined with regard to providing meaningful health care in a rural community like durbin , indiana and the fire chief started by simply saying , you know we just kind of concluded that we 're all in this together and that we have to figure out a way to address these problems together and i could n't think of a better a better way to describe the situation as we look at it from the perspective of our country itself we 're all in this together , and somehow we have to find a way to solve this challenge together in their case they have a volunteer fire department and a volunteer ambulance , and they have a lot of trouble trying to sustain their ambulance services but because they felt that they were all in this together , everybody in the community helps out in talking to older people in particular , they expressed a concern about the costs of care in many parts of the country , they talk to us about the availability of care a lot of people expressed the hope that we can put far more emphasis on prevention but i think the uncertainty and the concern that people have , the anxiety they feel about being one illness away from bankruptcy came home over and over again so this conversation was a very helpful and a very productive one they had a lot of good ideas about the ways that we could go forward and a lot of hope that perhaps this time we can get it right and that working together we can begin to address their anxiety , solve this problem , and recognize that when it comes to health care we really are all in it together kennedy could you and i ask the clerk to watch the time very carefully could you talk a minute or two just about the urgency that you have seen in this whole whole battle in trying to bring about some reform of the health care system \? what what is your sense about about the urgency of this \? could you speak to that for a minute or two \? t daschle well , mr chairman , i 've concluded , and i 've had conversations with many of you , and i with all of you about this i i think that the cost of the status quo , the cost of doing nothing may be the most expensive option of all we have serious cost problems now , but every expert says that if we fail to address the issue of costs , that the situation will double just in the next 10 years alone the people that general motors \( nyse gm \) once told us they actually spend more on health care today than they do on steel the folks at starbucks \( nasdaq sbux \) told us that they spend more on health care than they do on coffee , and that the american family spends more on health care than they do on virtually any other thing but rent and so from a cost point of view alone , we know this situation will be dramatically exacerbated if we do nothing the same could be said for access we have huge problems with regard to the number of uninsured , but that s really the tip of the iceberg we have a number of people who are still underinsured that today we 're told statistically you have about a 5050 chance , if you 're insured , of getting the care that you need 5050 and that is only going to get worse , if we continue to fail to address this problem adequately and then , finally , the issue of quality continues to be a very pervasive and and corrosive one it troubles me that while we spent more than any other country , according to just about every evaluation that exists today , we come in somewhere in the 30s the most recent ranking in the world health organization was 37th in overall outcomes 37th 31st in life expectancy and 29th in infant mortality , 24th in overall women s health we do n't do very well , and so we 've got to figure a way to improve quality and i know that a lot of you have given a lot of thought that , and i hope we can work together to find ways to ensure that quality can be something every american can count on kennedy thank you very much now to senator enzi \? enzi thank you , mr chairman , and i 'll try and follow your lead in staying within the time limit that was very impressive i 'll start off with a question for senator daschle that i hope is just a oneword answer one reason we passed a considerable amount of legislation do this committee by unanimous consent is because of a good working relationship between the majority and the minority , both senators and the staff if confirmed , would you pledge to cooperate in this type of a working relationship with all senators on the committee , democrat or republican , and by promptly answering or responding to any written or phone inquiries , sharing information as soon as it becomes available , and director in your staff to do the same \? t daschle yes enzi thank you t daschle if i could just elaborate , i wanted to give you a oneword answer with no qualifications , but i just yes , for emphasis i really want to work in a collaborative way it s the only way are we going to get this done , and i want to be as responsive as i expected people to be when i asked those questions enzi thank you another reason that we 're able to get a lot of things done and this committee is that we do follow the legislative process , and i know you 're very familiar with that a part of the process , though , has been and one you 'd have a unique appreciation for is the use of the budget reconciliation and that sometimes undermines bipartisan support for legislation and so when we 're trying to create health care policy , you 've stated before that you 're not looking for a 51vote solution but rather a 70 , 80 or a 90vote solution i hope you believe that s the correct approach to enact health care reform and in the interest of building bipartisan support , will you discourage members from using the budget reconciliation process and hopefully even the stimulus package which will eliminate the ability to really get into the issues and make sure that the unintended consequences are covered and that sort of thing \? t daschle well i can give you a oneword answer on that , too , and that s yes , senator enzi i our goal , our hope and our desire , our determination is to use as you 've referred to it and as is properly referred , the regular order we think these committees have tremendous talent you have a physician and you have people that have worked these issues as many of you have for many , many years we need that input we need that involvement and that engagement and so i'm i'm determined to work with each of you and use the regular order to produce the best product we can enzi thank you i'm going to shift gears a little bit and talk about tobacco because the fda does approve cures not poisons and pending legislation from the last session would give fda authority over tobacco , a product that has no health benefits but significant risks and i'm concerned about a regulatory regime that would lend legitimacy to the tobacco industry do you think that it sends a poor public health message to have an implied fda seal of approval on an inherently unsafe product \? t daschle well , senator enzi , i believe that it s important for us to to discourage tobacco use in every way we can i believe that it s important for us to continue the extraordinary educational effort that has been underway now for decades i have had many conversations with people in the department of health and human services over my time in public life and have supported efforts over the years to discourage tobacco use and to find ways with which to especially discourage the use of tobacco among younger smokers i want to continue to find ways with which to do that i am inclined to believe that fda can play a very important role in that regard but i will promise you that i'm going to look at all of the options available to us as to what may be the most efficient , the most appropriate and prudent way with which to address the issue i in no way would endorse in an any case , allowing the fda to give its seal of approval i think the fda should , if it did anything , should regulate it in a way to provide the kind of discouraged efforts nationally and within the federal government that we have tried to build upon in public policy but i would certainly want to look and work with you to find the most appropriate way with which that can be done enzi thank you i think within the 80 percent rule there are some other options that we can do that will get the job done and i 'll yield the balance of my time kennedy thank you very much senator dodd \? dodd thank you very much , mr chairman and let me kennedy i 'll i understand that senator dole and senator johnson have other engagements we want to thank you very much for your presence dole i have one client i do n't want him to get away \( laughter \) enzi thank you , senator dole , by the way i was going to mention , bob , before you leave that they 're going back and one of the questions i was going to raise with tom is going back on the early childhood issues and i was thinking here reminding myself of a moment where you , george mitchell , senator kennedy in a room where the childcare development block grant never would 've happened but for bob dole or senator kennedy so thank you for that as well \( inaudible \) how about a round of applause for bob dole \? \( applause \) dodd well , mr chairman , let me just also join with our nominee and bob dole in saying what a pleasure it is to see you back here with us in the chair and this battle in front of us which our nominee has very , very aptly described is going to require remarkable leadership and there s never been a more remarkable leader than ted kennedy so we 're thrilled to have you here with us and going through these issues i have an opening statement i'm sure all of our other colleagues do and i 'd ask consent that that be included in the record if we could and , tom , welcome you 've described the situation well we 've got a health care system that s broken senator lamar alexander and i had some hearings last year on children i have a lot of hearings over the last 26 years in this committee dealing with children s issues but one statistic jumped out at us , came out of a study actually done out of tennessee in a children s hospital and we talk about economic conditions in the country and how we 're worried that our children or grandchildren may grow up that offers less opportunity economically for them i think we 're all aware of those statistics but what s stunning \( ph \) in senator alexander s report to me was that we may be looking at the first generation of americans who grow up less healthy than the previous generation that s never occurred in our nation s history before they 'll lead potentially less healthy lives , shorter lives with many more problems and you 've described some of them in your opening comments and so there are a lot of issues to grapple with but i 'd like to focus quickly if i could on these early childhood issues because it is part of the jurisdiction as well of the health and human services area head start , early head start , the childcare development block grant programs and the like , i noted that presidentelect obama has pledged some 10 billion in new spending on early childhood education through a zero to five plan and i'm excited about that and i commend him for that commitment to support to support for parents , young children administered through early learning challenge grants and better early learning efforts have historically been led by the department of health and human services it s not clear where this new program may operate and i just wonder if you might elaborate to the extent you can here this morning , where you think that s apt to go , how that 'll be managed \? will it be as i hope it will be , under the jurisdiction of health and human services \? do you have any idea maybe it s if it s not an unfair question for you at this point \? t daschle well , senator dodd , i think you said it so well i remember a highway sign outside of rapid city , south dakota , many , many years ago and all it said was it s so much better to build a child than to repair an adult and i 've always remembered that it s always better to build a child than to repair an adult and that s what you 've dedicated so much of your public life to doing i 've had many conversations with the presidentelect about this and he feels as strongly as you do about the importance of that priority organizationally , of course , we 're going to be looking at all of this in a very careful and thoughtful way and we 'd certainly appreciate the input of every member of this committee especially you with regard to how we do it right but we want to empower these agencies to have the ability to address these challenges we 're not doing as good a job as we should we do n't have the resources we do n't have the personnel and i do n't think we have the priority that it deserves i believe in the long term as you so correctly state with regard to health care that one of the biggest challenges we have is obesity in this country and one of the biggest opportunities we have to address obesity is with our children what a commentary it would be for us to acknowledge and then to accept that children would have a lower life expectancy than we would but currently , that is what we 're told that children have a lower life expectancy than we have in part because of obesity well i think we 've got to address that is to ensure that we have the infrastructure in place in the department of health and human services to work with the states and to work with communities and to make sure that we can make it the priority that it so rightfully deserves dodd well i thank you for that and i in fact , senator harkin s already had a good hearing in prevention we spent a lot of time talking about obesity in fact , jeff bingaman , myself , senator kennedy obviously , senator harkin doing a lot of work on the obesity issue and i was delighted to hear your comment you anticipated a question and so your statement obviously answers the question about the importance of this and that we give it that kind of emphasis i was stunned to hear your statistics about the diabetes level on the indian reservations , 50 percent of the adult population of course obesity in the correlation is important if i may as well , on the fda issue and you and i had a good conversation the other day and there are a number of these critical postcdc obviously and fda of getting someone in charge there right away one out of every four products americans consume is regulated by the food and drug administration twentyfive percent of everything we ingest our bodies is regulated by them and obviously having someone in place there that can give us the kind of direction that you 've mentioned in your opening statement i think is critically important and in that regard , just a quick question if i could to encourage you and ask you to comment on it , to promote this work dealing with the national institute of child health and human development at nih and fda who are doing the best they can with limited resources i might point out as well which i know you 're aware of that they have but i would strongly encourage us to promote this work and coordinate and prioritize and expand the work being done by these agencies and others with respect to pediatric therapeutics i would also be curious if any comments you might have on thoughts regarding strengthening fda s efforts to protect the unique needs of children with these orphan diseases again , it s a complicated area we 've spent a lot of time in this committee over the years dealing with those issues of encouraging development by the pharmaceutical industry for medicines and strengthening efforts including even in medical devices for children i do n't know if you have any thoughts or comments you 'd like to share with us on that point \? t daschle well i think you 're absolutely right and i 've had the opportunity to talk with others on the committee who share your concern about this and i first the first part of your question is can we move expeditiously and i can assure you that we are moving very expeditiously we hope to to build our team of leadership within hhs within the next few weeks we 've been doing aggressive interviewing and reviewing and soliciting good ideas and we 'd certainly be open to your suggestions about leadership in each one of these important departments secondly , i would say that it s very important senator burr and i had this conversation the other day about breaking down stovepipes so that the interrelationship between these agencies can do a better job of coordinating the effort fda has an important role but with regard to much of the research , so does nih and with regard to public health , so does cdc and what we have to do is to make sure that those stovepipes that prevent the kind of cooperative effort and a kind of integration can go forward , have to be torn down and so we 're going to make a real effort to coordinate , to integrate and to provide the kind of mission driven approach to this that will accommodate the goals that you so articulately outlined but i think you put your finger on a very important one and we 're going to be working with you to accomplish it dodd well i thank you very much and this is a challenging time and i want to commend the president he could n't have chosen a better person who can take challenges and handle them not only efficiently and well but with great courage and leadership and i ca n't wait to work with you over the coming several years to get this issue back on track again so congratulations to you t daschle thank you kennedy senator burr \? burr mr chairman welcome home because i think this is home for you on this committee and we 're glad to see you senator daschle , welcome and thank you for your willingness to once again serve in a capacity when asked let me talk about fda if i can for a minute for years the fda s been the gold standard of the approval process for drugs , biologics , devices and i think it s recognized that way around the world the fda s struggling today due to lack of funding , low morale , increasingly expanding mission i recently heard of a company that had pulled a decision to have their euapproved diabetes drug approved through the fda because once the fda designed the clinical trial process they would go through , they realized that it was more expensive than the value of the united states market for what was a revolutionary drug for diabetes that alarms me because the fda can function and the american people can lose share with me , if you will , how you think we overcome this in the future because i think we both agree that the innovation of drugs and biologics and devices are part of the key to our ability to control health care costs in the future but also to provide the quality that i think we all want to t daschle well you ask such a very , very good question , senator burr i think i would say that there are four components that will allow us the opportunity to do this right the first component is one that you all know extremely well in that you have to start with good public policy we have to know what the policy s going to be and the degree of clarity with regard to what that policy is is critical the second is you have to have the resources and you alluded to the fact that we 've had struggles with resources in fda and elsewhere and i think we have to address the resource question and we 'd certainly want to work with you with regard to resources t daschle i think the third is leadership i think we have to show real leadership with regard to priorities and with regard to the kind of motivation of the workforce to do all we can to maximize our opportunities once we 've set the policy and found the resources we need the leadership to make sure this is going to work right and i hope we can provide good leadership and partly it goes to senator dodd s question of who it is we 're going to find to to head up fda but all through the department of health and human services , we have to have good leadership and then , finally , it seems to me , we have to be able to to coordinate better i i worry that there s not enough coordination i worry that the nih does n't talk to the fda , does n't talk to the cdc , does n't talk to cms , and i as much as they should and i think we can , if we 're sensitive to that and if we know that that problem exists , i think we 've got to find ways to to tear down the stovepipes that you and i talked about the other day but it seems to me if we did that , if we had those four components in place , that we could really make a difference there and i hope to work with you to make that happen burr well , i thank you for that senator , the ryan white care act is up for reauthorization i'm curious do you agree with me that the funding should follow those that are infected with hiv \? t daschle well , i agree with you that the ryan white act is first of all , i commend the people of this committee on a bipartisan basis for showing the support and for the effort that they 've made over the years and while i think there are differences with regard to how the overall funding ought to be calculated , i generally believe that that direction in funding is appropriate and ought to be respected burr i thank you for that senator , i do n't want to put you on the spot , but you mentioned south dakota and the rural nature north carolina is very much the same , and i think the rural states are unique and require certain additions to our thought process for the same level of care to be delivered or the same lever of coverage to be delivered medicare advantage was created to try to provide options in rural markets , or the way it was designed was with the rural markets in mind now , the presidentelect has proposed changes to medicare advantage , and i would only ask you if you have any comments relative to how , if you structurally change medicare advantage , it would affect south dakotans' ability to have choices for coverage , specifically those seniors under medicare t daschle well , senator burr , as as you know , in most rural areas we have huge problems relating to access in particular we have a wonderful infrastructure in place that that has come about in part because of the support of this committee in community health centers and i 've had the chance to talk with some of you about the rural community health centers in rural america in particular , and i ca n't tell you how strongly i feel about their import we have a real problem , of course , with the ihs and the lack of adequate funding for facilities on indian reservations , so we have a serious problem there with regard to access that has to be addressed both access and quality in part , because of resources i do think that as we look at medicare advantage , it has provided some support for people in in rural areas , and , and to the extent that it has , it s it s been welcome i think it s become a much more expensive option , unfortunately 13 percent more expensive and i think we have to look at whether or not we 're getting our money s worth and the presidentelect has said that he thinks it s important for us to look at the at the inefficiencies and the problems associated with spending in medicare advantage and address them but it is the law part c is part of the medicare program and i would hope that we could look at medicare advantage at medicare and medicaid in the larger context of health reform and find ways of which all these problems can be made to work better and i look forward to working with you on that on that goal in particular burr thank you thank you , mr chairman kennedy mr harkin \? harkin thank you very much , mr chairman and i again , great to see you back as our chair , and it s great to have you back , ted and our colleague , tom daschle , again my congratulations , i think , on your taking this over it s going to be a lot of hard work you have , but there s some really great things i think that we that we can accomplish first of all , let me just thank you so much for your testimony , which i read last night , and and the many times that you referred to prevention , and the fact that we need to make it sort of the central part and you mentioned that in your book also more more than once and you mentioned it in your in your verbal testimony today senator murkowski just asked me what i meant about prevention , and i 'd like to interchange prevention and wellness it s not just preventing illness , it s it s enabling people to stay well as dr andrew weil once said , you know the body really wants to be healthy we are engineered over the millennia that our dna wants us to be healthy that s the normal state of being of the body , yet we interfere with that too many times by what we eat and what we smoke and what we drink and we do n't exercise and all other kinds of things and so how do we build the system to change it so that we really promote wellness and incentivize it \? all the incentives are now in our system , as you know , tom , is on patching , fixing , mending , as you have said both here today and in your and in your book but in this area of prevention , much of it is not we think of as being under the health umbrella i think of schoolbased programs , what our kids eat in school we have the child nutrition bill up again this year workplace wellness , communitybased wellness programs , and also one other part , and that that is mental health again , you you focused on that also so many times we have found that many of our physical ailments have have their genesis in in stress , depression , other forms of mental mental illnesses so i guess my question is , in thinking of all this , how are you kind of focusing on on integrating all this \? i mean you 're going to be the head of health care reform , but a lot of this is not just under that health care umbrella it goes out of transportation it goes into schools and workplaces and tax policies and things like that if you could , just give me some idea of how you see this your head of this coordinating and pulling this all together so it s not just in health and human services it s in , as i say , department of transportation , department of education , department of agriculture all of these different things impact us on whether we 're going to be healthy or not i just some idea of how you 'd pull all this together t daschle well , senator harkin , i i you you said it very , very well i i think we need to change the paradigm in this country on health it starts with that big picture belief that the paradigm needs to be changed from from illness to wellness and if we understand the shift in paradigm and the recognition that it s no longer an illness driven system , it s a wellness driven system , it opens it starts to open up the series of considerations that you suggest have to be made that fall way outside the purview of health and human services i look at health care as a pyramid in every country , who are at the base of the pyramid you have primary care , and you work your way up until you get more and more sophisticated , until at the very top you have heart transplants and mris every country starts at the base of the pyramid with primary care , and they work their way up until the money runs out we start at the top of the pyramid , and we work our way down until the money runs out and the money runs out and so few people get good primary care and wellness and so we have to change the pyramid we have to start at the base and if we 're going to do that , it has to be pervasive it has to be part of the goal of the department of education , the department of defense it has to be the goal of the department of commerce it has to be the goal , in other words , of everyone so that we can market the idea of wellness and i think in part it s it s partly it s the marketing we 've got to be you know wellness has to be cool , and prevention has to be a hot thing and we 've got to make prevention hot and wellness cool and and i think that it s really important for us to build that perception of of prevention and wellness in a way that actually is part of all aspects of our lives , our workplace , our school , our our buildings , and and find ways of which to make wellness easier and so much of it has to do with nutrition and no one has spent more as chairman of the agriculture committee , no one has spent more time on nutrition then you have but it s got to be nutrition we are n't going to address obesity and prevention and wellness unless we make better school lunches , unless we take the junk food out of schools , and unless we put physical exercise back into the school curriculum those kinds of things could go a long way to helping us create this new wellness paradigm that we need so badly harkin wow keep giving that speech , will you , tom \? thank you very much thank you , mr chairman kennedy senator , thank you senator coburn \? coburn thank you and as with others , welcome back it s good to see you looking so well i ca n't wait till that thundering voice comes after me on the senate floor i 'll appreciate you being there and , senator daschle , thank you i very much enjoyed our conversation yesterday appreciate it one of the laws that the presidentelect obama passed was the accountability and transparency law and it is a law , and it s a mandatory requirement , that we have a lot of those that agencies do n't comply with , like improper payments , et cetera but in my discussions with him , he he s very insistent , and i just wanted to get a commitment out of you for the agencies that you worked under or that work under you , that you will be in compliance to make sure that every agency under your authority will in fact monthly submit the data so the american people can see where we 're spending our money and what we 're doing , both down to the subcontrantee and the subgrantee t daschle senator coburn , i could n't agree more with you and i have had conversations with the presidentelect about it i know that s important to him , as it is to you , and i would do all i can and i need your your help if i'm not doing it , i need you to let me know how i can do better coburn i 'll remind you t daschle good \( laughter \) coburn i just wanted to comment on and you and i had discussions and yesterday one of the reasons prevention does n't happen in this country is because we do n't pay for it we were in fact , in medicare and medicaid we refuse to pay for it we refuse to pay for prevention and so i'm excited that the only way our last medicare trustee report showed just on medicare alone the infinity cost , unfunded liability , was 85 trillion and the only way we 're going to bring that number down is through prevention , preventing chronic disease instead of just retreating it and your your pyramid is a very good explanation of where we where we stand on that i would for your perusal , an editorial today in the wall street journal about medicaid , because i know we 're going to be talking in the stimulus package about putting medicaid dollars in it it was by a former member of an hhs team , scott gottlieb , talking about the quality that s available on medicaid and i 'd love to see your comments on it , because i think there are some significant things i also in the time left just want to join with my colleague , senator burr from north carolina we 're both highly interested in ryan white , and last year we made significant changes to where the money is following the epidemic , where african women africanamerican women , who had been discriminated against by formulas it is vastly important that those dollars goal where the disease is , if we 're ever to get a true handle on it and i was glad to hear your response and i know that s controversial because of some of the programs , but if we 're not going to follow the epidemic , then we 're going to we 're going to have another problem later on is going to get further out of our control one of the other commitments that presidentelect obama made in his campaign and he and i have talked this is topdown review in every agency across the federal government about what s effective , but has metrics on it , what does n't , how do we get rid of the wasteful and duplicate programs and i guess my question is , number one , are you committed to do that \? number two , when do you expect to have that finished , because an hhs there s a ton of inefficiency \? we all know that it s not talking about the workers the workers there are great , but the we designed the programs , and we 've created the inefficiency when would you expect to have that completed \? and would you give us a copy of that so that we can see it as well , because unless we can legislate on it , we 're not going to be able to make any impacts for you \? t daschle well , senator coburn , i believe that a topdown review is essential i 'd start with that i think it s very , very important to understand what the problems are before we tried to make the system better i also think that if all of us want to encourage the use of best practices and and good compared to research , we ought to start with the institutions themselves and try to apply best practices approaches and management decisions with regard to each one of the departments within hhs and so i will be very vigorous with regard to the topdown review and , frankly , would want to do it as expeditiously as possible i'm not familiar with the length of time matters like this would normally take , but i will keep you apprised of our progress and , by all means , would be more than happy to share it with you and members of the committee i think you should have it , because i think , most likely , if there are issues that are going to have to be addressed , many of them may be issues that involve statute and so we 'd love to work with you on that , but i will certainly keep you apprised of your progress as we go forward \( unknown \) mr chairman , are we going to have a second round \? kennedy yes \( unknown \) ok , thank you thank you i yield back kennedy thank you very much senator mikulski \? mikulski senator kennedy , we truly are so glad to see you back and that robust voice and the verve and the vigor and i just want to let you know that senator enzi was so kind in his comments about the higher ed act but i want you to know , senator enzi really helped me be able to work on a bipartisan basis to be able to do that , and senator burr was particularly helpful in the minority historically black colleges so we really did work very , very well together and i want to thank all of our colleagues to do that senator daschle , it s really with great enthusiasm that we see you i remember that we once talked about a colleague who had a bit of a swagger and you said he was all hat and no cattle when i looked at the 67 , 000 federal employees you have , you have a lot of cattle and now we 've got to get you a hat , as secretary of hhs but i think all of our colleagues know that you bring great intellect and grasp for public policy , a real commitment to the issues and in working with you as our democratic leader , i think one of the signatures of your style is collegiality and consultation and i know that that s going to be a hallmark of how you will work and i believe that s how we 'll be able to deliver for the american people let me go right to my questions and talk about those 67 , 000 employees , many of whom reside in the state of maryland , and they work at agencies like nih , 13 , 000 , from firefighters to protect the public safety of our employees and their research to the nobel prize winners would be there , to fda , over 4 , 000 people , to cms , which is there and i can tell you right now they want to work and they want to work for change but what they 're so frustrated about is the type of leadership that they have not gotten and that goes to the questions that a question that i have for you i see the direction as three rs one , to reinvigorate our civil service , to reform the way we do business and for them to have the resources they need to do the job let s go to fda , which we feel , many of us , was one of the most politicized agencies in the federal government senator murray and i worked on many women s health issues we had things like dr seuss in wood \( ph \) being pushed out we had the office of women s health that i helped create with senator olympia snowe , where we had to fight to not only keep it , but when we cut it , they put a guy who was a veterinarian in charge of it we had one battle after another , from micro to macro , in the safety of our drugs so when you look at these agencies , and often we blame the so called bureaucrats , but i think we have to look at the political leadership that was there and the kind of leadership that they can now expect how do you see reinvigorating and reforming the sciencebased agencies \? t daschle senator mikulski , i 've had some real good conversations with people within the department and with others with regard to that very problem the first and most important thing is something i said in my statement , which is that i want to reinstate a sciencedriven environment i want to take ideology and politics as much as humanly possible out of the process and leave the scientists to do their job and i think it s very important for us to allow scientists to be scientists and to give them the resources to do it right and so it starts with that it starts with the importance of giving them the autonomy they need , without fear of conflict at some point with others along the decisionmaking process regarding factors having nothing to do with science and so i think it starts by empowering our scientists to do the great work that we know they can do mikulski do you also see establishing now , let s go to drug safety and drug efficacy one is the safety issue and my question is have you had a chance to develop a framework on whether you want an independent board to ensure that , how we assure safety \? but then it goes to efficacy now , one of the things in fda approval is is the drug effective now , but one of the questions is is the drug that s being proposed more effective than what might be cheaper and already available on the market have you had the chance to look at that or will you wait for your new fda commissioner to advise you on this \? t daschle well , we 've begun to look at it , but i do believe that this decisionmaking process has to be very thoughtful , has to be very collaborative , and certainly should involve our leadership within fda , in particular , but , also , members of this body , this panel , in particular , as well i think that it s important we come to grips with it and to put an infrastructure in place and i would certainly love your input and your guidance as we do that but i want to wait until we have the leadership in place before we make any final decisions mikulski well , i'm sure that the transition team is moving very , very much on it i 'd like to go to prevention and quality i chair a working group on quality the reason i asked about prevention , it s the most often used phrase and the least understood one , usually prevention means more testing and we support that you were a leader in helping us get mammograms for women in your role here and we appreciate that but the other issue is , also , what doctors will say is diet and exercise and then where does that happen and how does that happen and how do we ensure compliance \? my definition of prevention , particularly in the management of chronic disease , is if you have it , it does n't get worse so let s take diabetes you go from insulinresistant to perhaps being insulindependent , but you want to avoid the macro excuse me the micro vascular consequences , eye deterioration , vascular deterioration , kidney deterioration that comes from good medicine , good medical practice , and diet and exercise most doctors will give you a sheet of paper that says here s the diet and you need to do more exercise then people are on their own and i wonder , one , how so let me get to the question one , how do you see health insurance reform \? if we 're going to have medical homes , we 'll move towards compliance and , also , move to a broader definition for example , for we who work about seniors , much has been said about , gee , we have the whole older americans act we have senior centers in every community , which could be tools particularly for a particular population to prevent the further escalation of their chronic condition and i wonder if that s what you mean by breaking down the stovepipes and then , also , this whole idea , if we get health insurance reform , how are we going to have compliance with medical recommendations t daschle well , there s mikulski and maybe that s a whole other hearing t daschle i do think that it is subject to a lot more discussion than we probably have time for this morning , but i think you put your finger on a very two very important factors here one is defining our issues as clearly as we can i think before we can ever get to the solutions of health care , we have to make sure that we 're all on the same page with regard to the problems of health care and i would hope that we could be of like mind with regard to at least the ideas that many of have already begun to share on those problems we have cost problems we have access problems but as you rightfully point out in your question , we certainly have quality problems and if those are the categories of problems , cost , access and quality , how is it that we can build a high value , high performance system \? well , it seems to me the only way to do it is to improve access , improve quality and reduce cost but how do we do that \? and that gets to your question , your second part of your question that takes a framework and i think we should talk a lot more about how we ought to ensure a proper framework i have very strong ideas about it , but i also know that this has to be collaborative i think there has to be a realization that unless we have a framework , we can talk about policy , but ultimately , the implementation of that policy will never come to fruition we have to have a better integration , more efficiency , far more transparency and the only way that s going to come is if we can put a framework in place to ensure that the system is administered a whole lot better than it is today now , it is administered in small pieces all over with very little integration senator coburn and i talked last night about interoperability and that s just one example we do n't have an interoperable system yet and you can argue about how long it 'll take to get there , but it just seems to me it ought to be an embarrassment for this country , in this day and age , that we still do n't have an operable system when it comes to health information and technology and that goes to your point we need to find a way to make that happen and i want to work with you to ensure that we make that as high a priority as it deserves to be mikulski thank you , mr chairman kennedy thank you very much we have historically followed the leadership role on this committee so we take advantage of the and have followed that in the past just so that we let our colleagues know , which would , in our side , have senator murkowski next and then senator hatch , in that order , and we 'll follow that order on this committee , as well murkowski i had to consult with my colleague here i appreciate that , mr chairman and , senator daschle , welcome i appreciate the time that you gave me the other evening as we discussed issues as it relates to health care and some of the most vulnerable in our society we talked about the situations with american indians , alaskan natives , and their health care status so , again , i appreciate the time i appreciate your willingness to serve in this capacity one of the issues that comes to me as i go back home to alaskans is the issue of access and both of us coming from rural states , where we do n't have the number of health care providers that i think we would like to have for our constituents , we share the same concerns but what we 're seeing in my state of alaska with medicare eligible individuals and their ability to see a doctor , in the largest city in the state of alaska , to know that there were no doctors that were willing to take on new medicare patients , really , all of a sudden , it became not just somebody else s problem , but it was a problem for people everywhere throughout the state and we have been working to deal with that in just kind of little bits and pieces , but nothing that is really making that difference and i have constituents who are coming to me and saying , lisa , we would rather forego the medicare benefits that we have paid into for years and instead purchase private coverage just so that i can get into see a doctor i just need to be able to see a doctor what are we going to do about a medicare system that is failing our seniors in many areas when they ca n't get in to see anyone \? what is it that we can do \? i know that there are some suggestions out there that would broaden the scope of the medicare coverage , including individuals between 55 and 64 do you believe that medicare is sustainable enough to bring more enrollees into the program \? speak to me a little bit about medicare and specifically what it means to those of us in rural states , where we just have such a shortage , incredible shortage of providers t daschle well , senator murkowski , you 've spoken with a real passion about it and i can understand that passion because anybody from the west can identify completely with your very apt description of our circumstances i think access is a function of many different factors and , obviously , as you rightfully suggest , medicare is a big part of and a very pervasive part of this situation we almost understate the problem of access if all we do is limit it to the number of uninsured , because we have a real access problem when it comes to mental health in this country there are so few mental health providers in south dakota t daschle mental health is oftentimes overlooked in so many ways , in part because it s not been given the priority it deserves and thanks to extraordinary efforts by the chairman and members of this committee , we 're beginning to build the kind of parity with regard to mental health that s so critical but access to mental health care in rural areas is almost nonexistent in some cases access to dental care is a real problem and so it s a function of medicare in part but i think it s a far more universal challenge and i i think there are four things that i would suggest we consider to begin to start addressing this issue one is to encourage in as many ways as possible more primary care providers i 'd like to go back to the national health service corps to see what we can do to encourage larger numbers of national health service corps providers murkowski we can start by funding that t daschle funding murkowski yes t daschle funding is a is a good way to start and the resources in that regard would be very helpful encouraging students as we change this paradigm from illness to wellness and encouraging students to come back into primary care and good and and and to be willing to be the kind of family practitioners that ought to be the anchor , the basis upon which our health care system is built is a second thing i think we ought to use our alternative providers and i do n't really like that term but our the the providers , the nurses , the nurse practitioners , the physicians assistants , far more effectively pharmacists can play a far more important role than they do that , to me , is a very important part and then , as we talk , i think we can do a lot more with hit , especially in rural areas we need to encourage better broadband access and far more utilization of services provided through hit but all through this , medicare could be murkowski ought to be t daschle the beneficiary of that effort and i hope we can make that happen murkowski thank you , mr chairman i have i have pages and hours more questions but i will defer until next round kennedy senator murray \? murray thank you , mr chairman and it is wonderful to see you back as well t daschle thank you murray and i am delighted that you 're going to be leading us as we head into a very important health care discussion and hopefully move legislation this year it s great to see you here t daschle thank you very much murray senator daschle , welcome and i am delighted that you are taking on this agency congratulations on the nomination on this i look forward to working with you your passion has been shown to this committee we know from many , many years this has been these are the issues that really drive you personally and i'm delighted you 're going to be at the realm as we really take on some incredible challenges over the coming years on health care and all the other issues that you will be facing you 've heard a lot of people talk to you about access you talked about it in your opening statement you talked about the lack of providers , particularly primary care physicians i 've been holding a number of hearings in my state to talk about the lack of health care providers that are out there and there is a direct correlation with cost if there is n't a doctor to go to or nurses available , it drives up the cost of health care and it is n't just doctors it s nurses and all the vast array of health care providers when you go back to young people in high school who are going to hopefully go into these professions , very few of them know about these professions or begin to prepare in a right way to go into those fields so i wanted to ask you , as we look at health care reform in whatever form it comes to us , is there a way to incorporate going out and bringing more people into the health care professions , showing them the paths that they need to get into it , and making sure that we focus on making sure we have enough providers in the vast array of health care that s out there t daschle well , senator murray , i think you ask a very , very important question and i think it starts with sort of a realization that our system works through incentives right now , there s a great deal of incentive to become a subspecialist the the reimbursement system as a as an incentive is one that clearly incentivizes subspecialties i 'd like to see the day when we incentivize in the same way our primary care providers , our nurses i 'd like to see incentivization of a wellness system all the way through , from providers through institutions , our clinics i i i think that , in part , is is how this is going to happen , is the incentivization that that will have to occur and and there s no better opportunity for us to do it than with health reform but it ca n't just be that i think we also have to encourage that the providers themselves be incentivized and that seems to me to to suggest that we we put more emphasis on scholarships for primary care providers more emphasis on forgiveness of college costs for primary care providers finding ways to say look , if you take this route , we 're going to be with you we 're going to be a partner with you we 're going to try to find ways to ensure that you have you have the financial wherewithal to become that frontline physician or that frontline provider that we need and so we need to send that message and it seems to me payment reform and tuition assistance are two powerful tools to do it and to incentivize in a way that could make this system begin to turn around murray well , i i really look forward to working with you on that i obviously heard a lot about primary care physicians but it was everything from therapists to somebody to read the mammogram t daschle exactly murray and we have got to incentivize those and create this we 're looking to create jobs we have got to really focus on that and i think you 've outlined some great ways to do that so i look forward to being a partner with that one of the other issues that affects costs is and i know senator murkowski shares this view is the way we reimburse physicians today under medicare with the sustainable growth rate is is an outdated system that basically incentivizes people using patient patient utilization rather than looking at healthy outcomes for reimbursement this is an issue i know you and i have talked about when you were a leader and frustrated with it , because it was impacting a lot of physicians in our state who were no longer seeing medicare patients because of the reimbursement trying to make it more fair trying to focus on healthy outcomes is is this something that you 're going to be focusing on as well \? t daschle well , i i could n't feel more strongly that the sgr system is n't is just is n't working right we 're we 're in the middle of it right now , as you know we have to come up with a with some sort of a an answer to the expiration of the current authorization this year and i can recall being in your shoes on countless occasions and saying i do n't really have a clue what the sgr should be i'm going to listen to the experts and i'm certainly going to pay attention to my staff but at the end of the day , i do n't know that it makes a whole lot of sense for you to be put in that position over and over and over again it s as hot a political position as you 're ever going to get and even after you get beyond the politics and the pressures , you still have to worry , do i have do i have the wherewithal to make these decisions on a routine basis \? we need to come up with a better system administration and i'm hopeful that we can do that as we look at health reform murray and i hope we look at it , not as reimbursing based on utilization , but rather based on healthy outcomes t daschle absolutely healthy outcomes , and i do n't think we ought to base it on a procedurebyprocedure approach i think it ought to be episodic i 'd like to see us look at sort of the larger issue and encourage , as you say , better outcomes and i do n't i'm not i'm not one who supports this socalled performancebased approach but i do believe that there are episodic ways with which to look at reimbursement that give us a lot more latitude to incent again , if i can use that term , better outcomes and lower cost and far less hassle for providers murray very good and my time is up but thank you very much i look forward to working with you t daschle thank you kennedy senator hatch hatch well , thank you , mr chairman glad to see you there and look forward to working with you in this coming months and years senator daschle , it s great to have you back nice to have you here and i'm i'm particularly appreciative of linda for allowing you to do this gutbusting job , because it s going to be a tough job but it s really important and i think you can do it well and i intend to support you but there are a lot of areas where i think there s consensus , for instance , your ideas on nationwide health information technology infrastructure and giving every american an electronic you know , electronic health record your emphasis on preventive care i think that s important and of course , the national problem of childhood obesity as well as adult obesity as well increased access to health care for rural areas , certainly underserved areas , mainly through community health centers this committee is a very strong committee with regard to implementing and helping community health centers , because i think they do a terrific job at a reasonable cost compared to so many other things and of course , you 've indicated a desire to try and resolve some of the medical liability problems as well , because we know that s driving an awful lot of the costs anybody who s ever worked in that area , and i have , understands that so these are all very , very important things but if i could just mention a couple of things , members of this committee have become increasingly concerned about the issue of antimicrobial resistance and a number of bills were introduced during the 110th congress , including a bill by senator brown and myself entitled strategies to address antimicrobial resistance or what we call the star act now , i am interested in hearing your thoughts about this this basic topic , because in the star act , senator brown and i have suggested a rather holistic approach to the problem of antibiotic resistance and establish we would establish a network of experts across the country to conduct regional monitoring of resistant organisms as they occur , sort of like a snapshot to pick up on problems early would you agree that it is important that we augment cdc s current surveillance system with some sort of expert system as well \? t daschle well senator hatch , i i first of all want to commend you and senator brown for your outstanding work here this is not an area for which there is a great deal of of of history and prior attention so the fact that you have dedicated your time and effort to ensuring that we we begin to put a policy in place is one that is recognized and appreciated and i share your view that this is something that that that really does deserve a framework , a national framework , within which we can we can begin to put the kind of attention and priority that it that it deserves i do n't have any particular definitive solution today but i 'd really be very interested in working with you and accommodating your larger goals in accomplishing this in the nottoo distant future there s a tremendous need for greater thought , greater work , greater research and i 'd like to work in partnership with you to make that happen hatch well , thank you in 1984 , congress passed the drug price competition and patent term restoration act i know a little bit about that , by the way and i 've maintained my strong support of the generic drug industry over the years , because it helped to create i think at that time , we were lucky to have 18 percent of the industry in the form of generic drugs today it s twothirds so it has helped bring down costs an average of 10 billion a year every year since 1984 , and more today but let me just say this since twothirds of today s prescriptions at least that s the estimate are generic i think this is a good measure indicating that the law has abundant benefits for american consumers and the law guarantees patients that these drug copies are safe and effective it guarantees generic manufacturers that their applications will be reviewed within 180 days and it guarantees innovators that scientific experts determine the products are bioequivalent unfortunately , questions have been raised about whether each of these is true and this is something i think you 've got to get into and a big part of the problem seems to be that the office of generic drugs has become the poor stepsister to the office of new drugs , which receives a guaranteed funding stream through user fees and appropriations now as a result , the office of generic drugs has suffered from inadequate findings , an erosion of their scientific base and declining morale due to funding constraints as well as disruptions caused by the nowstalled move to white oak , which is very important to me as well by the agency s own admission last year , quote , it is still difficult to keep pace both with incoming applications and with other matters requiring ogd resources , such as citizen petitions , lawsuits challenging the approval of generic drugs and providing a guidance to the industry , unquote so i'm concerned that we may have a system here that is broken and i would like you to really take some time , when you get there , to look that over and see what you can do because this is a really , really important area of health care that i think you 'll take a great deal of joy in helping to maintain and make even better my time s up and i appreciate you allowing me this little extra time , mr chairman but i intend to support you i think you 'll make a great secretary of health and human services and and i intend to support you after you 're there as well so , just stay close and i hope that i can be of help to you t daschle well , thank you very much , senator hatch if i could just respond , because i think your your point about generic drugs is so important as we look to ways with which to bring down costs , i am i am absolutely convinced that a big part of of of that effort , if it s going to be done successfully , will be determined by the degree to which generic drugs are allowed to play the role that it can and so the office of generic drugs needs to be supported and financed , needs to be given the kind of priority and and empowerment that it deserves and i would really like to work very closely with you to ensure that a mutual goal that we would have with regard to generic drugs is is realized so thank you for your support and your your especially for your leadership on that issue hatch thank you so much kennedy very good thank you very much senator reed \? reed welcome , mr chairman , and it s great to see you there with your chairmanship and with this cabinet position , we are on the road to health care reform , i believe it s a long road , but this is encouraging first , please let me say that the president has made a very wise choice , and i personally again want to thank you for your help and friendship , when i was particularly a new member here in this body i was very encouraged when you spoke to senator murray about the emphasis on primary care and the development of primary care physicians one of the components of health care reform has to be to significantly increase our base of primary care physicians and nurses , et cetera title vii , as you 're aware , of the the relevant act provides for resources to help do this , but it s just chronically underfunded as you grapple with health care reform , you 're also grappling with the budget , so good luck on both matters but if you could pay particular attention to title vii , that would be very appreciative in a similar vein , section 317 of cdc s program on immunization is so important it s been estimated that we need to provide these about 11 billion to cover all the recommended vaccines for eligible children and adults and frankly , we provided less than half of that so that i think is another priority and the estimates are staggering in terms of the savings for every dollar we spend here , we collectively save 1650 it s one of those in fact , it s one of the great crimes \( ph \) to public health over the last hundred years vaccination so if you 'd like to comment , i would appreciate it , senator t daschle well , i think this is a first time immunization has come up in the hearing , and i applaud you , senator reed , for raising it immunization is probably as as sound an investment as we can make in good health i ca n't imagine that we could do any better than ensure that every every child is immunized , and that we understand the importance of of broadbased immunization and the tremendous good health that can come from it but but i think at at various times in the past , while we 've certainly been supportive rhetorically , we have n't been supportive through research and i think it s critical , as you know , that we put the resources where they belong , in the best investments in health , and certainly immunization is one of them reed oh , thank you , senator you , in response to senator kennedy , talked about your listening tour across the country and you know here often it comes down to 317 and 12 billion and x and y and z but for people across the country it s much more personal i wonder if you have an anecdote you 'd like to share which for you encapsulate sort of the the situation in the country and and the most sort of impressive comment that you heard out there on the trail t daschle well , i heard just extraordinary stories about about people who understood the economic circumstances that they had were so directly related to the health circumstances they were facing the stories of personal bankruptcy are the ones that come back to me so frequently , the stories of people who were hardworking people , hardworking and cared so deeply for their country and their families , who are virtually thrown out on the street because they could n't cope with the extraordinary expense of staying well and i must say , as a society , as a country , how in the world can we allow in the year 2009 for us to say you know that s just the way life is \? how can we possibly say to those people there s there s not a better way \? so it seems to me it s those those extraordinary , gripping stories of of personal personal collapse as a result of the fact that we have not come up with a health care system that allows people to get sick in many cases without total economic destruction those are the ones that have had such an incredible impact on me , and they 'll be the ones i 'll remember as we go through this year reed again , thank you , mr leader , and and i look forward to your leadership in the in the department of health and human services thank you t daschle thank you very much , senator reed kennedy and thank you , dr reed i do n't think i 've heard i had to heard an explanation as clear and as passionate as we heard from jack reed on the the general need , the overall need about health care reform so i thank him very much for his statement and tom daschle s response on it was i thought enormously moving and really very helpful to our our committee senator sanders \? sanders thank you , senator kennedy , and and welcome back we need your leadership at this moment tom , it s great to see you here i look forward to working with you when you are the secretary when you go last in a long line of questions , it s it s hard to come up with anything brilliant or new , but i 'll try \( laughter \) last year , legislation was introduced which had 12 cosponsors , including senator kennedy , senator harkin , senator clinton , and i suspect senator murkowski mikulski , which essentially would deal with an issue you heard a lot about today and that is take a program that senator kennedy developed some 40 years ago , which has widespread bipartisan support you heard senator hatch talk about it , senator byrd talk about it , president clinton president bush has been very supportive and that is the federally qualified health center program and what that legislation would do also supported by barack obama , who used to sit right here , first cosponsor it would go from 2 billion a year that we 're currently spending 1 , 100 community health centers to 44 community 4 , 400 community health centers , essentially providing quality health care , dental care , low cost prescription drugs , mental health counseling to every american in an underserved area you go from 2 billion to 8 billion , you expand the national health service corps , and you know what happens \? you save money all of the studies indicate that by allowing people to come to a doctor rather than going to the emergency room or going to the hospital , you save money here s my question will you be supportive of the concept of significantly expanding the community health centers with bipartisan support so that every american has access to a doctor or a dentist \? t daschle well , senator sanders , you you speak so passionately about this , and i i share your passion , if not your eloquence and i i strongly support the goal and will work very , very closely with you to see how closely we can come i 'd like to see if we could even surpass that goal but i'm with you and would be very , very excited about the prospect of a partnership that would allow us to accomplish it while i'm there sanders would you agree that that spending that money that amount of money so that we quadruple the number of community health centers would actually save medicare money , medicaid money and their health care system money , that it is \? t daschle no question no question sanders ok so can we count on your support in that area \? we are trying to get some money in the stimulus package to help community health centers is that something you can be supportive of \? t daschle i ca n't speak to the stimulus package , because it is n't completed yet , but i'm certainly supportive of putting it in every economic vehicle we have i think there is economic stimulus to be had there , and while i will be enthusiastically supportive of the package , whether it s in stimulus or something else , the sooner we can get it done , the better sanders all right i was glad to hear you mention the crisis and dental care as well , because sometimes when i talk about health care , we forget the reality that millions and millions of americans , especially rural areas , ca n't find a dentist let me bring back the issue i think jack reed raised it as well , and others the need to substantially increase funding for the national health service corps so that we can get dentists and doctors into medically underserved areas is that something you would be supportive of \? t daschle i think senator murkowski and i talked a little bit about that as well but you 're absolutely right i we have been the beneficiaries in south dakota of the national health service corps on the reservations in particular , but also off the reservations and i i think it s a tremendous investment we need to to provide the kind of funding and to encourage the the participation in national health service corps that we 've seen at times in the past and i 'd love to work with you to make that happen sanders thank you and you mentioned dental care we will work aggressively to increase the number of dentists in this country we probably need more dental schools , but we have a graying of the dental profession we need to encourage more young people to get in there is that something you would be willing to work on \? t daschle absolutely we need to do that we need that in particular in rural areas we are having a real hard time with dentists , as we are , as i said earlier , with mental health care providers in rural areas but i that has to be a priority sanders let me quickly change gear , move out of health care to crisis that we do n't talk enough about about enough here and that is we have 18 percent of our children living in poverty , which , as you may know , is the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world at the same time , we have more people in jail than any other country in the world , including china we spend 50 , 000 a year to put people in jail , and yet millions of working families do not have access to quality childcare or preschool education would you make the needs of our kids and significantly improving the disastrous child care situation in america one of your priorities \? t daschle absolutely as as i said earlier to another question , i i believe in in that slogan that it s so much easier to build a child than to repair an adult and i think we ought to get about building children , building the next leadership in this country and i 'd love to work with you to make that happen sanders thank you very much mr chairman , thank you kennedy thank all of you very much i 'd like if there are other members who are other members would like to make a ask a question , we 'd welcome their participation now \( unknown \) mr chairman , there are a lot of additional questions , so i 'd ask if it would be possible to submit them and get a prompt response before the committee makes its decision \? kennedy submit them and have them apart of the record \( unknown \) we do appreciate the answers that we 've gotten today and look forward to the the same cooperative spirit and look forward to a quick confirmation so that we can get senator daschle in place doing the job that we need done kennedy thank you senator enzi , if you 'd just withhold , we 're going to hear a few a few of our colleagues here who have asked for a few more minutes to be able to complete their their thoughts dodd well , mr chairman , i do n't have any any additional questions they 're a lot more questions , obviously , but i think as as tom pointed out , we could literally have hearings on almost every question that s been raised this morning they are all deeply significant and important , the magnitude of the problem it also speaks in a way , so it s how we get to think about reorganizing ourselves appear , something we 're not likely to do in the short term but but there s so many areas of overlapping jurisdiction and dealing with the stovepipe analysis as you brought up i think you talked about senator burr talking about our ability to get our arms around all of this , given the bifurcated structure we deal with appear , make that very difficult it s not a problem , obviously , you 're going to be able to address there was a time maybe we might have , a different role you played i just want to make two points that i thought were very important that you raised today there were a lot of things you said that were tremendously helpful i think in giving a sense of your appreciation of the problem one is the deep politicalization in a sense of science that will go a long way in my view , building rebuilding public trust in our agencies i think that that was a major factor in the loss of confidence among many people in our agencies dealing with this very important issue that affects so many millions of our fellow citizens and i think it will go all long way towards creating that environment here that will allow us to get the job done , as you point out , in a bipartisan faction , which has been a hallmark of this committee under senator kennedy s leadership , i might point out , over the years and the reason we 've been successful with legislative efforts is because we 've had a chairman that has always reached across the aisle to build relationships , as senator enzi pointed out on areas of common interests , we can develop common agendas so i thank you for that and secondly , the mental health issues and again , senator kennedy , senator domenici , paul wellstone , who valiantly fought , as did pete domenici and , of course , senator kennedy , for years on mental health issues it might have got lost in all of the economic debates in the fall in fact , the very day that we passed the economic stabilization act , mental health parity was actually a part of that bill i suspect that under different circumstances , that would 've been the banner headline but because it was the economic issues , it got lost a bit but it was a major step forward for our country huge step forward and and your commitments to to working on that expanding affects so many other aspects of what we talked about here today this is not just another area of health care it is one that absolutely reaches into every other issue that has been raised and so i i'm particularly pleased , tom , about your commitment to this , to that issue , that we not just let this lie there and now as an accomplishment of a congress , but now becomes part of that seamless effort of ours to provide that universal care for our fellow citizens so i am very excited about your nomination , and i'm hopeful as well there s some urgency pointed out we can do with this quickly , get you on the job and roll up our sleeves and go to work on this most critical issue t daschle thank thank you very much , chris kennedy senator harkin \? harkin thank you very much again , mr chairman and again , this has been a great hearing and the kind of attitude , philosophy you 're bringing to this job is just refreshing there were just two other areas i just wanted to cover with you very briefly , tom i would be remiss if i left this room and did n't bring up with you the area concerning people with disabilities in our health care system too often they fall through the cracks too often they go and doctors do n't really know how to treat them there s not that much instruction in our medical schools on how to treat people with disabilities dentists do n't know how to do this we really need to focus a lot in that area secondly , in your book , you wrote that medicaid , quote , is fundamentally geared toward institutional care even though most elderly people prefer to receive care at home or in more personalized community settings i 've expanded to say also people with disabilities , with significant disabilities right now medicaid has to pay for institutional care for a person with a disability but if they want to live at home or in a communitybased setting , medicaid does n't have to pay for that and in between that we have the olmstead decision in which the supreme court said emphatically that it is a constitutional right of a person with a disability to have the least restrictive environment and so , i guess my question is can i count on you to support that what we now call the community choice act it used to be called mi casa \( ph \) i wo n't get into that by the way , i will mention that the first person to introduce this in the house of representatives was newt gingrich , by the way , back in the '90s we 've been trying for years to get this done in other words , to provide that a person with a disability can use that money , that medicaid money for their own choice where they want to live , their own home , their own communitybased setting and so , i would hope that we could ask for your help and your support in that effort daschle well , senator harkin , you 've been the leader , and you 've been the incredible voice of reason and passion when it comes to disabilities and the disability community i have learned a lot in listening to you for many , many years i think that providing as high a quality of life as we can guarantee is a critical goal for us as we look at health reform and as it pertains especially to the disability community providing them with choice is a part of that quality of life and so , i will work with you to see that we get that done and move in that direction recognizing the importance the longterm care today is as much a function of serving the disabled as it is serving the elderly harkin that s right daschle but it ought to be the choice of the disability community as to where they would like to get their care and to live their lives and so , you 've voiced that concern and that vision and i 'd like to work with you to make sure that it s realized harkin i appreciate that , tom , very much and just lastly , i walked into a clinic in carroll , iowa , and i think i saw the future it s a small clinic at a small town and when you walk in the door , it s all electronic record keeping and under one roof they have md , dos , chiropractors , acupuncturists , massage therapists , psychologists and there may be a few others that i \( unknown \) dentists \? i 've been to that place harkin yes , they have dentists here s a place you have n't been \( unknown \) a lot of good it did me , though harkin but this leads to the whole area of integrative medicine there are people out there like dr dean ornish and dr andrew weil and dr mark hyman and these are all mds , but they 've all been promoters bringing together integrative medicine and all the different types of things and a lot of these do lend itself to prevention and wellness and so , i hope that you will look for some way to set up a team or a process or something in your office of health care reform that will bring these very knowledgeable practitioners in i just mentioned those three because there s a lot of others out there , too but to set up some kind of a process where we can look at integrative medicine also in health care reform daschle well , you mentioned some of the finest voices in health that i know and i respect them a great deal , as you do i have long advocated this notion of a medical home and i think integrated care is all about providing efficient care and improved quality at lower costs and that s what you probably saw in that particular facility but we ought to take that model and models like it and make sure that that is the standard by which we judge how well we 're integrating and how well we 're improving the quality in this highperformance system in the future so it s fun to see those i 've been in a few myself and it s just you can see what can be done and what can happen if this integration is made as effectively as they apparently have so i 'd love to work with you on it harkin thank you very much , tom i look forward to working with you daschle thank you , tom kennedy senator sanders \? sanders thank you , senator kennedy senator daschle , one of the issues that i hear a lot of concern about in vermont and i expect all over the country is medicare part d a , it is extraordinarily confusing i mean , literally i have heard from people who have phds that do n't quite know how to find the insurance policy that they need will you work with some of us in several areas , number one , to do away with the doughnut hole , which is very costly now for many seniors who go over the cliff and then have to pay 100 percent out of their own pocket \? and b , will you help us save money by allowing medicare to begin negotiating with the drug companies rather than paying far higher prices , say , than the veterans administration \? daschle well , the answer is yes i would like very much to be able to address the doughnut hole it s one of the bigger financial challenges that we face with regard to the program it s a very expensive fix and we 'll have to work together to see how we find solutions to that i also think that the more we can continue to find innovative ways with which to bring down the costs of drugs and i think that as we look at those innovative ways , giving the secretary the negotiating authority is one of those ways that ought to be evaluated and looked at i think that there s a great deal to be said for that i 've supported it in the past , and i 'd support it in the future sanders on a related issue , a number of years ago , i took a number of my constituents we live on the canadian border over the canadian border to purchase medicine in montreal and many of the people were women who were dealing with breast cancer and they bought a drug called tamoxifen for a fraction of the price they were paying in the united states and many of us for years have been trying to grapple with the issue of why americans are forced to pay by far the highest prices in the world for the same , exact prescription drugs and one of the solutions that some of us have come up with is the idea of prescription drug reimportation will you work with those of us who think that , in fact , americans should be able to purchase safe , fdaapproved medicine from other countries where the prices are substantially lower than they are in the united states \? daschle well , you put your finger on , i think , the most important aspect of this effort , which is to ensure the confidence and safety of the drugs wherever they may come from many of our drugs today are manufactured abroad and imported as domestic product even though they 're manufactured abroad and so , some consistent policy with regard to the manufacture and the sale of all of our drugs , i think , is in order and i 'd love to work with this committee and certainly with you , senator sanders , to make sure that we come up with the best policies to do just that sanders ok senator daschle , thank you very much daschle thank you kennedy let me just have a final word about a couple of areas that we have n't really given much attention to one is the nih , the importance of the nih and the difference that it is making today in the whole area of progress in terms of all the forms of health care and it is doing just an extraordinary job we mentioned the mental health and as you know , we passed recently the mental health parity act , which is extraordinarily important for people across this country it s been referenced during the course of the morning but i just want to underline that for you we did n't also talk about really fda and that s just enormously important we in the congress have not given it the attention , the focus and this is an enormously important agency that has been really left out in terms of recognition and in terms of there were some references here during the course of the hearing , but just really the importance of that and just finally , genetic the importance of genetic discrimination we passed legislation recently in that and the hearings that we had prior to the acceptance of that legislation reminded us all about the importance of that i think i wo n't take up time in going through those areas , but maybe you 'd submit a comment on those and just finally , i think from this morning , as you can see , the enormous interest of the members of this committee on all of these items , you know , that we have on health care we know we have a division in terms of between our committees and we want to work with all of our colleagues to make sure we accommodate those interests but you do get a sense about the depth and breadth of the concerns that the members of this committee have and the great desire to work with you i mean , this has been an extraordinary hearing this morning and you must take away a sense of satisfaction that the desire of the members of this committee to work closely with you and also a recognition of the enormous contribution that you 've already made in this health care area and how all of us on this committee and i know in this instance speak for senator enzi how all of us want to work very closely and just in conclusion , i want to thank senator enzi again for all of his courtesies for us on this committee and the desire to look forward to working with him as well as all the members of our committee in the days ahead so if there s no further business , we 'll stand in recess
, a former assistant secretary of state for african affairs in the clinton administration , faced largely gentle questions from members of the senate committee on foreign relations in confirmation hearings for the post of ambassador to the  the focus seemed balanced between foreign policy issues and the concern that the united states does not get its money s worth from the organization in her opening statement , ms rice , who was the senior foreign policy adviser to the obama campaign , said she would work on four main issues with the overall goal of reinvigorating american leadership at the united nations they are improving the capacity of the united nations to undertake peacekeeping operations providing leadership in addressing preventing both the spread and the use of nuclear weapons and working to alleviate the suffering of the world s poorest ms rice addressed questions about the effectiveness of the organization by pointing out that it was far more economical for the united states to rely on peacekeeping operations led by the united nations than by washington going it alone where united states spent a dollar on such endeavors , the united nations spent 12 cents that is a pretty good deal , said ms rice , whose husband , two young children and parents were seated behind her the prospective ambassador has been quoted extensively that she would never allow a situation like the in rwanda to unroll again , so she was asked repeatedly about how she would confront the government in sudan over the killings in darfur , where more than 200 , 000 people have died since violence between rebels and governmentbacked militias erupted in 2003 , as well as about other crises in africa ms rice said she thought the united states could muster more support from countries like china and russia on sudan or zimbabwe or other issues by stressing through quiet diplomacy where the interests of great powers converge with those of the region she said she the obama administration was determined to curb iran s development of nuclear weapons through a combination of incentives and pressure , although she declined to be more specific the hearings ranged widely , touching on virtually every trouble spot in the world including the congo , somalia , burma and north korea but questions about the fighting in gaza did not emerge until about twothirds of the way through the nearly threehour hearing the two questions came in the context of what to do to stop hamas firing rockets into israel none addressed the heavy civilian toll , now over 1 , 000 , among the population it was ms rice herself who brought up gaza s humanitarian crisis , noting that the incoming obama administration was greatly concerned about the suffering of innocents and on a broader scale determined to forge ahead with a twostate solution there needs to be a durable ceasefire , but a durable ceasefire has to entail the halt to hamas rockets against israel and the israeli people , ms rice said she said those would include effective measures to control weapons smuggling into gaza and an effective means to control the border once the fighting ended , she said , we need to mount a swift and robust effort to attend to the dire humanitarian needs inside gaza
mammoth lakes , calif for many years , cars loaded with skis and snowboards sped past the turnoff to hot creek in the eastern sierra on their way to the mammoth mountain ski area now , some winter visitors are stopping to fly fish at one of california s most fabled trout streams , although not everyone seems pleased hot creek is in a valley framed by the sierra to the west and the glass and inyo mountains to the east this is volcano country , formed by a huge eruption 760 , 000 years ago earthquakes still rattle ski condominiums , and springs provide water to hot creek that is mixed with mountain snowmelt from mammoth creek the result is mineralrich water with stable yearround water temperatures that is ideal for trout the california department of fish and game built a hatchery at hot creek s source in 1936 below the hatchery , a short section of stream is open to the public for catchandrelease flyfishing the stream continues to meander through meadows to a wire fence that marks the start of the private hot creek ranch , where paying anglers are allowed to use only dry flies in the tradition of english chalkstream fishing farther downstream is another public section in a rocky canyon as i fished the upper public section of the stream , steam rose from the geothermal features nearby large , earlyseason baetis mayflies drifted on the water , producing lazy rises from a few trout i cast a tiny fly tied with cdc cul de canard fluffy feathers from a duck s rear end that have a natural buoyancy but the fish were not having anything to do with my offerings i was able to fish in winter because the fish and game commission voted to open hot creek and several other streams in the eastern sierra to yearround catchandrelease fishing in 2007 some local anglers and fishing guides protested the decision and lobbied for a return to the previous regulations that closed fishing from november to the end of april kevin peterson , a guide and the manager of the hot creek ranch , which is open only during the traditional season , fought the regulation change he said he felt that the fish were under tremendous pressure despite their numbers they get their butts kicked during the summer and need the winter off , he said in a telephone interview but the notion that fish need a rest over the winter is an anthropomorphic myth , according to the california department of fish and game senior biologist dave lentz the reality for wild trout is there is no such thing as rest , lentz said in a telephone interview if you are n't paying attention to what s going around you , you do n't continue to exist as a wild trout there are too many predators other western states , including montana , idaho , new mexico and utah , have yearround troutfishing seasons fishery managers say angling pressure is lower in winter because fewer anglers brave the elements colder winter water holds more oxygen , so it would be better for the fish to have a closed season in the dog days of august , according to roger bloom , a senior fisheries biologist who oversees california s wild and heritage trout program more stress on trout comes from anglers fishing in slowmoving water in the heat of summer my flies were not causing the trout any stress the fish ignored them so i moved downstream to where the creek flows though a narrow canyon i hiked down a trail partly covered with snow to the stream below more anglers were trying their luck the fish were there a survey by the fish and game department last fall found that there were more than 10 , 000 trout per mile in some sections of hot creek , and the average density was more than 8 , 000 fish per mile that is probably the highest density of trout anywhere in california there are big fish here , too the survey netted a sixpound brown trout at the end of the canyon , hot springs in the creek attract bathers , although the area has been closed to bathing since 2006 when scalding temperatures made it too dangerous the hot springs also form a fish barrier , part of the reason there are so many fish in hot creek but none of the thousands of fish were feeding on the surface , so i switched to a nymph fly hot creek fish have a reputation for being hard to catch some fly fishers swear that the trout have a phd in entomology but i managed to hook and release a small rainbow and a brown trout that must have missed the seminar on small mayfly nymphs calling it a day , i hiked out of the canyon mount morrison , a spectacular snowcapped triangular sierra peak more than 12 , 000 feethigh , rose to the west , and i could see the ski runs on mammoth mountain farther to the north the next day , it began to snow

is your financial well being guaranteed simply by virtue of obtaining a college education \? recent evidence suggests that college graduates are no longer receiving the same bang for the buck a generation ago , financing a college education included scholarships , grants and modest amounts of loans soaring tuition , combined with fewer grants , however , has left the majority of students today with no choice but to incur huge debt so now we have the educated poor , with student loan debt leaving ever more college graduates and young professionals unable to buy a house or start a family or a small business read more in 1995 , when i decided to borrow the maximum amounts on both the subsidized and unsubsidized federal stafford loans to attend law school , like so many others , i never even considered that i might wind up in a relatively low paying , but highly fulfilling public sector job there s little assistance for those who find themselves unable to keep up with their student loan payments for whatever reason student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy , there s a financial disincentive for lenders to help keep you out of default , and the financial options that do exist , like forbearance and deferrals , are ultimately so costly that they border on usury \( i didn t really give much consideration to what student loan forbearance was until i availed myself of it , and then watched as the amount i owed ballooned by nearly 20 , 000 during the time i served the community \) until higher education becomes a safe investment again , prospective borrowers should give greater thought to the financial consequences of seeking an advanced degree community colleges and state schools are probably better places to find oneself , than expensive private institutions , particularly if the student doesn t really know what he or she wants to do for a living associates degrees and trade schools are other avenues to consider none of this is to suggest that a liberal arts education isn t good for the mind and spirit but whether it s as wise a financial investment as it once was requires serious consideration is an associate professor of economics at the robins school of business at the university of richmond he does research and consulting on the economics of higher education a great deal has been written about the onerous debt levels taken on by some of today s college students much of this discussion grossly overstates the true degree of burden that student loans place on most graduates an overwhelming majority of students have reasonable and manageable levels of student loans the typical fouryear undergraduate student loan package totals approximately 19 , 000 no more than a midsized car an automobile begins depreciating the minute you drive it off the lot , while one s college degree is an investment that will garner you a lifetime of higher earnings from strictly an investment standpoint , a college education , even with 20 , 000 in student loans is a sound investment the median earnings of a college graduate in the united states is approximately 50 , 000 per year , while the equivalent for a high school graduate is about 30 , 000 per year so having to assume the usual package of student loans will pay for itself in just one year read more over the course of a 40year career this difference in earnings translates into 800 , 000 \( ignoring interest \) clearly , assuming a reasonable level of student loans is well worth the investment how difficult will it be to pay back one s student loans \? a total of 20 , 000 in student loans would require a payment of approximately 250 per month for 10 years some personal financial planners suggest that student loans should not exceed 10 to 15 percent of one s gross earnings under this rule , an annual salary of between 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 would be sufficient to pay off the loan without due hardship this level of income is below the earnings of most college graduates , and a new government program adjusts monthly payments based on one s level of income making repayment even more affordable \( finaidorg has excellent loan calculators that students can use to input their own information \) much has also been said about student loans forcing young people to make career choices that they otherwise would not have made \( ie pushing them into more lucrative fields like business or law rather than careers in public service or the nonprofit sector \) but there s little convincing evidence that that is happening while some students may have onerously high levels of debt , most have quite manageable levels of borrowing with a dose of caution and planning students should not be deterred from taking out loans for their college education is the founder of studentloanjusticeorg the most obvious advice for incoming or prospective students is this don t borrow based on a 2003 study by the inspector general of the department of education , it is probably conservative to say that about 1 in 3 borrowers wind up in default on their student loans , and the consequences of this are often catastrophic despite the various repayment programs that make student loans seem friendly and generous , make no mistake most standard consumer protections including bankruptcy protections , statutes of limitations , refinancing rights and others have been stripped from student loans , and there is no indication that these will be restored anytime soon this has led to a large number of decent citizens being forced to either pay back many multiples of what they originally borrowed , or drop off the grid when they cannot pay in the absence of meaningful congressional action to address this problem , avoiding student loan debt altogether is clearly the first and best piece of advice for prospective students and their families read more while this advice is easy to give , it is much harder to follow , especially given that nearly 70 percent of college students leave school with student loans however , it is worthwhile to keep this as a goal , even if it cannot be completely met students should exhaust all nonloan financial aid opportunities to the greatest extent possible scholarships , work study , grants and other forms of aid that do not require repayment should be actively pursued when considering one s choice of college , cost to the student should be a primary factor students should apply to multiple colleges and examine closely the financial packages of each in many , if not most instances , students should not be overly swayed by a college s claim of being the best in a given field of study students should look at the school s graduation rates , average length of attendance \( ie are students likely to graduate in 4 years or 5 \? \) , default rates for graduates and any other student data most schools have this information available on request in general , be very , very wary of new schools with no track record , or any forprofit schools particularly those that advertise incessantly on television culinary schools , photography schools , chiropractic colleges , cosmetology schools , truck driving schools , flight schools and other specialized institutes have notoriously bad track records with those in the studentloanjustice community , and these schools can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars , if not far more often these schools are nonaccredited , and students applying for loans for them have no choice but to take out high interest , private loans they have an alarming propensity toward closing , leaving students with the bill , but no degree or an education , a staff writer at , is the author of generation debt and blogs at she is writing a book on the future of higher education a good rule of thumb for student borrowers is that your total graduating debt should be less than the expected starting salary in your likely field that can range widely , of course , from 36 , 000 for liberal arts majors to more than 60 , 000 for engineers it s also a good idea to stay to the low end of that scale if you plan on pursuing any kind of unpredictable creative field journalism comes to mind or if you want to go on to graduate school , which usually requires taking on more debt i think it s important for high school graduates to think longterm in this way about the connection between their degree and their eventual job lots of 18yearolds have no idea what they want to do , of course that s all the more reason to err on the cautious side in terms of debt read more in fact , for young people who completely lack a sense of direction and , more important , zeal for their higher education , i would urge them to think about taking some time off before going to college burn off steam , work , travel , volunteer , explore creative interests and tickle your academic fancy by browsing through free course material at sites like mit s opencourseware if you need some time to find yourself , that s great it doesn t have to cost you and your family thousands of dollars in tuition once you are ready for class , there are several ways to limit borrowing without necessarily giving up your dream school plan diligently to finish that degree faster by supplementing your study with summer or online classes attend a twoyear college at first and then transfer this is an increasingly popular option live at home for a year work more hours \( although more than 20 hours a week can be hard to balance with fulltime learning \) most students i know who really let the loans pile up did so without planning it these days , no one can afford to be without a plan is the associate director of the center for educational freedom at the cato institute there are countless decisions to make , based entirely on what you want , when choosing a college is an institution too big or too small \? urban u or leafy tech \? the list goes on and on there is one crucial factor , however , that is heavily influenced by much more than your personal preferences the cost what you ll be willing and able to pay depends very much on what other people sometimes voluntarily , often against their will will pay for you and that s the cause of the biggest problems in college selection rampant inflation that renders prices nearly worthless in judging any institution s real value according to inflationadjusted college board data , in the 199091 school year the average , fulltimeequivalent undergraduate received 2 , 640 in grant aid and 1 , 548 in inexpensive federal loans by 200708 , the former had risen to 4 , 656 and the latter to 3 , 650 read more in light of that , it s no wonder that total , inflationadjusted charges in that same period rose 63 percent at fouryear public schools and 55 percent at fouryear private colleges people other than the customers were handling everbigger chunks of the bill so is a college really worth the price \? who knows \? you may only be willing to attend after taking into account the aid you ll receive but then the college will soak someone else , often taxpayers , for the amount that you didn t think worth paying ultimately , how you weigh the innumerable factors in choosing a college is entirely up to you but the cost \? you d do well to consider how inflated college prices are , and who will be paying much of your bill
people who care about conserving open space are allowing themselves a bit of hope that the federal government finally will deliver on promises it made to the american people more than four decades ago in 1965 , congress created the land and water conservation fund to provide a steady source of money for the acquisition of threatened lands , the protection of significant landmarks and the expansion of outdoor recreational opportunities the money would come from offshore oil and gas leases , giving the program an interesting symmetry dollars raised from depleting one natural resource would be used to protect others the program has rescued millions of acres from development but it has never been allowed to live up to its potential since 1980 , spending has been authorized at 900 million annually split evenly between federal and state projects but actual appropriations have been much smaller the last decade has been especially rough , despite former president george w bush s campaign promise to fully fund the program for the present fiscal year , congress appropriated only 155 million , and none of it for the states offshore royalties spin off billions every year but congress routinely diverts the money to the general treasury for deficit reduction , and the white house , no matter who occupies it , rarely pushes back president obama s budget offers a better deal 420 million for the next fiscal year and the full funding of 900 million by 2014 these numbers are heartening federal dollars are needed to complete longpending acquisitions across the country , from hawaii to yellowstone national park to virginia states are particularly hard pressed gov david paterson of new york plans to raid the state s only land conservation program in order to reduce the deficit promises , however , are only as good as the president wants them to be we hope that president obama remembers his

concord , nh a committee of the new hampshire state senate plunged wednesday into the escalating debate over , hearing hours of discordant testimony on whether the state should become the fifth to allow it the state s house of representatives narrowly approved a bill last month that would legalize marriage for samesex couples , and the public hearing before the senate judiciary committee came on the heels of victories for samesex marriage in iowa and vermont but with the full senate preparing to vote on the measure as soon as next week , its chances remain uncertain there are more votes in doubt here than there were in vermont last week , when supporters needed five house members to change their minds and override gov jim douglas s vote of the bill allowing samesex marriage there in new hampshire , democrats control the 24member senate , but many have not disclosed how they will vote on the bill , which would take effect in january none of the nine republicans in the senate are expected to support it one seat is vacant until a special election next week gov john lynch , a democrat , opposes samesex marriage , but he has not said whether he would veto the bill he signed a law in 2007 allowing civil unions between samesex couples the governor believes marriage is reserved for a union between a man and a woman , colin manning , mr lynch s press secretary , said after the hearing to the extent that federal law allows , our civil union law ensures that all families in our state have the same rights and protections testimony was generally split between people who oppose samesex marriage for religious reasons and supporters who believe that marriage , whether between heterosexuals or homosexuals , is a civil right many opponents also testified that children need a mother and a father , an argument that failed to sway the vermont legislature as in vermont , proponents of samesex marriage testified that civil unions relegate gay men and lesbians to a separate and unequal category i am better than to get on the bus and still sit in the back , said amy wright of concord , who said she had worn a wedding band for nine years even though the state would not recognize her relationship with another woman as marriage i want to sit in the front of the bus but bradley giuda of epsom said the purpose of marriage was to procreate and allowing gay people to marry would threaten civilization what is proposed , mr giuda said , is a perversion of the very fabric of our country new hampshire would be the fifth state , after massachusetts , connecticut , iowa and vermont , to legalize samesex marriage the vermont vote came days after the iowa supreme court legalized samesex marriage in that state , and gayrights groups are hoping that momentum from the backtoback victories will spill into new hampshire and other states in new england , a campaign is under way to extend marriage rights to gay men and lesbians in all six of the region s states by 2012 but new hampshire presents a steeper challenge than vermont , partly because the senate here is more politically divided the senate majority leader , maggie hassan , who has not publicly shared her opinion of samesex marriage , said that senate democrats were still having a lot of discussions and that the testimony on wednesday would figure heavily into their decisions i think that is likely to guide a number of us , ms hassan said we like to talk to each other and hear each others' thoughts out as well , and we try to do that privately she said the full senate could vote on the measure any time between next week and midmay if some democrats calculate that supporting the bill could endanger their seats , the senate could decide to table the measure until after the 2010 elections the house has passed a number of socially progressive bills this year including one that would repeal the death penalty and another that would legalize medical use of marijuana but the senate is unlikely to go along with all of them , said jennifer donahue , political director of the new hampshire institute of politics at st anselm college i would n't be surprised if we saw the senate voting in a more conservative and restrained way , ms donahue said , because they feel they have to moderate what the house passed
after making discreet inquiries to studios around town , the baquette has discovered that the preoscar party scene has been scaled way back this year yes , they are taking place , but they are smaller , some in the form of intimate dinners rather than gigantic parties poolside at some luxury hotel variety reports that hollywood is exercising this newfound restraint either because of issues of taste \( there s a recession going on \) or scant resources why , this year , the seventh annual night before party , held at the beverly hills hotel to benefit the motion picture television fund , is cutting out the gift bags what s next \? are they going to replace those big shrimp that are the size of an infant s elbow with those nasty little ones that are more fit for goldfish \? last night , a few people got their party on the envelope cohosted an event with the hollywood museum featuring costumes from revolutionary road and doubt but the most eyepopping part of the collection came from tom o neil , chief scribe of the envelope and relentless hardware hound he had a golden globes award , given out by the hollywood foreign press association , on which the word foreign was misspelled and a real vintage oscar for the 1946 film anna and the king of siam and he also had framed membership cards for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences from none other than katharine hepburn , who said she never cared much about the oscars these prove what a lying diva she was , said mr o neil last night , the wrap , the new web site headed by veteran entertainment reporter sharon waxman , held a panel at the four seasons featuring marc shmuger of universal and jeff dossett of yahoo on the future of the movie industry that was followed by cocktails , during which there was plenty of chatter about whether the tweaked award show this year will move the needle on the ratings tonight , overture films will host a small affair for richard jenkins , to celebrate his best actor nomination for the visitor but only executives , production people and mr jenkins s friends and family are invited press coverage is not desired , and the folks there declined to reveal where the party was taking place , although they apologized profusely that we weren t invited fox searchlight is hosting a party for the wrestler and slumdog millionaire , but it is so guest exclusive that publicists are phoning invited guests rather than sending out invitations they re also being cagey about divulging party location the weinstein company just decided on a small party for the reader and kate winslet , but gave out no more details except to say don t worry , if you re invited you ll know neither paramout nor disney seems to be making any party plans , or at least they re not telling but elton john s annual bash , a fundraiser , will go on as usual and the vanity fair party is back , following its cancellation last year because of the writers strike but it has been moved to a smaller location , sunset towers , and the invitation list has been slashed by half so the most coveted ticket in town party just became a little more coveted
laurie shrage sounded a bit like a college basketball coach in a telephone interview on thursday , shrage , the director of women s studies at florida international university said she hoped to use the university s hiring of the former knicks coach isiah thomas to spread awareness about the significance of sexual harassment she called the opportunity a teachable moment , a favorite cliche of coaches of the numerous infamous moments in thomas s tenure with the knicks , none stood out more than him being the focus of a sexual discrimination case in which a federal jury awarded a female former knicks executive more than 11 million shrage said she and numerous other women s study faculty at fiu were disappointed in the hiring but felt they could do little to change it she said one of the first things that she and her colleagues planned on doing was walking over to thomas s office and hand delivering a copy of the university s sexual harassment policy he may choose to not accept it from us in person , shrage said we re going to walk it over there rather than sending it to him because it shows that we re concerned and he s aware of it and that he ll read it other ideas that shrage has include a teachin where the university invites experts on sexual harassment to speak on the topic and a meeting with the new fiu president to make sure that they are behind the university s sexual harassment policy we want to hear a commitment that thomas will be expected to go through some kind of sexual harassment training , she said calls to attempt to reach thomas and fiu s athletic director , pete garcia , were not returned she said that the reaction of people around the university had been mixed it doesn t look like it s a good decision because of this lawsuit , shrage said of thomas s hiring i can only think that the university thought it was an opportunity , that it was an opportunity to get a kind of coach we wouldn t be able to get the worry is that they re putting the basketball team ahead of the academic mission of the university she said one of the key factors in whether thomas s tenure would be a success or failure would be whether he had learned from his mistakes he has to set the tone and be a different kind of role model than he s been , shrage said i don t think anyone can say until we see how he behaves whether it was a good or a bad decision
santiago , when a devastating virus swept through chile s farmed stocks last year , some of the industry s biggest players laid off thousands of workers , packed up operations and moved to unspoiled waters farther south along the chilean coast but the virus went with them last month , the chilean government began hashing out tougher measures to improve the sanitary and environmental conditions of the troubled industry but producers expect still deeper losses this year , as the virus continues to kill millions of fish slated for export to the united states and other countries government and industry officials say they have already taken important steps to improve the ways salmon are farmed but the persistent problems , critics say , reveal that neither the industry nor the government has fully grasped the need for the farreaching changes required to protect not only consumers and the environment , but also one of chile s most important industries from itself they are not the only ones concerned in the midst of the virus crisis , chile has continued to raise salmon for export with chemicals and medications not approved for use in the united states and europe , according to documents from regulators while the united states says chile made some progress in tackling its problems , it will keep chilean imports of farmed fish under special scrutiny for the time being chilean government officials and industry officials say the troubles are part of the growing pains of a 2 billion industry that in less than two decades built itself into the world s second largest exporter and the biggest supplier of salmon to the united states the virus afflicting the fish , infectious salmon anemia , or isa , is not harmful to humans , they note but after the new york times reported on chile s dying farmed fish last year , some buyers , like the supermarket giant safeway , restricted imports from chile the troubles spurred the chilean government to step up its controls last year sernapesca , chile s national fishing service , tripled its inspections of farmed fish , said felix inostroza , the agency s director among other things , the measures now being weighed by the chilean congress , which are expected to be passed before april , would thin the density of salmon pens , where overcrowding has contributed to the virus s spread , and reduce the use of antibiotics the authorities also plan to organize aquaculture permits into neighborhoods , where salmon companies will be required build in rest periods between production cycles , to give the marine environment time to recover , said rodrigo infante , general manager of salmonchile , the industry association but environmental groups say they will continue to lobby for tougher changes it is not enough for the industry to voluntarily police itself , said andrea kavanagh , manager of the salmon aquaculture reform campaign for the pew environment group in washington for too long , the government has ceded to industry convenience , she added , permitting chemicals known to harm its environment as well as consumers her group obtained fda inspection reports last year in an open records request showing that chilean producers had used three chemicals that are effectively banned in the united states industry and chilean government officials say the chemicals are not harmful to consumers when used the right way just because a substance is not allowed for use does not necessarily mean it poses a risk to human health , said alicia gallardo , the head of the aquaculture unit of sernapesca but chilean companies have struggled to comply with the regulations of other countries , particularly as they cope with a parasitic bacteria , rickettsia , carried by sea lice , which causes infectionprone lesions the industry is using antiparasitic treatments like emamectin benzoate , a pesticide fed to the fish , to treat the lice infestations , and antibiotics to control the resulting infections fda officials said that emamectin could be used in limited cases in the united states , but that it was one of the three prohibited chemicals that were highlighted in fda inspection documents last april the others were oxolinic acid and the antibiotic flumequine , according to the fda inspection reports recovered by the pew environmental group copies of the documents were shared with the new york times and their authenticity verified by fda officials , including donald kraemer , the fda s deputy director in the office for  in response to the findings last year , he said , the fda put three firms cultivadores de salmones linao ltda , empresas aquachile and alimentos cuisine solutions on an import alert , which required that they prove shipments were drugfree the fda lifted the alert after the companies put in added controls , mr kraemer said from may to july , the fda also increased the number of fish samples it tested from chile , he said none of the fda tests came up positive for any banned drugs but , mr kraemer said , the fda does not have a reliable way to test for emamectin empresas aquachile declined to comment on the fda inspections alex miquel , the chief executive of alimentos cuisine solutions , said that since being notified of its violations in october the company began testing each batch of salmon that it purchased from other companies in emailed responses , lvaro jim nez , managing director of chile operations for marine harvest , which controls cultivadores , noted that the fda alert was not based on detection of drug residues in the fish , but rather on documents detailing the company s drug control procedures at the plant we are now in line with the requirements , he said the chilean firms did not stop using the drugs , said mr kraemer of the fda rather , they increased the withdrawal period for the fish the length of time they hold the fish after they are treated with the drugs , he said still not fully satisfied , the fda has scheduled a system review for this march in chile , where it will work with its counterpart in chile , sernapesca , to address how the country will deal with its fish diseases we need to be able to know if they can control it on their side of the ocean , so we do n't have to do it on our side , mr kraemer said chilean government officials , concerned about job losses in the south , say they are determined to reform the industry but this has to be done with incentives , said hugo lavados , chile s economy minister in november , the government announced that it would provide 120 million in loan guarantees

cairo s sixmonthold political crisis flared up again on sunday as the hardline leadership admonished protesters for damaging pictures of ayatollah and as the opposition countered that the charges were fabricated to justify another aggressive crackdown as hundreds of students protested sunday within the walled compound of tehran university , riot police officers surrounded the campus , raising the prospect of yet another violent confrontation between the authorities and protesters in this increasingly intractable conflict for all the charges and countercharges that have been raised during the crisis including vote rigging , the rape of jailed protesters and the plotting of a velvet revolution each side seemed to agree that burning an image of ayatollah khomeini , the father of the state who is revered as divine , was going too far the opposition has rebutted charges that its supporters were responsible for the trampling , ripping or burning of images of ayatollah khomeini that were broadcast on statecontrolled television after student protests spread across the nation on dec 7 thousands of students clashed with basij militia members at universities across iran , in the largest protest rallies in months since then , state television has broadcast images of the damaged pictures none of the videos showed clearly who was responsible over the weekend , thousands of government supporters protested across iran , denouncing the supposed desecration of the pictures the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , denounced the act to clerics on sunday , and suggested that the state would continue to use force rather than dialogue or compromise to stop future protests he said that all opposition rallies were illegal and that he would not tolerate any more challenges to the credibility of president mahmoud ahmadinejad s landslide reelection but several iranians expressed doubt about the government s version of events , including a representative of a foundation headed by the grandson of ayatollah khomeini the representative , mohammadali khosroi , a spokesman for the foundation , the institute for the compilation and publication of the works of imam khomeini , described the images as wholly suspicious and condemned iran s state station for wounding the spirit of the people by broadcasting them mir hussein moussavi , a former presidential candidate and the principal leader of the opposition movement , said tearing up pictures of ayatollah khomeini was wholly suspicious and antirevolutionary , adding i am confident that university students would not commit such a principlebreaking act in a broader sense , the protests and clashes even as the establishment supporters of the opposition , former government insiders , clerics and contemporaries of ayatollah khomeini , have focused on repairing the damaged system , which they say has become corrupt and illegitimate like the last soviet leader , mikhail gorbachev , who wanted to fix the communist system rather than end it , these opposition figures want to preserve the basic tenets of their hybrid religiouscivilian state but the increasingly radicalized nature of the recent protests , and if true , the burning and trampling of images of ayatollah khomeini , suggested that mr moussavi and others from his generation now at the helm of the opposition were out of step with many of those they were ostensibly leading , some iran experts said the repression has certainly radicalized a part of this potentially majority constituency , which means that not only the regime , but also the antiregime , is more divided than the demonstrations that followed the elections , said a european diplomat with years of service in iran who asked not to be identified in accordance with diplomatic protocol by late sunday there was no word if the hundreds of police officers surrounding the university would stand down , or rush the students again
even for 15 billion , the engineers of the new yankee stadium could not keep it from shaking they could not have tested for that , anyway it comes from postseason passion , in the stands and on the field , the kind that has surfaced in the bronx more than anywhere else the stormed past the in game 2 of their division series friday , tying it in the ninth inning on a tworun homer by and winning in the 11th , 43 , on by the ball just cleared the 318foot sign and sent the crowd of 50 , 006 into sudden delirium the emotions of this game were unbelievable , manager joe girardi said the emotions were up , down and all around the yankees have taken a twogamestonone lead in the division series for the first time in 10 years unless the twins beat them in the metrodome on sunday and monday , the yankees will play their next home game on oct 16 in the opener of the american league championship series teixeira had seven singles for the angels last season in a division series loss this year , he was 0 for 7 before a ninthinning single off joe nathan that preceded rodriguez s homer that hit was important , but the yankees did not give teixeira 180 million last winter just to hit singles he tied for the american league lead in homers this season , with 39 , and most of his shots were nodoubters off the bat this one was different , a laser to left on a 2and1 fastball at 91 miles an hour from the lefthander jose mijares teixeira ran hard , and he stuck his index finger to the sky as he rounded first it was the first gameending postseason homer for the yankees since , and the first gameending hit for teixeira as a yankee he happily took the ritual pie in the face from a j burnett , the starter who worked six strong innings with the backup catcher , jose molina i really thought it was a double , teixeira said i hit it with so much topspin i thought there was no chance it was going out the crowd started going nuts , and then i knew it was a home run it was a sudden and emphatic end to a twisting and turning game the yankees had runners at the corners with one out in the 10th , but johnny damon lined to short and brett gardner was doubled off third then the twins loaded the bases with no outs in the 11th before dave robertson survived with a line out , a force at the plate on a grounder and a fly to center the twins might have scored , but the umpire phil cuzzi missed a call down the line with joe mauer batting against damaso marte mauer sliced a ball that hit melky cabrera s glove and landed several inches inside the foul line cuzzi immediately called it foul , negating a double , and though mauer singled , the extra base might have helped the twins phil cuzzi saw the ball as foul , called what he saw , said the umpire crew chief , tim tschida , who acknowledged that the call was wrong after seeing a replay there s a guy sitting over in the umpire s dressing room right now that feels horrible jason kubel singled off marte , but mauer advanced only to second when michael cuddyer singled off robertson , mauer held at third then robertson stifled delmon young , carlos gomez and brendan harris he was outstanding , said francisco cervelli , the thirdstring catcher who caught the 11th inning i never felt he was scared it was a missed opportunity the twins rued , but not their first of the game the twins blew their best chance when their allstar closer and highestpaid player this season , nathan , could not convert the save in the ninth nathan also lost a lead in game 2 of the division series in 2004 , faltering in his third inning of work as the yankees evened that series rodriguez beat him then , too , with a gametying double this time nathan was fresh , but the ninth inning was a minefield he could not cross the first three hitters teixeira , rodriguez and hideki matsui were 12 for 24 against him in their regularseason careers teixeira lashed a single to the rightfield corner then nathan threw three breaking balls out of the strike zone to rodriguez he got a called strike with a fastball , then tried another at 94 miles an hour rodriguez unloaded on it , a homer off the bat he looked to the home dugout and pumped his fist , the ball soaring into a glove in the yankees' bullpen you feel so good , rodriguez said you grind out an atbat against one of the best closers in the game , and you get a favorable count and you get a pitch in your wheelhouse , and obviously you do n't want to miss it and the fun part is i was just thinking base hit , hit the ball hard somewhere it was 33 , and the stadium throbbed with noise , the fans shaking it to its foundation rodriguez , who failed consistently and spectacularly with men on base across his last four octobers , is 4 for 8 this series with five runs batted in i think he s in a great place this year , girardi said he s been huge in the playoffs so far for us it s great because he gets the rest every other day for us , and we can keep him strong
waltham , mass speaking publicly for the first time on a proposal to close the rose art museum at brandeis university to the public , the family of the museum s benefactors sharply criticized university officials on monday for what it called a planned plundering of its collection the family insisted that the museum remain open and that none of its works be sold to raise money the university s trustees voted in january to close the museum and sell its works , which are estimated to be worth about 350 million the university later backtracked , saying the rose would remain open as an academic fine arts center , but not a public museum it has put together a panel to help determine the museum s fate its first meeting is thursday repurposing' the museum is closing by another name , 50 family members said in a statement released monday night at a symposium at the rose it would not be the rose any other understanding of the university s current plan is disinformation the art has been put on the auction block the museum has been put on the chopping block in an interview , meryl rose , speaking for the family , said the university s initial announcement had already harmed the museum what donor would give a piece of art that might be sold to pay for administrative expenses \? ms rose said this was meant to be a public art museum when it was built it can be nothing but in addition to demanding that the museum continue , the family wants the university to renew the contracts of its director , michael rush , and staff and to make plans for new exhibits the current exhibit is scheduled to end in may joseph baerlein , a brandeis spokesman , questioned the timing of the family s statement , saying that no firm decisions would be made until the panel came up with a plan it s really exaggerating what s happening right now and what is going to begin thursday , mr baerlein said in a statement , the brandeis provost , marty wyngaarden krauss , said the museum will remain open with a desired goal of being more fully integrated into the university s core educational mission what precise role the museum will have will be informed by the recommendations of the rose committee to the brandeis board , ms krauss said brandeis initially decided to close the museum to help raise operating money for the university , whose endowment has dropped by 30 percent in the past year the university , which faces up to a 79 million budget gap in the next five years , has raised tuition and fees , trimmed expenses and left positions vacant the museum was started in 1961 with a 1 million gift from ed and bertha rose the rose family claims the museum has three funds set up to ensure its survival , but brandeis disputes that the massachusetts attorney general s office is reviewing whether selling the art would violate the terms of wills and donations edward dangel , a lawyer for the chairman of the museum s board who has been contacted by members of the rose family , said there had been little discussion with the university right now we 're not at a crisis point , but we 're coming close to a crisis point , mr dangel said if the university does n't relent and change its position in the next few months , the donors and the trustees will take action to test whether the intent of the donors has been honored here the family spoke monday before a symposium on art and museums in the financial crisis dozens of people , many wearing buttons saying save the rose , attended , and signs protesting the rose s closing were affixed to its front windows
martins ferry , ohio it was big news in this town of 7 , 200 in june when and her husband , , came here to see a surrogate mother give birth to their twin daughters a steady stream of to east ohio regional hospital , hoping to catch a glimpse of the two movie stars but that was topped on july 31 , when two local police chiefs were arrested on charges of conspiring to break into the surrogate s house , stealing items and offering to sell them to photographers for tabloid magazines people are still talking about it , said harold schwender , 66 , a retired steel worker everyone s been pretty excited by it , but they 're all waiting for act ii the trial the two police chiefs barry p carpenter , 39 , the chief here , and chad m dojack , 29 , the chief in nearby bridgeport , have pleaded not guilty , as has a third man charged in the case all are free on bond , and both chiefs have been suspended the only public defense offered so far is chief carpenter s explanation to local reporters that he had been in the surrogate s home because he had noticed the door was open he said he had met with the photographers , but just to joke around with them the authorities do not see it that way the case is one of the most disturbing i 've ever seen , said sheriff fred thompson of belmont county , where martins ferry and bridgeport are located as a law enforcement officer , you try to live your public life and your private life to a higher standard , sheriff thompson added that did n't happen here t shawn hervey , the special prosecutor who filed the criminal charges , sees the crime growing out of america s fascination with celebrities i just think that , but for our nation s obsession with stars and every intrinsic detail of their lives , these crimes do n't happen , mr hervey said the shock and awe factor , though , is that it s two local chiefs of police who are alleged to have committed this crime the two chiefs had worked together for seven years in the martins ferry department chief carpenter faces up to 21 years in prison if convicted , and chief dojack up to nine years the alleged scheme was revealed by a freelance celebrity photographer , justin steffman , who told the surrogate , michelle ross , about it i felt sorry for the girl , what these guys did to her , mr steffman said in an interview they should n't have their jobs and they should have to pay the consequences the drama began april 28 , when magazine broke the news that ms parker and mr broderick were working with a surrogate living in eastern ohio we 've certainly broken bigger stories , but this was way up there , said candace trunzo , star s editor in chief by may 8 , news accounts identifying ms ross and martins ferry , about 60 miles southwest of pittsburgh , as the location , were in newspapers and magazines all over the world for reasons that are not clear , according to the criminal indictment , on may 8 , chief carpenter used his police computer to gain access to information about ms ross illegally the authorities said he did not act on any information he found , though , until five days later , on may 13 , when , by chance , mr steffman said he and the other two photographers checked into a motel in nearby blaine owned by the third suspect , bruce j callarik , 50 , who is chief dojack s fatherinlaw mr callarik is also the son of bridgeport s mayor , john callarik , who appointed mr dojack chief last year all three suspects were respected members of the community , particularly the chiefs who were hometown boys who wanted to do right by their towns and become local police officers , said mayor phil wallace of martins ferry after the photographers said they were looking for information about ms ross s location , bruce callarik called chief dojack , the indictment said chief dojack then met with mr steffman , who said chief dojack asked for 1 , 000 for two addresses mr steffman said he offered 300 the next day , mr steffman said , chief dojack called and said he had more on michelle ross than we could possibly imagine and that you will probably want to get a wire transfer for the amount of stuff we have on her later that day , the three photographers met with chief dojack and chief carpenter in a post office parking lot chief carpenter said he had been in ms ross s home and had a poem from her refrigerator , an album of photos , legal documents about the surrogacy agreement and pictures of ultrasounds , and he showed them a cellphone picture of a belly cast , said mr steffman , who said he could not recall how much money the chiefs asked for at that time the photographers were never actually shown the items , except for the cellphone picture , and none of the items have been recovered but mr hervey points out that the items the chiefs offered are the only things missing from ms ross s home the photographers turned the chiefs down , telling them they wanted ms ross s whereabouts only to get a picture of her that angered chief carpenter , who walked away in midconversation , mr steffman said on may 15 , mr steffman sent ms ross an email message telling her what had happened the next day , a representative from the surrogacy agency , fertility futures international , went to the sheriff s office to report the breakin , according to the sheriff s incident report at a court hearing thursday , the suspects were told that their trials , scheduled for later this year , could be delayed because one of the two main investigators was seriously injured recently the delay will not stop residents of the two towns from debating every point of the case , from who might plead guilty , to whether there is any hard evidence to whether ms parker and mr broderick will come back to testify and what ms parker might wear to the trial
mexico city , vowing to confront that are sowing chaos in our communities , called thursday for the senate to ratify a longstalled treaty aimed at curbing illegal arms trafficking but mr obama also suggested that he would not press lawmakers to revive an expired ban on assault weapons on the first day of a fourday swing through latin america that will also take him to trinidad and tobago , mr obama declared a new era of cooperation and partnership between the united states and the first american president since bill clinton to visit mexico s capital , mr obama hoped to shore up the efforts of his mexican counterpart , president , to combat the rising tide of crossborder drug violence but while the two pledged their shared responsibility in the drug wars during a news conference here , they seemed to diverge on the issue of the assault weapons ban , which mr calder n said nearly 90 percent of the weapons seized in mexico could be traced to the united states , adding that organized crime increased after the ban expired mr obama campaigned on a platform of renewing it , but he suggested thursday that reviving the ban was politically impossible because of opposition from gun enthusiasts none of us are under any illusion that reinstating that ban would be easy , mr obama said , while insisting he was not backing off at all from his conviction that renewing the ban made sense mr obama s meeting with mr calder n touched on a range of issues , including policy , and a dispute over whether mexican trucks should be allowed to deliver goods inside the united states but the overarching issue was drug violence the obama administration had already pledged to send more agents to patrol the border with mexico and more helicopters to mexico but on thursday the president went a step further , announcing that he would press the senate to ratify the longstalled interamerican arms treaty , which the united states had a major hand in negotiating through the  the treaty , signed by president clinton , stalled in the senate , but went into effect in 1998 after two dozen other nations ratified it the treaty seeks to crack down on illicit firearms by , among other things , establishing a system for the import , export and transfer of firearms , and by fostering cooperation among law enforcement agencies investigating illegal trafficking it makes good policy sense , said peter deshazo , a former senior state department official who has advocated ratifying the pact it s very hard for the united states to call on other countries to cooperate on controlling the flow of illegal arms if we have n't ratified a major interamerican convention but it is unclear what type of reception the treaty will receive now in washington aides to mr obama said he was working closely with senator harry reid of nevada , the democratic leader , to get the treaty ratified , but mr reid issued a statement that offered no commitment to bring it up for a vote on capitol hill , a senior democratic official said that despite the president s urging , it would be hard to move forward on the treaty given the senate s already crowded agenda , as well as a continuing democratic reluctance to engage in a politically charged debate over guns the said thursday that it would continue to vigorously oppose any international effort to restrict the constitutional rights of lawabiding american gun owners since taking office , mr obama and his aides have been working assiduously to carve out a mexico policy that talks of shared responsibility in combating the drug problem on wednesday , the obama administration announced stiff financial sanctions against members of three more mexican drug cartels , designating them kingpins under a law that allows the american government to seize their assets in words that resounded on both sides of the border , secretary of state hillary rodham clinton that america s insatiable demand for illegal drugs fueled the trade and that america s inability to stop weapons from being smuggled south fed the violence it is a marked shift in tone from previous administrations , and mr obama used his visit here to reiterate the sentiment i will not pretend that this is mexico s responsibility alone , he said the demand for these drugs inside the united states is keeping these cartels in business as if to underscore his point , the mexican authorities reported thursday that at least 15 drug cartel gunmen had been killed in a gun battle with army troops one soldier was also reported killed in the clash , which took place in san miguel totolapan , about 125 miles southwest of mexico city for the last 30 years the united states has come down with the big sticks of eradication and helicopters , and the elephant in the room of our own consumption , and the tough proliferation of arms , were just never addressed , said julia e sweig , director of the latin america program at the council on foreign relations i think just beginning to talk about those things is going to buy him a lot of space down there mr obama comes here fresh from a muchpublicized swing through europe that put him squarely on the world stage the latin america trip may not have as high a profile but the president has made repairing relations with world leaders a signature of his foreign policy , and the visit is intended to give him a chance to do that in a region with which he is less familiar mr obama was scheduled to leave friday morning for port of spain , trinidad , to attend a gathering of leaders of western hemisphere nations cuba is likely to be high on the agenda there the white house announced this week that mr obama was lifting longstanding restrictions on travel and remittances to the island , but some latin american leaders would like to see the united states lift its trade embargo with cuba mr obama said thursday that he had made a good faith effort to improve relations and was now looking for cuba to demonstrate its willingness to make democratic reforms a relationship that has been frozen for 50 years , he said , 'is not going to thaw overnight
lindsey hoshaw , a freelance journalist in palo alto , calif , hopes to sell a multimedia slide show and maybe an article to the times about the , a mass of floating plastic trash caught in swirling currents in a stretch of ocean twice the size of texas but first , she has to get there to help finance a 10 , 000 reporting trip aboard a research vessel , hoshaw has turned to , a web site where reporters appeal for donations to pay for their projects if she can raise 6 , 000 before the september departure date so far , only about 1 , 600 has come in she will take out a loan for the rest , she said the times has told hoshaw that it might pay about 700 for the pictures , more if it also buys a story to some , this is exploitation the mighty new york times forcing a struggling journalist to beg with a virtual tin cup but hoshaw does not think so to her , it is an opportunity she cannot pass up a story she has long dreamed of , and a chance for a byline in the times to , the founder of the nonprofit spotus , it is a way for the public to commission journalism that it wants for the times , it is another step into a new world unthinkable even a few years ago as newspaper and technology drastically changes the public s relationship with news organizations , the times is searching for new streams of money and opening itself to partnerships and arrangements far from the old model , in which editors decide what news is , assign their own reporters and pay the expenses all of it supported by hundreds and hundreds of advertisers , none big enough to influence the journalism in any way the new relationships come in many shapes and sizes the times let hoshaw use its name in her fundraising pitch it has published stories in partnership with , a nonprofit investigative reporting unit founded by billionaire bankers times executives and editors have even discussed seeking foundation support to underwrite sections of the paper or categories of news , like science times , though , the company s spokeswoman , said no foundations had been approached along with the opportunity to preserve and strengthen the times , every step into this new world presents potential pitfalls witness the when the washington post solicited lobbyists for 25 , 000 to 250 , 000 to sponsor offtherecord salons where they could schmooze with government officials and post journalists at the publisher s home after that , , the executive editor of the times , said he had asked , the standards editor , to inventory every initiative at the times that might pose ethical problems whitney approved hoshaw s spotus after meeting with cohn , the founder , and satisfying himself that there were safeguards against special interests hijacking a story most contributors give around 20 , and all are named \( i'm rooting for hoshaw and am kicking in , too \) hoshaw dismissed online suggestions that the times had assigned her the story but told her to pay for getting it instead , she told me , she had talked about her interest in the garbage patch while interviewing for an internship at the paper and wound up pitching the story as a freelance project to , the science editor chang told her that she did not normally pay travel expenses to freelancers and that the paper had a bit about the subject times policy , whitney said , is to pay expenses for freelance work it assigns , not for what comes in unsolicited hoshaw is just starting out and is unproven to the times , but another new relationship has deeper roots and deeper pockets the paper s partnership with propublica developed because keller and other times editors had long experience with , paul steiger and stephen engelberg steiger was the managing editor of the wall street journal for 16 years , and engelberg was once the investigative editor at the times , managing editor for news at the times , is on of propublica the partnership has produced two big stories in the times of failures in american reconstruction efforts in iraq , and a about how siemens , the german engineering firm , paid millions of dollars in bribes around the world the times and propublica are working on a third project that is expected to take up a full issue of the sunday magazine next month propublica was founded by herbert and marion sandler of san francisco , who made their fortune in the mortgage lending business and exited it just before the real estate crash the sandlers are wellknown for supporting liberal causes and democratic candidates , but steiger , who said he worked for conservative publishers at the journal and did n't let that influence his news judgment , has received written guarantees of independence he said herbert sandler and the other directors did not even know what his journalists were working on sandler told me that he had suggested several stories , but none had been produced the sandlers have an awkward relationship with the times , but that apparently has not interfered with the journalism collaboration last december , the paper published that said the type of mortgage the sandlers specialized in had become the typhoid mary of the industry the sandlers objected to the article four corrections have been published and still say it was an unfair and inaccurate characterization of their business practices propublica has also with major news organizations to produce impressive journalism with no discernable political slant with cbs last week highlighted questionable federal stimulus spending on airports and i think it has proved its value and independence but in the interest of transparency , the times owes readers a full explanation of the relationship when it publishes a joint project who is in editorial control \? the times says it is where does the money come from \? propublica just received a threeyear grant from the to help it build a sustainable business model and reduce its reliance on the sandlers , who are taking the lead in the effort to find more diverse financing the foundation , which supports an array of journalism efforts , also financed the launch of spotus , the site hoshaw is using to round up backers for her freelance trip to the pacific alberto ibarg en , the foundation s president , said that unless traditional news organizations move from i write and you read to partnerships and letting the public participate in shaping the news , i think the world will pass them by
minneapolis the carlson school of management rises from the asphalt like a monument to capitalist ambition stock prices race across an electronic ticker near a sleek entrance and the atrium soars skyward , as if lifting the aspirations of its students the school s plucky motto is nowhere but here for a group of students who often met at the school , on the university of minnesota campus , those words seemed especially fitting they had fled somalia as small boys , escaping a catastrophic civil war they came of age as refugees in minneapolis , embracing basketball and the prom , hiphop and the mall of america by the time they reached college , their dreams seemed within grasp one planned to become a doctor another , an entrepreneur but last year , in a study room on the first floor of carlson , the men turned their energies to a different enterprise why are we sitting around in america , doing nothing for our people \? one of the men , mohamoud hassan , a skinny 23yearold engineering major , pressed his friends in november , mr hassan and two other students dropped out of college and left for somalia , the homeland they barely knew word soon spread that they had joined the , a militant islamist group aligned with that is fighting to overthrow the fragile somali government the students are among more than 20 young americans who are the focus of what may be the most significant domestic terrorism investigation since sept 11 one of the men , shirwa ahmed , blew himself up in somalia in october , becoming the first known american suicide bomber the director of the federal bureau of investigation , robert m mueller , has said mr ahmed was radicalized in his hometown in minnesota an examination by the new york times , based on interviews with close friends and relatives of the men , law enforcement officials and lawyers , as well as access to live phone calls and facebook messages between the men and their friends in the united states , reveals how a farflung jihadist movement found a foothold in america s heartland the men appear to have been motivated by a complex mix of politics and faith , and their communications show how some are trying to recruit other young americans to their cause the case represents the largest group of american citizens suspected of joining an extremist movement affiliated with al qaeda although friends say the men have never thought of carrying out attacks in the united states , fbi officials worry that with their training , ideology and american passports , there is a real danger that they could this case is unlike anything we have encountered , said ralph s boelter , the special agent in charge of the fbi s minneapolis office , which is leading the investigation most of the men are somali refugees who left the twin cities of minneapolis and st paul in two waves , starting in late 2007 while religious devotion may have predisposed them to sympathize with the islamist cause in somalia , it took a major geopolitical event the ethiopian invasion of their homeland in 2006 to spur them to join what they saw as a legitimate resistance movement , said friends of the men for many of the men , the path to somalia offered something personal as well a sense of adventure , purpose and even renewal in the first wave of somalis who left were men whose uprooted lives resembled those of immigrants in europe who have joined the jihad they faced barriers of race and class , religion and language mr ahmed , the 26yearold suicide bomber , struggled at community colleges before dropping out his friend zakaria maruf , 30 , fell in with a violent street gang and later stocked shelves at a walmart if failure had shadowed this first group of men , the young minnesotans who followed them to somalia were succeeding in america mr hassan , the engineering student , was a rising star in his college community another of the men was a premed student who had once set his sights on an internship at the mayo clinic they did not leave the united states for a lack of opportunity , their friends said if anything , they seemed driven by unfulfilled ambition now they feel important , said one friend , who remains in contact with the men and , like others , would only speak anonymously because of the investigation the case has forced federal agents and terrorism analysts to rethink some of their most basic assumptions about the vulnerability of muslim immigrants in the united states to the lure of militant islam for years , it seemed that homegrown terrorism was largely a problem in european countries like britain and france , where muslim immigrants had failed to prosper economically or integrate culturally by contrast , experts believed that the successful assimilation of foreignborn muslims in the united states had largely immunized them from the appeal of radical ideologies the story of the twin cities men does not lend itself to facile categorizations they make up a minuscule percentage of their somaliamerican community , and it is unclear whether their transformation reflects any broader trend nor are they especially representative of the wider muslim immigrant population , which has enjoyed a stable and largely middleclass existence even among the world s jihadists , the young men from minneapolis are something of an exception in their instant messages and cellphone calls , they seem caught between innercity america and the badlands of africa , pining for starbucks one day , extolling the virtues of camel s milk and islamic fundamentalism the next allah will never change the situation of a people unless they change themselves , mr hassan , the engineering student , wrote in a facebook message he posted on april 15 take a sec and think about your situation deeply what change do you need to make \? shirwa ahmed climbed the worn , concrete steps of roosevelt high school on his first day as a freshman in september 1996 a slim boy with a watchful gaze , he was one of hundreds of somali teenagers who had landed at the school in southeastern minneapolis some had never seen a drinking fountain others did not know how to hold a pencil , recalled the school s principal , bruce gilman they carried unspeakable traumas a number of the students had witnessed their parents being killed it s almost unimaginable what some of these kids went through , mr gilman said the country they had fled , on the eastern tip of africa , was embroiled in a civil war that had left it without a functioning government since 1991 the anarchy reached american televisions two years later , when warlords shot down two black hawk helicopters , killing 18 united states soldiers by then , tens of thousands of somalis had died and a mass exodus had begun a generation of somalis grew up in the overcrowded refugee camps of northern kenya , where malaria , scorpion infestations and hunger took their toll tales of america sustained them clean water was said to flow freely in kitchens , and simple jobs like plucking chickens paid handsomely proof came in the cash sent by a first wave of refugees who had arrived in the united states in the early 1990s minneapolis , with its robust social services and steady supply of unskilled jobs , quickly became the capital of their north american diaspora when they ended their shifts as cabdrivers or janitors , many somalis retreated from american life they had transformed a blighted stretch near the mississippi river into a little mogadishu , commandeering a grim collection of cinderblock buildings known as the towers a onetime fictional residence of the heroine of the mary tyler moore show they cut their hair at somali barber shops , prayed at somali mosques and organized themselves along the same clan lines that had divided them for decades , calling on tribal elders to settle family disputes and community rifts if the adults kept their distance from american culture , their children had little choice but to dive in at roosevelt , mr ahmed was a quick study he memorized ice cube s lyrics he practiced for hours on neighborhood basketball courts he took note of the clothing and vernacular of his africanamerican classmates , emulating what he could his pants sagged , but never too much he spoke of homeboys and used the n word , but gave careful regard to the school s rules when a classmate s purse was stolen , it was mr ahmed who dutifully turned in the thief much as he tried , he failed to fit in his peers taunted somali and africanamerican students clashed frequently at the school , but mr ahmed seemed illsuited to the fight taciturn by nature , he recoiled at the taunts , his close friend nicole hartford said how can they be mad at me for looking like them \? she recalled him saying we 're from the same place even as mr ahmed met rejection at school , he faced disapproval from relatives , who complained that he was mixing with ghetto people , ms hartford recalled it was a classic conundrum for young somalis how to be one thing at school and another at home developments in the homeland , followed obsessively by the adults , held little interest among teenagers they rolled their eyes at the older men known as the sitting warriors , who debated clan politics with such gusto at one starbucks that the staff bought a decibel meter to ensure that the noise did not rise above legal limits yet young men like mr ahmed remained tethered to somalia by the remittances they were pressed to send after school every day , he joined a stream of teenagers headed for the airport , where he pushed passengers in wheelchairs he sent half of his income to somalia , to relatives we do n't even know , his friend nimco ahmed said the war had torn families apart , and fathers were in short supply somali boys struggled most visibly the financial strain on families like mr ahmed s , which was headed by an older sister , proved staggering of the estimated 100 , 000 somalis in the united states , more than 60 percent live in poverty , according to recent census data after graduating from high school in 2000 , mr ahmed seemed to flounder , taking community college classes while working odd jobs , friends said but he had done better than many peers , who turned to crime and gangs like murda squad and rough tough somalis at the root of the problem was a crisis of belonging , said mohamud galony , a science tutor who was friends with mr ahmed and is the uncle of another boy who left young somalis had been raised to honor their families' tribes , yet felt disconnected from them they want to belong , but who do they belong to \? said mr galony , 23 by 2004 , mr ahmed had found a new circle of friends these religious young men , pegged as bornagains or fundis , set themselves apart by their dress their trousers had gone from sagging to short , emulating the prophet muhammad , who was said to have kept his clothes from touching the ground perhaps none of mr ahmed s contemporaries had undergone a transformation like that of zakaria maruf a short boy prone to fits of rage , mr maruf began at the age of 14 for a time , he fell in with the hot boyz , a violent street gang he seemed to crave recognition known on the basketball court as zak , he was a mediocre athlete , but he pushed himself harder than anyone else , recalled his coach , ahmed dahir mr maruf threw himself into islam with the same intensity , becoming a fixture at a mosque near the towers , where he mastered the call to prayer he had an ego the size of minnesota , one fellow mosque member said it was , look at me' mr ahmed and mr maruf were sometimes seen preaching to kids on the street , offering their own lives as examples of reform yet they continued to struggle mr maruf s criminal record had foiled his search for a job when he proposed to a young woman in 2005 , her parents scoffed , one friend recalled they did not want their daughter winding up on welfare , they told mr maruf , who worked at a walmart they think that life is about money and material things , but watch what that will do for them , mr maruf told the friend one afternoon , sitting slumped at the mosque he seemed to be searching for a clean slate both he and mr ahmed would find it thousands of miles away in 2006 , an islamist movement swept through somalia and seized control , giving the country its first taste of peace in a generation the group , known as the islamic courts union , promised to end 15 years of internecine violence by uniting somalia s clans under the banner of islam key ports were reopened , and order was restored to the capital , mogadishu in washington , officials of the bush administration saw a threat to east african stability hardline factions of the courts were thought to be sheltering qaeda operatives and had declared a jihad against neighboring ethiopia , a predominantly christian country in december 2006 , ethiopian troops crossed the border and routed the islamist forces with intelligence support from the united states , beginning a twoyear occupation these events triggered a political awakening among young somalis in minneapolis they had long viewed their homeland s problems as hopelessly clanbased , but the ethiopian campaign simplified things here was an external enemy against which young somalis could unite spurred by a newfound sense of nationalism , college students distributed tshirts emblazoned with the somali flag and held demonstrations during a frigid minnesota winter the protests took on a religious dimension as well while the united states had defended the ethiopian invasion as a front in the global war on terrorism , many somalis saw it as a christian crusade into a muslim land they were outraged at reports of ethiopian troops raping somali women , looting mosques and killing civilians if the ethiopians were seen as infidel invaders , an insurgent group known as youth , in arabic was emerging as freedom fighters in its online propaganda , the shabaab conflated nationalist sentiments with religious ideology , following a tactic honed by al qaeda the shabaab began releasing videos portraying somalia s struggle as part of a global movement to defend islam and restore its rule foreign recruits were promised victory or martyrdom for enlisting several american converts to islam joined up the recruitment of the twin cities men can be traced to a group of somali immigrants from northern europe and other countries who , in 2005 , traveled to somalia to fight with the islamist movement , a senior law enforcement official said a handful of those men later went to minneapolis , the official said , and helped persuade the first large group from the twin cities to leave for somalia starting in late 2007 that first wave consisted of men in their 20s and 30s who had been fixtures at the abubakar assaddique islamic center , the largest somali mosque in minneapolis they included an emergency medical technician , a former waiter , a carrental employee and shirwa ahmed , the onetime roosevelt student who now wore a thick beard and silk gown that fall , mr ahmed announced to friends that he was moving to the middle east to study islam after he left for saudi arabia to make hajj , the obligatory pilgrimage to mecca , his nephew wrote to a friend , my uncle is a changed man the following spring , zakaria maruf , the former gang member , vanished shortly after his disappearance , two teenage boys walked into a travel agency near the towers , clutching their somali passports , recalled abia ali , an accountant at the agency ms ali recognized the boys from the mosque and suspected that they planned to follow mr maruf to somalia she warned the mosque s leaders , who alerted the boys' parents and then summoned a meeting with the mosque s young members all this talk of the movement must stop , the imam , sheikh abdirahman sheikh omar ahmed , recalled telling the crowd focus on your life here if you become a doctor or an engineer , you can help your country over there you will be a dead body on the street in the audience were several young men who would soon disappear if the first men who left for somalia had struggled to find their place in america , the boys to follow were our best kids , in the words of one uncle mohamoud hassan outdid most of his peers at roosevelt high school in 2006 , becoming one of the few somali boys to make it to college that year he stood out at the university of minnesota answering to the nickname snake , the tall , lanky freshman wore a black cotton beret and a pencilthin moustache women found him clownishly charming , occasionally giving in to his pleas for their digits the engineering major tried to cultivate a more serious image , writing poetry , debating politics and poring through the autobiography of malcolm x , his friend hindia ali recalled even his closest friends found mr hassan an enigma he had come to the united states without parents or siblings and looked after his ailing grandmother in a dim apartment in the towers he longed to return to his homeland , both to experience it for himself and to rebuild it it was a common obsession among his friends it s just this missing piece of us , his friend ruqia mohamed said after the ethiopian invasion , a circle of listeners sometimes gathered around mr hassan at the coffman student center mr hassan , then the vice president of the minnesota somali student union , defended the occupation , posting an essay on facebook assailing the insurgents as a handful of thugs but over time , he began to see things differently mr hassan s interest in the islamist movement dovetailed with his own religious transformation , friends said in the fall of 2007 he began downloading sermons onto his ipod and soon was attending the abubakar mosque by then , mr hassan had become upset by the reports of rapes in somalia and set out to learn more about the insurgency , one friend recalled he began talking of joining the movement as early as february 2008 , around the same time that a friend from the mosque mr maruf , the former gang member left for somalia i wanted to go , so i got to know him , mr hassan said in a recent telephone conversation from somalia with a minneapolis friend that may , he was incensed by a united states military air strike that killed aden hashi ayro , a leader of the shabaab , along with at least 10 civilians how dare they \? mr hassan demanded one afternoon at the student center who is the terrorist \? mr hassan and another university student searched the internet for jihadist videos and chat rooms , the friend said they listened to constants on the path to jihad , lectures by the yemeni cleric , who is suspected of inciting muslims in the west to violence while somali nationalism had initially driven the men , a friend said , their cause eventually took on a religious cast they became convinced that somalia s years of bloodshed were punishment from god for straying from islam , the friend said the answer was to restore the caliphate , or islamic rule they saw it as their duty to go and fight , the friend said if it was just nationalism , they could give money but religion convinced them to sacrifice their whole life over the next few months , the men communicated frequently with zakaria maruf , who was then in southern somalia trying to recruit men in minneapolis to join him , said a senior law enforcement official and a lawyer , stephen l smith , who represents one of the men mr maruf approached mr maruf reached out through listservs and conference calls arranged by a teenage boy who distributed 800 numbers and passwords so people could listen in had little trouble finding an audience for his pitch in the twin cities he had shuttled boys from the abubakar mosque to basketball games , and a recording of his call to prayer was a ring tone on the cellphones of young somalis in his calls , listeners heard him boast that he had gotten married , had a child and become a governor for the shabaab the onetime stock boy with a criminal record was now a figure of authority , if one believed his claims he was the i 'll take you to the battlefield' person , one acquaintance said despite all the spirited talk of the jihad , mohamoud hassan , the engineering student , seemed to waver , friends recalled the tipping point , one said , may have come that september when a close friend was shot dead outside a youth center the fifth slaying of a young somali in the twin cities in a year i used to think that death only happens to old people , mr hassan told his friend ruqia mohamed but he was young my age i guess i could die tomorrow mr hassan began spending much of his time with a small group of men that included a premed student , an electrical engineering student , a white and a pesky 17yearold roosevelt senior the boy , known as little bashir , had memorized the koran and talked of going to harvard the men acted secretive , friends recalled , meeting alone in a study room at the carlson building , where mr hassan and the premed student worked as uniformed security personnel in late october , the group visited university travel services , near the towers , accompanied by an older man with a gray beard who introduced himself as their uncle , the manager of the agency said in an interview the uncle explained that the men wanted to buy tickets to somalia , and were waiting for passports soon after , the young men returned by themselves and paid cash for their tickets , roughly 1 , 800 apiece , the manager said they to avoid drawing attention , a friend said mr hassan drove to chicago , where he boarded a plane to dubai on nov 1 , according to an itinerary obtained by the times by the eve of the united states presidential election three days later , all of the men were gone as word spread in minneapolis that a new group of men had disappeared , another piece of jarring news came from somalia shirwa ahmed had blown himself up on oct 29 , 2008 , he drove a car packed with explosives into a government compound in puntland , a region of northern somalia the bombing was among five attacks that day coordinated by the shabaab , which left more than 20 people dead in the group s campaign to eliminate enemies and show their might the fbi investigated and sent mr ahmed s remains to minneapolis in november by then , mr hassan and his friends were journeying in the opposite direction a close friend said the men were met by zakaria maruf , the recruiter , and taken to the southern port city of merka , where they stayed in a welcoming house run by a somali woman whom the men called mama by january , most of the men were at a training camp in southern somalia , following a strict routine that mr hassan and others described to their minneapolis friends in phone calls they woke before dawn to pray and study the koran they engaged in rigorous training , running obstacle courses and learning to make bombs as foreign recruits , they received special treatment these mujahideen slept in a different bunker and were considered to have a higher status , the friend said mr hassan was struck by the diversity of the fighters , who included chechnyans and converts from europe i am looking out into the field and i see so many different colors , mr hassan told the friend by phone if becoming a jihadist usually means parting with life in the west , the men from minneapolis soon broke with tradition they frequently communicated with dozens of friends in the united states whom one acquaintance described as the homeys they left behind two friends showed the times the facebook communications of four of the men , including one whose profile picture was , until recently , of osama bin laden one exchange on facebook distilled the push and pull sup dawg , one of the men wrote to a friend in late december bring yourself over here to mtown , the message continued , where the men carry all types of guns i ai n't goin' over there man , the young man answered dats the same reason we came 2 america locco mr hassan and the others claimed to be enjoying their adventure they had grown up hearing tales about the winding shabelle river in southern somalia and the rich taste of camel milk when they finally swam in the river and drank the milk , they called their friends in minneapolis , their voices dreamy the men seemed to revel in their new identity as fighters one day in march , mr hassan s friend the premed student was talking on the phone with someone in minneapolis when he opened fire with his ak47 he was checking to see if it worked , the person recalled him saying but there were cracks in the men s bravado while on a boat headed to a shabaab stronghold in the south , the high school student known as little bashir began vomiting so violently that he lost his glasses , his mother said in an interview after he told her this by phone , she fetched his prescription and read it to him , hoping he would somehow find an optometrist it was hard to imagine this 17yearold a frail , bookish boy who had delighted in calculus making his way through warravaged somalia , friends of his said i doubt that he could even pick up a handgun , said mr galony , who had tutored the boy in chemistry if the others seemed hardier , they still had moments of weakness they missed movies and basketball , deodorant and boxer shorts , they told friends back home one of the men , who suffered from heartburn , asked if anyone could send him a box of tums by dhl their longing for life in america came and went they encountered more serious challenges in somalia by the time some of them entered training , the shabaab was fast losing popularity the ethiopian troops had pulled out , making way for a new somali president , sheik sharif sheik ahmed , the same man who had once led the islamist movement to which the shabaab formerly belonged some of them wondered who they were fighting , one friend said the jihadists' conversations with their minneapolis friends sometimes turned testy two of the friends said in interviews that they , like many somalis , had become sharply critical of the shabaab the group has carried out beheadings , amputations and the fatal stoning of a 13yearold rape victim in april , the shabaab fired several mortar rounds at a plane carrying representative donald m payne , a new jersey democrat who was leaving somalia after meeting with the president what , are y'all retarded \? one of mr maruf s friends , a college student , chided him in a phone call he s our only friend in congress you have been brainwashed by the media , mr maruf shot back later , the student thought back on the conversation sometimes they will talk and you 're like , are you trying to prove this to me or to yourself \? she said they have this inner struggle ralph s boelter had a robust r sum by the time he took over the fbi s minneapolis office in early 2007 he had worked on whitecollar crimes in boston and violent gangs in los angeles he had investigated the leak of the cia officer valerie wilson s identity returning to the midwest put mr boelter , a squarejawed wisconsin native , back on familiar ground but less than two years later , he found himself tasked with one of the most complex terrorism cases since sept 11 never did i imagine that i would step into this here , mr boelter said one recent afternoon in the years since the sept 11 attacks , somalis had remained largely under the law enforcement radar while other muslim immigrants primarily arabs and south asians experienced the brunt of the raids and scrutiny while federal investigators had tracked the movements of american recruits to the shabaab since at least early 2008 , the fbi s case did not swing into high gear until after shirwa ahmed s suicide attack that fall investigators in minneapolis approached somalis on the street , in their homes , at the abubakar mosque and on the university of minnesota campus brandishing photographs , the agents asked questions about community figures like the imam of the mosque and its youth director as the inquiry wore on , community leaders say , more than 50 people were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in minneapolis and another jury was convened in san diego in april , fbi agents raided three somali money wiring businesses in minneapolis by then , the investigation had expanded to smaller somali communities in boston seattle portland , me and columbus , ohio somalis in minneapolis , by turns frightened and intrigued by the inquiry , came up with a somali code name for the fbi agents in their midst fadumo bashir ismael mr boelter tried to counter the negative attention by appearing on somali television and radio , encouraging people to cooperate with investigators yet he has revealed little about the case itself the scope and intensity of the investigation , he said , is merely commensurate to the danger posed by the men if american citizens are joining the shabaab , the potential threat domestically is serious , mr boelter said i think they could be commissioned to come back or they could do it on their own because they are philosophically aligned with the shabaab or al qaeda senior qaeda leaders have aggressively promoted somalia as the latest destination for foreign fighters , said evan kohlmann , a terrorism consultant who frequently works for the government in recent months , a small number of qaeda operatives have reportedly sought sanctuary there analysts find the alliance troubling because al qaeda has long sought recruits with american and european passports who can cross borders more freely , said bruce hoffman , a professor at georgetown university who studies terrorism there are indications that three twin cities men have returned , possibly after defecting from the shabaab a friend of the men still in somalia said they had no thought of attacking america why would i do that \? the friend recalled the premed student , adbisalan ali , saying on the phone last spring my mom could be walking down the street the central question driving the fbi investigation is whether united states citizens have provided material support to the shabaab , either in the form of personnel or money three local acquaintances of mr maruf , the recruiter , sent him small amounts of money at his request , according to one of the friends and a lawyer for the others it is not known how the young men who followed him to somalia paid for their trips two of the teenage boys were seen knocking on doors at the towers last summer , asking for donations for an orphanage the full dimensions of the recruitment effort also remain unclear a close friend of several of the men described the process as a chain of friendship in which one group encouraged the next they want to bring people they are close with because they need that familiarity , the friend said they created their own little america in somalia the manager of university travel services said that since november , he had turned away at least 20 men looking to buy tickets to somalia , adding that the requests had slowed considerably meanwhile , some somali parents in the twin cities have taken to hiding their sons' passports the tension in the community has turned inward at times last march , the uncle of burhan hassan , the boy known as little bashir , testified at a on the case that the mosque had been brainwashing the young men and had possibly raised money for the shabaab the mosque s leaders denied this , in turn accusing the family and others of shirking responsibility for their own children that s their obligation , to know where their kids are going , said omar hurre , the mosque s executive director for many older somalis in minnesota , the deepest mystery is why so many young refugees would risk their lives and futures to return to a country that their parents struggled to leave the mother of burhan hassan had been trying to persuade him to escape to the united states embassy in nairobi , kenya , said the uncle , osman ahmed the boy had been calling from somalia , telling her that he was fine and that he missed her cooking there is no future for me in america anymore , she recalled him telling her if i come back they 'll send me to guant namo but he finally agreed to leave , and in late may his mother wired him about 800 , mr ahmed said ten days later , on june 5 , she picked up the telephone to learn that her son was dead he had been shot in the head , a stranger on the phone told mr hassan s mother some of the boy s relatives suspect that he was killed to prevent him from cooperating with the american investigation fbi officials have declined to confirm mr hassan s death months have passed since the older members of his group completed their training in somalia lately , they seem hardened and at times radical , a minneapolis friend said during one call , the friend asked mohamoud hassan , the engineering student , what it was like to kill people he told of getting an adrenaline rush , the friend recalled , and joked that he and his friends compared body counts two weeks ago , they spoke again and the conversation turned to the killing of little bashir one of the men had referred to his passing as martyrdom in a recent facebook posting mr hassan seemed to agree allah knows how to pick , he said the family s feeling sad , but we 're feeling happy for him
washington is khalid sheikh mohammed coming to a prison near you \? one day after president obama ordered that the military detention center at , cuba , be shuttered , lawmakers in washington wrestled with the implications of bringing dozens of the 245 remaining inmates onto american soil republican lawmakers , who oppose mr obama s plan , found a talking point with political appeal they said closing guant namo could allow dangerous terrorists to get off on legal technicalities and be released into quiet neighborhoods across the united states if the detainees were convicted , the republicans continued , american prisons housing terrorism suspects could become magnets for attacks meanwhile , none of the democrats who on thursday hailed the closing of the detention camp were stepping forward to offer prisons in their districts or states to receive the prisoners senator christopher s bond , republican of missouri and vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee , taunted the chairwoman , dianne feinstein , democrat of california , by suggesting that the authorities reopen alcatraz prison in the san francisco bay on friday , a spokesman for mrs feinstein countered that alcatraz now was a national park and tourist attraction , not a functioning prison , and that the senator does not consider it a suitable place to house detainees but mrs feinstein does believe that some guant namo prisoners could be moved to maximumsecurity civilian or military prisons in the united states , the spokesman said , not naming any specific ones senator carl levin , democrat of michigan and the chairman of the senate armed services committee , said in response to a question on friday that guant namo detainees who were moved to the united states should be held at maximumsecurity federal facilities wherever they are available like other democrats queried friday , mr levin did not specifically address the question of prisoners moving to his state one of the first democrats in congress to address the notinmybackyard issue directly was representative john p murtha of pennsylvania , who told reporters this week that terrorism suspects would be no more dangerous in a secure pennsylvania prison than they were in cuba there are thousands of dangerous prisoners being held securely behind bars in supermax prisons across the united states , mr murtha said friday he noted , however , that there was no supermax facility in his district the number of detainees who may face federal trials by various estimates , 50 to 100 of the remaining guant namo inmates is tiny by the standards of the federal prison system , which currently holds 201 , 375 people in 114 facilities , according to felicia ponce , a spokeswoman for the federal bureau of prisons those include 9 detention centers that hold defendants awaiting trial , 21 highsecurity penitentiaries and a supersecure prison in florence , colo , where several convicted terrorists are already locked up obama administration officials are beginning to review the files on the remaining detainees at guant namo to decide where they should go some have been judged not dangerous and cleared for release , but officials have not found a country to take them others , including mr mohammed , the chief planner of the sept 11 terrorist attacks , will almost certainly face trial , either in a federal or a military court but incoming administration officials admit that every option is imperfect there are n't pretty choices for what we have to do with them , dennis c blair , the nominee for director of national intelligence , told senators on thursday republican lawmakers have watched these struggles with a certain relish representative peter hoekstra of michigan , the senior republican on the house intelligence committee , said , as people start getting an indication that they 're going to kansas , that they 're going to california , that they 're going to illinois or to michigan , people are going to say , no , why would we want them here and put them in a general prison population and make our hometowns a target for terrorists \? ' despite speculation about the possibility of moving large numbers of detainees to a single military jail , like those in leavenworth , kan , or charleston , sc , government officials and legal experts say it is more likely that inmates would be sent to civilian or military facilities across the country that would reduce the burden on any single location and make each site less of a potential terrorist target sarah e mendelson , a scholar at the center for strategic and international studies who led a study of options for closing guant namo , said it would be best if detainees facing prosecution were indicted while still at guant namo and then moved into federal pretrial facilities in the united states , which routinely house people accused of murder and other dangerous inmates we 've had extremely dangerous terrorists tried in various courts and put away , ms mendelson said federal courts have convicted 145 people on terrorismrelated charges since 2001 , according to one review , while the at guant namo have been plagued with delays and legal setbacks the obama administration has to have a little more of a conversation with the american people about the feasibility of prosecuting terrorism suspects in the united states , she said there are plenty of americans who would want to see some of these guys prosecuted and locked up
washington as the most ambitious energy and climatechange legislation ever introduced in congress made its way to a floor vote last friday , it grew fat with compromises , carveouts , concessions and outandout gifts intended to win the votes of wavering lawmakers and the support of powerful industries the deal making continued right up until the final minutes , with the bill s coauthor representative , democrat of california , doling out billions of dollars in promises on the house floor to secure the final votes needed for passage the bill was freighted with hundreds of pages of specialinterest favors , even as environmentalists lamented that its greenhousegas reduction targets had been whittled down some of the prizes were relatively small , like the 50 million hurricane research center for a freshman lawmaker from florida others were huge and threatened to undermine the environmental goals of the bill , like a series of compromises reached with rural and farmstate members that would funnel billions of dollars in payments to agriculture and forestry interests automakers , steel companies , natural gas drillers , refiners , universities and real estate agents all got in on the fastmoving action the biggest concessions went to utilities , which wanted assurances that they could continue to operate and build burning power plants without shouldering new costs the utilities received not only tens of billions of dollars worth of free pollution permits , but also billions for work on technology to capture carbondioxide emissions from coal combustion to help meet future pollution targets that deal , negotiated by representative rick boucher , a conservative democrat from virginia s coal country , won the support of the edison electric institute , the utility industry lobby , and lawmakers from regions dependent on coal for electricity liberal democrats got a piece , too representative bobby rush , democrat of illinois , withheld his support for the bill until a lastminute accord was struck to provide nearly 1 billion for energyrelated jobs and job training for lowincome workers and new subsidies for making public housing more energyefficient representative joe barton , a texas republican staunchly opposed to the bill , marveled at the dealcutting on friday it is unprecedented , mr barton said , but at least it s transparent mr waxman defended the deal making as necessary to address a problem that affected every region and every industry we worked hard to craft compromises that addressed the legitimate concerns of industry without undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation , mr waxman said tackling hard issues that have been ignored for years is never easy in its odyssey from introduction in late march to house passage , the climatechange bill sponsored by mr waxman and representative edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , grew to more than 1 , 400 pages from 648 pages although watered down from the original vision , it was still the first time either house of congress passed a bill imposing a limit on the emissions blamed for the warming of the planet the legislation awaits action in the senate despite all the concessions , president obama worked hard for the bill and called it an extraordinary step for the nation he said in an interview sunday that the compromises had been necessary to moderate the different effects of greenhousegas controls on different parts of the country i think that finding the right balance between providing new incentives to businesses , but not giving away the store , is always an art it s not a science because it s never precise , mr obama said one of the major changes in the bill came early at the insistence of democrats from southeastern states , including john barrow of georgia , g k butterfield of north carolina and bart gordon of tennessee prodded by utilities in the region , they pressed for a weakening of the national mandate for renewable energy the original bill called for all utilities to secure 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources like wind , solar , hydro and energy by 2025 this was seen as either impossible or enormously expensive in the southeast , which does not have abundant supplies of such energy the standard was weakened to 15 percent by 2020 , with states given the ability to reduce it further if they cannot meet the target that helped win mr gordon and mr butterfield s votes mr barrow voted no the bill s centerpiece is a program that sets a ceiling on emissions of heattrapping gases like carbon dioxide and allows polluting industries to trade emission permits or allowances to meet it mr obama said during the presidential campaign that all of those permits should be sold at auction , but the bill s authors ended up giving away 85 percent free at the outset of the program , which won votes but that some environmental advocates said undercut the bill s integrity industries fought among themselves for a share of the permits oil refiners were frozen out at the beginning , but called on lawmakers from refineryrich districts to press their case representative gene green , a democrat from near houston , demanded 5 percent of the permit value , worth more than 3 billion a year , to help refiners deal with the costs of carbon controls refineries are very energyintensive , mr green said they need a breather to adapt he got them 2 percent of the allowances the national rural electric cooperative association , a major supplier of power in the farm belt , was squeezed out by the big utilities and received none of the permits in the early negotiations but ultimately the head of the group , glenn english , a former democratic member of congress from oklahoma , secured nearly 400 million in annual emissions permits to help the small coops with that deal done , some farmstate democrats who had previously opposed the bill were willing to vote for it some of the toughest negotiations were between mr waxman and representative collin c peterson , democrat of minnesota and a fierce defender of agricultural interests mr peterson wrung numerous concessions on provisions opposed by agribusinesses and forestry companies several had to do with socalled offsets , which allow industrial polluters to meet emissions targets by buying carbon reductions from other sectors , particularly farms and forests , which actually take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in the original bill , those offsets were to have been regulated by the environmental protection agency , considered a bogyman in the farm states mr peterson got oversight shifted to the farmerfriendly department of agriculture he also broadened the list of activities that would qualify as offsets , bringing a potential windfall to farm interests his deal cut , mr peterson threw his support behind the bill rahm emanuel , the white house chief of staff and a former democratic leader in

with fall sports in full swing , concussions among student athletes are receiving more media attention than ever high school athletes sustained 137 , 000 concussions in the 20078 school year , according to a study from nationwide children s hospital in columbus , ohio many more almost certainly went unrecognized or ignored a few states , like new jersey and maine , are making preseason neurocognitive testing of players broadly available so that when a concussion happens there will be a baseline for comparison to determine when the player can return to sports should all schools make it a priority to test all athletes \? we asked some experts who work in this field and a student who was sidelined by concussions on the basketball court to tell us what s known and what isn t about managing this invisible injury , the president of the maine concussion management initiative , is the medical director and team physician at colby college in waterville , maine it s part of the game getting dinged , having one s bell rung , or getting hit so hard you see stars these phrases , commonly used to describe sportsrelated concussions , downplay the seriousness of these injuries the public s lack of understanding about these injuries has made it harder for doctors to educate patients and evaluate and manage sportsrelated concussions physicians often do not know when a concussed athlete could safely return to normal activity and , always in the back of the physician s mind is the knowledge that allowing a concussed athlete to return to play before full recovery carries the risk of prolonged concussionrelated symptoms or potentially catastrophic neurological injury over the years , the medical community has tried to grade the severity of sportsrelated concussions and establish appropriate treatment guidelines at one time no fewer than six concussion grading scales were available to physicians each varied subtly from the others none was evidencebased as a result , an injured athlete could see three different doctors and received three wholly different treatment plans that began to change in the late 1990s as researchers began using neurocognitive testing to evaluate and manage sportsrelated concussions the computerization of neurocognitive testing created an effective tool to help manage sportsrelated concussions by establishing a neurocognitive baseline for each athlete before any injury read more adoption of neurocognitive testing as a concussion management tool has not been universal there is an ongoing debate within the medical community challenging the accuracy and usefulness of neurocognitive testing in diagnosing and managing sportrelated concussion i believe baseline testing is critical for all athletes for two reasons one , it creates an opportunity to educate athletes on concussions and how to recognize symptoms early second , it will allow us to collect data to answer some of the lingering questions about the frequency of concussions and the role of neurocognitive testing here in maine , a group of us are working to make baseline testing available to all high school athletes at no cost \( neurocognitive testing is currently only available down to age 12 , but it should be initiated at junior high and middle schools , too \) the goal of the maine concussion management initiative , which is supported by grants from the goldfarb center for public affairs and civic engagement at colby college , is to offer testing in all high schools and to standardize how these injuries are managed is a sports medicine physician at hospital for special surgery in new york city and the author of the young athlete i was in my office last week when david , a 17yearold high school football player , came in with his parents david is a senior and has above average speed and receiving skills he s hoping to play college football next fall the complication he has had three concussions including one last year that kept him out of school for a week despite widespread and ever increasing information that is available on adolescent concussion , there still is remarkably little information that a physician can give an athlete like david why are some athletes prone to suffering concussions \? what makes their symptoms persist \? aside from stopping contact sports , what can be done to prevent these injuries \? defined as a traumatic event to the brain that causes an alteration in mental status , much information on concussion has been gleaned over the past 10 years in teen athletes , the data show cause for concern several studies have shown that the relative risk of suffering multiple concussions increases three to fivefold if an athlete has had one previously multiple concussions have been linked to memory problems and structural brain damage in studies involving adult football and rugby players and lastly , the healing rate of concussion is slower in adolescents than in adults read more neurocognitive testing , performed preseason to show an athlete s brain function , can be used as a baseline comparison if an athlete suffers an injury this kind of testing has been around for about 30 years more recently , computerized neurocognitive testing has become the norm in the sports world computerized testing started in the nfl and is used among all professional and most college football teams many high schools are using such testing as well this is especially prudent in the teen population since adolescents carry the highest risk of suffering second impact syndrome , a serious and sometimes fatal blow to the head while still recovering from a previous concussion the likelihood of allowing an injured athlete to go back prematurely into sport and risk a second impact is lessened with the use of more accurate , objective data from neurocognitive testing if david suffers another concussion , the computerized testing program will give a more exact determination of his brain function compared to his own baseline , and the decision to return him to competition can be made more scientifically do all athletes need a computerized baseline test \? in the teen population , there is not an exact answer if an athlete has never had a concussion , some argue that testing is overkill with football , soccer , and rugby , sports with the highest frequencies of concussion , testing all athletes seems to make sense any adolescent athlete who has suffered a concussion previously should probably be tested , regardless of sport , to ensure the safest return to activity should another concussion occur what about david \? should he risk another concussion \? is it worth playing football \? will it help him get into the college of his choice \? those aren t easy questions but with more information about concussion risks and preseason testing , he and his parents can be in a better position to make good decisions is a sophomore at the university of connecticut i think baseline testing makes sense for all sports i had to give up my passion , basketball , because of my concussions there s not a day that goes by when i don t think about playing watching other people play pickup basketball hurts me because i know that i can t do it anymore my entire childhood consisted of basketball it was who i was i received four concussions during my basketball career because of those concussions , i now have to be more cautious and aware of how i do everything i want studentathletes to know that concussions are a very serious matter numerous athletes have so much love for the game that they ll do anything to play but they need to realize that sitting out the next couple of games won t hurt them i know how hard it is to sit on the bench my high school basketball coach made sure i didn t play , and in the long run , i m thankful for that my teachers , however , did not understand the effects of concussions i remember having great difficulty doing my homework , something that usually came easy for me it was hard to concentrate in class and difficult to focus on the task at hand many teachers simply weren t aware of the symptoms i endured read more they didn t know that concussions can make you feel completely disoriented , like you re living in a dream you re just waiting to recover waiting to get your life back it takes a toll on you in the classroom , on the sports field , and in your life is a pediatric neuropsychologist and chief of the division of pediatric neuropsychology at children s national medical center he is a member of the 2008 international concussion in sport group consensus panel are there more concussions now than in previous generations \? this is difficult to answer it s clear , though , that our knowledge and awareness of concussions is increasing , which is likely to be responsible in part for an increase in diagnosis along with more awareness , baseline testing of student athletes has become a hot topic of discussion the general concept is a good one but the logistics of carrying it out can be hard for schools with certified athletic trainers and a consulting neuropsychologist , it is more manageable but for schools without these professionals and for afterschool youth sports leagues , properly administering and scheduling tests can be a significant challenge youth leagues \( recreational or on a more competitive travel \) and many high schools in the us \( approximately 60 percent \) typically do not have trained personnel to provide early recognition of injuries and baseline testing will offer no benefits if concussions are not recognized read more this is particularly troubling because there is some evidence that high school athletes take longer to recover from concussions than college and professional athletes more research needs to be done on why the brain of adolescents may respond differently to concussive forces than those of adults we also need to understand better how younger children recover there is another equally important , underrecognized problem overexerting \( overusing \) the brain while it is recovering from a concussion can have negative effects the most significant way a child uses his brain is school learning in fact , data from our research tells us that during the school year , 69 percent of studentathletes with concussions report significant worsening of symptoms \( cognitive exertional effect \) with cognitive learning activities like reading , complex math calculations , and writing interestingly , almost 90 percent of injured girls reported this effect in contrast , only 29 percent report worsening symptoms with physical activities , largely because we are better able to manage these activities in our clinic , even the toughest studentathletes report worsening of headaches , fatigue , concentration problems , and irritability when they try to concentrate on lectures , classwork or homework there is growing evidence that this cognitive overexertion may be associated with delayed recovery much of our time in clinic is spent developing treatment plans to help studentathletes reenter the classroom without significantly worsening their symptoms it is essential for schools and teachers to understand the underlying nature of the injury and the types of treatment , such as cognitive rest , that students need to recover more research on this issue and more teacher education would help is the head coach at buckingham , browne nichols school in cambridge , mass he has coached football for 32 years , including at harvard university , tufts university and bentley college in my seven years at buckingham , brown nichols school , we have always taken the concussion issue very seriously to start , every athlete in our school takes a baseline test \( testing reaction time , memory and attention span , among other factors \) prior to beginning their season this year , the students can take the test online , which takes approximately 30 minutes of uninterrupted time and can be taken from a home computer the test is free to the students and the cost is picked up by the school \( the cost to schools varies according to the number of students using it but we consider the price quite reasonable \) when a player is dinged on the field , he immediately sees a trainer and is given a repeat baseline test those results are compared to his preseason test if we suspect a problem , we refer our athletes to doctors who specialize in concussions from there , rehabilitation begins immediately if and when he is safe to return , the player , the parents and the coach know that he s 100 percent ready to resume playing as a head football coach and parent \( both of my sons play football nico at columbia university and dante at my school \) , i take tremendous comfort in knowing that our athletes are being carefully monitored for injuries that may be hard to see , but can be extremely serious
denver sixtyseven air force cadets have tested positive for and are being isolated at the in colorado springs , a spokesman for the academy said tuesday the outbreak is the single largest in colorado , which up until last week had 146 confirmed cases of the h1n1 virus , according to the state public health and environment department academy officials first became concerned last week when a growing number of incoming freshman cadets , who began basic training in june , started falling ill with flulike symptoms one hundred cadets have been isolated in a dormitory , and test results from an air force epidemiology laboratory in texas found that 67 had contracted swine flu results are still pending for dozens of cadets , said john van winkle , a spokesman for the academy seventy who fell ill were cleared to return to training none of the sick cadets have been hospitalized so far , and mr van winkle described all of the cases as moderate nonetheless , academy officials said they would not take any chances and called off the annual doolie day out , in which freshman cadets , who are known as doolies , are allowed to leave campus mr van winkle said it was nearly impossible to determine the source of the outbreak because some cadets had fanned out across the world for various air forcerelated programs there are 1 , 341 cadets in the incoming freshman class our priority right now is treating those that are ill , limiting the spread and educating our entire base population about what we have done and will continue to do , mr van winkle said joe quimby , a spokesman for the federal centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta , said the centers were working with the defense department to investigate the outbreak in colorado , which has seen a relatively low number of swine flu cases until now , a summer youth camp at the university of northern colorado in greeley was stopped after 10 students and three staff members exhibited flulike symptoms over the weekend there have been about 37 , 000 confirmed cases of swine flu so far in the united states and its territories earlier this month , the obama administration warned that the illness could resurge in the fall and announced plans to start in october
jefferson cowie and nick salvatore of cornell university have been added to this forum two historians , patrick allitt and matthew dallek , have joined the discussion katrina vanden heuvel , editor of the nation , analyzes a long national tradition of inciting opposition to a strong central government it seems that whatever president obama talks about whether it s overhauling health care , or regulating wall street , or telling schoolchildren to study hard his opponents have called him a socialist socialism was an epithet on many placards at protests in washington over the weekend what does the word mean today , nearly 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall \? what role has the label played in american political history \? is editor of , which published a forum in march called with barbara ehrenreich and others when any american reform leader takes on the status quo , he or she confronts a ferocious , wellorganized and reactionary opposition is it any surprise that rightwing groups now compare president obama to hitler and liken his pragmatic health care reform to socialism \? it s offensive and troubling but it s worth invoking history and remembering that franklin roosevelt confronted the american liberty league , which called him a socialist and a communist and he faced down father coughlin , the demagogic priest who was a cross between glenn beck and rush limbaugh in a roman collar history again the rabid protesters calling president obama a socialist are representatives of a long national tradition which features an irrational and wellstoked fear of a strong central government \( mr obama has found it more difficult to turn away from the fanatical right than his reform predecessors partly because conservative ideology has been in the saddle for three decades and the recession began too late in the bush administration to sufficiently discredit its freemarket fundamentalism and those who still speak on its behalf \) read more mr obama himself acknowledged parallels with previous battles for reform he said last month , these struggles always boil down to a contest between hope and fear that was true in the debate over social security , when fdr was accused of being a socialist that was true when lbj tried to pass medicare and it s true in this debate today i head to moscow this sunday to interview the former leader of the soviet union , mikhail gorbachev , on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall in moscow , i know that those who follow our politics are shocked that an educated nation \( that s us \) can attack a moderately liberal president for being socialist my friends email me and ask what is this complaint socialisthating americans have about the obama administration having too many czars \? oldstyle soviet communism has been discarded , in these last years , in favor of flat taxes , capitalist corruption and oligarchs meanwhile , most enlightened russians , like gorbachev or his colleague dmitri muratov , the editor of moscow s last oppositionist newspaper , novaya gazeta , seek a europeanstyle social democracy america s glenn beckinspired mobs would consider social democracy one and the same as socialism or communism but there is a difference and it is one which our history textbooks and our media have for the most part failed to fill us in on so , now we are in a vacuum , and misinformation and mendacity fills it at our peril isn t social democracy or call it socialism with a human face all about a healthy and thriving public sphere in education , health care , transportation , libraries , parks , child care \? isn t it about government programs that improve the conditions of people s lives \? if that is socialism , then medicare is our america variant of socialism we are poorer today for the divisions unleashed by those who would lash the label socialism around the neck of a moderately liberal president in order to cripple efforts by government to play a smart and humane role is the cahoon family professor of american history at emory university in atlanta he is author of the conservatives ideas and personalities throughout american history it s odd that so many critics of the administration should use socialism as a devil word in fact millions of americans , including many of these critics , are ardent supporters of socialism , even if they don t realize it and even if they don t actually use the word think of two elements of society that enjoy overwhelming popular support despite being government owned and operated the first is the public schools horace mann , in early 19thcentury massachusetts , pioneered the project of creating publicly funded schools for every child in the state the idea caught on widely and in less than a century had been emulated by every state in the union no child left behind , endorsed by a conservative administration , is the most recent incarnation of this huge , centralized socialist project the second example is the highways early auto enthusiasts asked henry ford to contribute to building a private highway system but he declined to invest and warned them that they should not create the precedent of private road ownership much better to let the government pay for a century now , governments state and federal have built an astonishing network of utterly socialist highways throughout the land so far as i know , no one has objected to driving along them for that reason read more you could even take the view that the armed forces are organized along socialist lines government owned and operated , bureaucratic , centralized , exempted from competition , they are widely beloved all the same private military contractors , on the other hand , such as blackwater , arouse more suspicion than support there is a taint of dishonor to being a mercenary and as machiavelli showed 500 years ago , mercenaries are far less dependable than citizen armies socialism by that name never became a mass movement in the united states \( the last serious socialist presidential candidate , eugene debs , ran for office from a prison cell for his criticism of president woodrow wilson in world war i \) but socialism as an organizational principle is alive and well here just as it is throughout the industrialized world is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and author of the age of reagan the conservative counterrevolution , 19801989 there is a famous anecdote about the very first meeting in 1947 of the mont pelerin society , the organization founded by milton friedman , fa hayek , ludwig von mises and other famous free marketers who later won nobel prizes and inspired margaret thatcher and ronald reagan , among others the story goes that von mises stormed out of one session declaring , you re all a bunch of socialists ! none of the oral traditions recall what heresy prompted this extremely prejudicial accusation , for surely no one in that circle was actually advocating genuine socialism maybe friedman wavered on whether there should be any public welfare provisions in the ideal free market state but that story has come back to me as i listen to the commotion about people calling barack obama a socialist if we understand socialism in its strict definition central economic planning and public ownership of the means of production then the president is obviously not a socialist \( with a mild caveat for the auto bailouts , the banks , etc \) read more but if we step back a moment and consider socialism more broadly as a step increase in political control of or intervention in the economy whether it be through a revival of keynesianstyle stimulus and things like cash for clunkers subsidies , or through a government semitakeover of the health care sector then the charge appears more salient the serious conservative critique of these socialistlike forms rests , in one sentence , on the cognitive barriers to government commanding or allocating resources effectively , which means we can expect very poor results , resembling the sluggish , centrally directed economy of britain in the 1970s that wasn t exactly socialism either , but ms thatcher effectively campaigned against it by calling it by that name , and it looks like we may need to sweep away those kind of shackles again a decade from now is an assistant professor of history at illinois state university he is the author of education and the cold war the battle for the american school , and is currently researching a book on the culture wars recent denunciations of obama s proposed healthcare plan as socialist have taken some observers by surprise , especially since the foreign threat of socialism receded two decades ago when the soviet union imploded but , as historians should know , the degree to which conservatives invoke the specter of socialism has always been more calibrated to domestic anxieties than to foreign threats elizabeth dilling s 1934 catalogue , the red network a who s who and handbook of radicalism for patriots , serves as an instructive prototype many of those listed were never members of the communist or socialist parties , yet made their way onto a list of people who composed the communistsocialist world conspiracy the list included eleanor roosevelt , mahatma gandhi , albert einstein , john dewey and jane addams read more what did they do to merit being labeled socialist \? in various ways , they represented the changes of the 20th century feminism , civil rights , decolonization , relativism and progressive education for people like dilling , socialism became a standin for these modern threats to tradition obama and universal health care represent something similar in 2009 this is not to say that all or even most of the recent howls about socialism are rooted in unconscious anxieties about modernity for many , the label serves as an effective , if cynical sledgehammer in a nation with a long history of antisocialist sentiments , if health care reform can be associated with socialism , that s good strategy for others , there are very real philosophical principles at stake in his 1944 the road to serfdom , the austrian migr friedrich hayek elaborated his laissezfaire economic principles by setting forth a political philosophy in the shadow of nazi totalitarianism , hayek argued that any government intervention into the economy was a slippery slope to authoritarianism this philosophy has carried the day for american conservatives , even after last year s financial meltdown seemingly proved laissezfaire capitalism more slippery than any government in short , lumping socialism together with all things liberal has a long history it s no surprise that such rhetoric has not gone the way of the cold war as whittaker chambers wrote in his 1952 bestselling autobiography witness when i took up my little sling and aimed at communism , i also hit something else what i hit was the forces of that great socialism revolution , which , in the name of liberalism has been inching its ice cap over the nation for two decades many conservatives would argue obama and universal health care are the latest such ice storm is professor of political science at arizona state university he is coauthor \( with richard dagger \) of political ideologies and the democratic ideal and coeditor \( with richard bellamy \) of the cambridge history of twentiethcentury political thought , among other books why are some mostly older , overwhelmingly white americans so afraid of socialism and , by extension , socialized medicine \? one explanation is that they don t actually know what socialism is , namely the public ownership and or control of the major means of production \( mines , mills , factories , etc \) for the benefit of the public at large another is that many older americans have vivid memories of the cold war and the dreaded ussr \( the second s standing for socialist \) in hindsight it seems strange and almost miraculous that at the height of the cold war a limited form of socialized medicine medicare got through the congress over the objections of the american medical association and the insurance industry , and made it to president johnson s desk \( these special interests won t make that mistake again they now have a veritable army of lobbyists assaulting capitol hill and every congressman there \) but now the cold war is over for those in their 20s and 30s , the cold war might as well be ancient history read more to many americans socialism may sound vaguely foreign and unamerican those at rallies protesting health reform now may be surprised to know that socialism and socialist have a long history in american political thought and that those terms weren t always terms of censure for the antisocialism protesters , here s a quick quiz the author of the pledge of allegiance \( 1892 \) , was a \) a conservative , b \) a liberal , c \) a socialist the answer is c francis bellamy was a socialist and a baptist minister \( yes , there actually were christian socialists , then as now \) the pledge to the flag , as it was originally called , was not descriptive of then current conditions , but it was aspirational one nation , indivisible invoked a nation undivided by differences of race , class and gender and with liberty and justice for all it envisioned a nation in which women could vote and african americans need not fear ropewielding night riders of the kkk contemporary patriots , i hope , agree with such aspirations , despite their distinctly socialist provenance it is historically false that the only real americans are conservatives and that people of other ideological persuasions are not or cannot be real americans after

conservatives argue that liberals through the new deal , fair deal , new frontier and great society have changed america from a responsibilitybased society to a rightsbased society where once the family , neighborhoods , churches and local communities solved problems at the local level , now the central government plays a far greater role conservatives see president obama s policy proposals as unwarranted extensions of government into the lives of individual citizens , creating greater citizen dependence on the government rather than fostering increased citizen independence and personal responsibility the result conservatives fear the loss of their historic liberties because president obama s healthcare proposal is the crown jewel of his agenda , conservatives have seized the moment to stem the tide of increased government control over american society and the economy they view this as a nowornever , doordie battle since the new deal , the battles over socialist or government intrusions into the lives of americans have escalated , but now the fight is more intense than ever before read more great society battles over medicare and medicaid never spilled over into the streets , but today americans have taken to the streets to fight against government intrusions into their lives , which they consider socialism for conservatives , the battle cry is liberty but for liberals , it s equality the former rests at the heart of capitalism and free markets , while the latter rests at the heart of socialism , government control and federal regulation both liberty and equality have made great contributions to american society since the nation s founding democracy needs a healthy balance and a dynamic tension between the two to survive but conservatives intently believe that president obama s policy proposals , especially on health care , will irreparably alter that balance and inflict irreversible damage they see the stakes in this battle as nothing less than a fight for the historic soul of america is the author of the right moment ronald reagan s first victory and the decisive turning point in american politics he is a visiting scholar at the bipartisan policy center and a fellow at george washington university s school of media and public affairs the raucous debate about how president obama s health care reforms will affect the american way of life has led to a surreal discussion about socialism in 2009 while the socialism label is useful to conservative politicians attempting to fire up the faithful and while some farright critics are racists eager to paint obama as vaguely unamerican , historical memory is also fueling this debate several factors are propelling this trope portraying progressives as socialists is partially traceable to late19th century debates , when defenders of unfettered capital blasted labor radicals and progressives for undermining america s free markets through a socialistic agenda the early to mid20th century witnessed a robust debate about the effects of socialist ideas and socialist politics inside the united states from the red scare after world war i to senator joseph mccarthy s rabid attacks on domestic communists after world war ii , exaggerated fears of leftwing collectivism repeatedly rattled american politics thus , it s unsurprising that an ambitious progressive president would bring these fears back into sharp relief , even though the cold war ended two decades ago read more another underacknowledged factor is that criticisms of president obama as a socialist are anchored in a conservative intellectual tradition , whose most vigorous champions included the austrian economists friedrich hayek and ludwig von mises and the conservative writer frank chodorov they highlighted the dangers of the welfare state , and others implied that new deal liberalism amounted to steps toward socialism chodorov said in 1950 that the most worrying development in academia in the 20th century s first half was the transmutation of the american character from individualist to collectivist what the socialists have done can be undone , chodorov implored , an injunction that some 2009 demonstrators seemingly have taken to heart finally , there s a longstanding fear on the right that an encroaching welfare state will turn america into old europe decadent and quasisocialistic conservatives denounced sen john kerry as a frenchman in the 2004 presidential campaign more recently , president obama s health care plans have been attacked as a giant leap into the abyss of european central planning of course , socialism has long ceased to pose an ideological or military danger to the united states yet the charge reverberates loudly in 2009 because it s firmly rooted in the conservative political tradition and anchored in america s collective consciousness even if the charges distort the reality of who president obama is and what he is trying to achieve teach american history at cornell university and are the authors of the forthcoming book , the long exception an interpretation of the new deal from fdr to obama when socialism can be used interchangeably with fascism as it often is in the heat of contemporary political debate americans are playing with historical fires they do not understand the muddle is telling america has not had a politically meaningful socialist movement since that of eugene debs early in the last century the soviet union has perished , the berlin wall has fallen , and capitalist china is our no 1 industrial competitor against such a political landscape , what meaning could the phrase socialism have even as an epithet \? read more those who hurl the sword misunderstand the role of the state in american history while they accurately point to the enormous growth in government since the civil war and claim that it has stripped americans of their individualism and selfreliance , the focus of the state s activities has been subsidizing and promoting private enterprise government growth promoted by gilded age republicans , new deal democrats and reagan revolutionaries has been one of the most enduring constants in american history despite regular election cycle pleas to shrink the size of government , a unifying theme of political experience has been the government s growing intervention in the market on behalf of the business community for an exceptional few decades , however , things were different sparked by the great depression and the rise of the new deal , the government expanded its responsibilities to include working people as well as business it was not accidental that between 1945 and 1972 , while business grew drastically , income inequality declined significantly for americans while posing no threat to the nation s wealthiest nor was it accidental that in the decades of growth since the early 70s , a reversion to uniformly probusiness policies promoted a significant rise in income inequality with the top 1 percent of all incomes enjoying the largest percentiles of growth this too is a direct result of government s beneficence to the private sector the issue , therefore , is not government intervention , yes or no rather it is on behalf of whose interests government intervenes when the government assists business by bailing out the financial markets as it often should it is called supporting the market when government helps regular folks , as with health care reform , it stirs up fears of something called socialism republican theodore roosevelt understood the central role of property for american individualism and citizenship much like those who wield the fearladen charge of socialism today but , he argued in 1910 , when human rights are in conflict with property rights , humans rights must have the upper hand , for property belongs to man and not man to property some today would call this socialism

washington ilshat hassan s flight from has brought refuge , a job at the consulting firm booz allen and an apartment in the virginia suburbs mr hassan , an intense former college professor , is among some 300 exiles from western china s uighur muslim minority who live peacefully in the washington area , where the american government has supported their prodemocracy efforts but while the united states is hosting mr hassan and the others , it has been imprisoning 17 of their countrymen in , cuba their story is my story , said mr hassan , an edge in his voice he meant his account of escape in 2003 from a repressive chinese government not the particulars , which , in the cases of the 17 detainees , have included seven years of isolation and despair the have become something of a guant namo rorschach test hapless refugees to some , dangerous plotters to others for the obama administration , the task of determining which of those portraits is correct and whether the men can be released inside the united states has raised the stakes for the president s plan to close the guant namo prison either choice is likely to provoke intense reaction the dilemma has taken on new urgency because the plan to close the prison depends on other countries' accepting some of the remaining diplomats say that with embarking on tuesday on a european trip , the effort could falter unless this country signals it is willing to take some of the guant namo prisoners at home , though , mr obama faces the prospect of a storm of protest from some quarters if he admits detainees the bush administration labeled terrorists and barred from this country already , word of the men s possible release has brought denunciations and anxiety from military groups , families of sept 11 victims and political figures i do n't think people want people that could potentially be terrorists in the united states , said representative j randy forbes , republican of virginia there were signs on tuesday that the decisionmaking process was accelerating administration officials were in interviewing the 17 men to assess their suitability for release , perhaps in the united states , one official said but a detailed review of thousands of pages of documents suggests that definitive answers about who the 17 uighurs really are will be hard to find the public record , including intelligence and other materials from court cases and military hearings , often presents a hazy picture the men ended up in american hands in afghanistan and pakistan in 2001 and 2002 , in some cases after the payment of bounties their life stories are inexact hat maker , shoe repairman , typist in the uighurs' turkic language the evidence against them has been declared dubious by federal courts but former bush administration officials said in interviews that there had been no serious effort to clear up the mysteries still , in the uighur expatriate community here , mr hassan and other refugees argue it is clear the men pose no danger they have offered to take in the men should they be released freeing the uighurs \( pronounced weegurs \) would be a singular moment in the debate over the guant namo prison critics would see a final judgment that innocent men were locked away there the specific intentions of the uighurs in afghanistan in 2001 are hard to define there is nothing else there but to learn to fight the chinese , and then go back again , one of them told a military panel the bush administration conceded last fall that none of the men were enemy combatants then the justice department argued that they should never be admitted into this country because they sought to wage terror in china lawyers for the men called that accusation imprisonment by defamation they focus on evidence that 13 of the men spent time at a uighur encampment near jalalabad , afghanistan , that the lawyers described as an innocent handful of houses bisected by dirt tracks weaponry at the uighur village , the detainees said in their military hearings , consisted of a single kalashnikov rifle and a pistol they strongly criticized chinese policies that they said included forced abortions , political imprisonments and torture of dissidents but bush administration officials said that among the uighur prisoners were three men who had been captured in an active battle zone and a firearms trainer , a uighur who claimed he had been mistaken for someone else the bush administration said the outpost was a training camp run by a uighur resistance group that was listed by the state department in 2002 as a , the east turkistan islamic movement that designation has raised as many questions as it answered the listing , which came after the 17 men were already prisoners , came at china s urging at a time when american diplomats were pressing for beijing s support for the coming war in iraq that the chinese used the terrorist listing to justify a harsh crackdown on uighur separatists , much like the beijing government s betterknown policies toward tibet but experts on china argue that the american designation of the east turkistan islamic movement appeared to be based on misinformation in 2002 , that at least eight fractious , littleknown uighur groups had committed more than 200 terrorist acts over 11 years but a few months later , the american listing blamed the east turkistan islamic movement , known as etim , for all of the supposed acts of terrorism suddenly everything was etim , said james millward , a historian at georgetown university who has written about the  dru c gladney , a china expert at pomona college , said the confusion might have exaggerated the importance of the east turkistan group , which , he said , may have had as few as 10 members still , several detainees acknowledged in testimony that their encampment in afghanistan had ties to a uighur expatriate , hasan mahsum , who described himself as the leader of the separatist etim mr mahsum denied that his group had connections to al qaeda but that denial hardly put an end to the issue he was killed by the pakistani army in 2003 in a raid on what pakistan described as a qaeda hideout the uighur files inherited by the obama administration are full of such ambiguities , the public records suggest still , five former bush administration officials said in interviews that they knew of no effort to gather new information on the men , even after a federal appeals court last june ridiculed the secret intelligence on the uighur detainees as nothing more than hearsay , the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said there was reason to believe that the source of the unattributed claims had been none other than the government of china , which the court noted might have been far from objective but , a former bush administration official said , nobody was going to go back and look at the facts again several of the former officials would discuss the intelligence issues only if granted anonymity so they would not be seen as disclosing confidential consultations but andrew j puglia levy , who was deputy general counsel of the department of homeland security , said the information raised enough questions to convince the bush administration that the men should never be permitted into the united states it s hard to say there s a norisk scenario , mr levy said the united states has said it would not release the men to china , which has demanded their return , because it fears mistreatment or torture but since 2006 , when albania took five uighurs from guant namo , some 100 other countries have refused to take the 17 others , state department officials say the uighurs' lawyers say the facts that matter most about their clients are that the men are still not free , even after the court ridiculed the intelligence and the bush administration withdrew its claims that they were enemy combatants the lead lawyer , p sabin willett , said the contradiction was powerful when he visited a client in the fall and the man was still in shackles a guy is chained to the floor , and even the court says he s not the enemy , mr willett said bitterly for , the guant namo issue has been bewildering they see the united states , which has granted some of them asylum , as a powerful ally against china yet that same country labeled some of their fellow uighurs as terrorists rebiya kadeer , a former political prisoner in china who may be the most prominent uighur leader in the united states , displayed the complexities of the guant namo issue for the exiles in a long interview her voice quivering with emotion , mrs kadeer described her own imprisonment as the act of an authoritarian government a poorly educated entrepreneur in the 1980s and 1990s , mrs kadeer was once said to have been the richest woman in what china calls the xinjiang uighur autonomous region dissidence brought the end of her audi , her three villas and her farflung business empire , which included department stores and a steel trading company after a conviction largely for mailing newspaper articles about separatism to her husband , who already had asylum in the united states , mrs kadeer , now 62 , disappeared into china s prisons and work camps for more than five years she said she was persistently threatened with death and forced to confess repeatedly that xinjiang properly belonged to china because of american pressure , mrs kadeer was released to this country in 2005 she described the detention of her countrymen at guant namo as a mistake but , she added , at least they 're alive , a fate she said would not be guaranteed if they had been sent home mr hassan , the exile who once taught at a technical college in xinjiang , said he fled his country after a failed plan to kill him he boarded a bus , he said , and grieved for what he knew might be the loss forever of his wife and 11year old son i saw my wife looking back at the bus , mr hassan said in the washington area , he joined a tightknit circle of uighur expatriates , people who have traveled a similar path out of china gather to celebrate holidays there are few old people because they were left behind but the parents and some 40 children and teenagers gather to discuss their dreams often , they say , chinese agents watch them mr hassan , though , seemed at ease he was grateful , he said , to the countless people who helped him get here so he signed up when he heard some months ago that detainees' lawyers wanted to present a relocation plan in court more than a dozen uighurs here offered shelter to any of their countrymen who might win freedom from guant namo mr hassan said he and the 17 detainees had a lot in common we have the same goal for freedom from chinese rule , he said they sacrificed for our cause
listening to president obama , i was struck by how well he understands that most voters are not driven by ideology and are not searching for politically orthodox leadership most want leaders who speak to their needs especially in this time of economic crisis and a government that works republicans in congress all but completely united in their effort to build a wall of obstruction in the path of president obama s economic revitalization effort seem to be missing this essential point in a conversation with a small group of columnists aboard air force one on friday , the president discussed the fight over his stimulus package , which was in the process of gaining final passage as he flew from washington to chicago for a brief rest with his family he said that the fact that he 'd been rebuffed so far in his quest for bipartisanship would not stop him from reaching out for republican support going forward , he said , each and every time we 've got an initiative , i'm going to go to both democrats and republicans and i'm going to say , here s my best argument for why we need to do this i want to listen to your counterarguments if you 've got better ideas , present them we will incorporate them into any plans that we make , and we are willing to compromise on certain issues that are important to one side or the other in order to get stuff done' when i asked him if there was any reason to believe that the gop had made a goodfaith effort at bipartisanship , given the fact that only three republicans voted for the stimulus plan in the senate and none in the house , he said he did not want to question the motives or sincerity of those who opposed the plan but he made a point of adding , now , i have to say that given that they were running the show for a pretty long time prior to me getting there , and that their theory was tested pretty thoroughly and it s landed us in the situation where we 've got over a trilliondollars' worth of debt and the biggest economic crisis since the great depression , i think i have a better argument in terms of economic thinking he also made it clear that he wo n't let his desire for bipartisanship undermine important initiatives i'm an eternal optimist , he said that does n't mean i'm a sap mr obama s tone and demeanor during the nearly hourlong interview was a duplicate of his nationally televised press conference last week he was relaxed and had complete command of a range of complex issues , including the troubled banking sector , health care reform and the need to do more in terms of innovative education initiatives but beyond his specific policies \( and whether one supports them or not \) , mr obama is emerging as the very model of the type of person one would want in high public office he is intelligent , mature , thoughtful , calm in the face of crises and , if the nation is lucky , maybe even wise when asked about the sharp drop in the stock markets after treasury secretary tim geithner announced an expanded bank bailout plan last week , mr obama replied i am not planning based on a oneday market reaction in fact , you can argue that a lot of the problems we 're in have to do with everybody planning based on oneday market reactions , or threemonth market reactions , and as a consequence nobody was taking the long view my job is to help the country take the long view to make sure that not only are we getting out of this immediate fix , but we 're not repeating the same cycle of bubble and bust over and over again that we 're not having the same energy conversation 30 years from now that we had 30 years ago that we 're not talking about the state of our schools in the exact same ways we were talking about them in the 1980s and that at some point we say , you know what \? if we 're spending more money percapita on health care than any nation on earth , then you 'd think everybody would have coverage and we would see lower costs for average consumers , and we 'd have better outcomes' near the end of the interview , the president said that there are certain moments in history when significant change is possible it s not a certainty , he said , but it s possible he said he believed that it s very difficult for any single individual to actually set that kind of momentum for change in motion but when that historical wave is there , he said , i think you can help guide it when asked if we are in one of those moments now , he said , yes i firmly believe that
it was supposed to be a routine journey for , a trip from his home in idaho to new york and back two days later larsen traveled east two weeks ago to tape an interview for the mlb network about pitching a perfect game for the yankees in the 1956 world series an excursion that larsen figured would take about 60 hours turned into a sixday odyssey because of brutal weather on both coasts larsen waited in line for 11 hours at one airport , cursed a borrowed cellphone after it died and wondered if he would make it home for  i 've never had problems like that before , larsen said the storms came in and , all of a sudden , i was stuck i do n't like to be stuck anywhere but larsen was stranded with countless other travelers whose plans were scuttled in middecember four days into larsen s jaunt , andrew levy , the sports marketing agent who helped plan the trip , went almost 24 hours without hearing from him so he called the police in seattle and asked if an incident report had been filed on a 79year old white male fortunately , none had been larsen said he had not seen a movie in years , so he had never seen planes , trains and automobiles , which starred steve martin and john candy still , for a few chaotic days , larsen was a calmer version of the character played by martin in the comedy about two travelers desperately trying to get home for thanksgiving you got no place to go , larsen said what are you going to do \? the interview was the seamless part of the trip two days after arriving in new york , larsen and yogi berra , the hall of famer who caught his perfect game , gathered at the network s studios in secaucus , nj , on dec 19 , a friday , to watch a film of the perfect game and discuss their memories with bob costas the game and the interviews will air on the network s first day of programming on thursday snow blanketed the area as larsen was reminiscing about the only perfect game in world series history , so he never trekked to newark airport for his scheduled flight to seattle larsen , who had left his hotel that morning , returned to manhattan and checked into a different hotel he had another flight scheduled for saturday afternoon larsen took a limousine to newark on saturday and waited for several hours after the flight was canceled , larsen was told that his best chance to get to seattle was to fly out of on sunday larsen switched to his third hotel in three days on sunday , larsen went to kennedy and had a groundhog day experience as another flight was canceled if larsen hurried , he was told , he could get a flight out of newark levy quickly arranged for a car service to take larsen to newark finally , larsen s flight took off once larsen landed in seattle , he stepped outside the terminal to smoke a cigarette and call his wife , corrine larsen , who grudgingly borrowed her cellphone for the trip , was frustrated when it died after one minute i did n't even want the phone , he said from seattle , larsen said he started to feel closer to home all he needed to do was hop a flight to spokane , wash , where he had left his car , and then make the onehour drive to his home in hayden lake , idaho he was so close or was he \? it was about 7 pm in seattle when larsen got in line to ask about his flight larsen stayed in line for 11 hours because the airport was shuttered after a snowstorm , he waited like every other passenger larsen , the strapping former pitcher with the silvery hair , never contacted anyone and left the line only once i had to go to the bathroom , he said by monday morning , levy grew anxious because he and corrine had not heard from larsen levy contacted the airport police , even sent them photographs of larsen via email yvette freixas , a travel agent who worked with larsen as flight after flight was canceled , suggested that corrine check her husband s credit cards for recent activity sure enough , larsen had checked into a hotel in seattle as levy waited for the call to be connected to larsen s room , he said he was still concerned that something was awry when larsen answered , levy said he acted as if they had spoken five minutes earlier levy said he asked larsen what he was doing and larsen snapped , what do you think i'm doing \? a few seconds later , larsen asked levy for his new itinerary levy said he would provide it , but he first had to call everyone who was worried larsen was surprised that there was a search party of sorts for him when levy asked larsen why he failed to call anyone , he said that the cellphone had broken levy reminded larsen that his hotel room had a phone well , whatever , larsen said when am i getting out of here \? larsen added that he did not call corrine because he did not want to worry her with christmas three days away , larsen , who had been unflappable as he lived out of one carryon bag , was exhausted and told levy he just wanted to get home he secured a flight to spokane on monday afternoon there was one last hurdle larsen s van with the numbers 000 on its license plate was buried in snow in spokane the normally meticulous larsen did not care he brushed off enough snow to see and puttered along the icy roads at 25 miles an hour next christmas , larsen said , he is not traveling anywhere you wo n't see me back there in '09 , larsen said not unless they do it in hawaii
eight years have now passed since the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , and the victims , their families and the rest of america are still denied justice the united states has tried and convicted one person for those horrifying crimes the bush administration captured about a dozen highranking al qaeda members , including khalid sheikh mohammed , the selfproclaimed mastermind of 9 11 but president bush refused to subject them to real trials under american law mr bush claimed that the attacks had changed the world so much that both civilian and military courts were no longer adequate to try and punish terrorists that was wrong then , and still is the nation has always had the tools it needs to do that job legally and without jeopardizing secrets or shredding the constitution but mr bush created his own detention camps and , later , military tribunals where guilty verdicts were guaranteed this rogue system has done enormous damage to the country s reputation and made the world even more dangerous for american citizens it took years for american courts to reject the camps and the tribunals , which have never held a successful trial the only 9 11related conviction was that of zacarias moussaoui , who pleaded guilty in a civilian court to six charges of conspiring with the hijackers the blame for justice delayed , and the continuing damage to america s standing , no longer rests solely with mr bush lawmakers from both parties are thwarting president obama s efforts to close the guant namo bay prison camp they posture and prey on american anxieties , talking about turning terrorists loose in the united states , as if the prison system were not already holding dangerous men , including convicted terrorists it now seems certain the administration will not be able to meet president obama s january 2010 deadline to close guant namo , and it is not clear how long it will take to hold legitimate trials even after it is closed some , mostly on the right , argue that trials are not needed they say that following rules of evidence hamstrings intelligence agents pursuing terrorists , and that the president should have the power to lock up some prisoners indefinitely mr obama has resisted that idea , and should continue to do so he also has fixed some of the worst flaws of mr bush s tribunals , including their use of evidence obtained through abuse and torture but mr obama needs to finally reject the idea that nonmilitary prisoners may be tried in military courts prisoners captured on the battlefield in afghanistan should be held as prisoners of war , under red cross monitoring if they committed war crimes , they may be tried by military tribunals those captured outside afghanistan who are directly participating in hostilities by doing such things as directing troops also should be treated as battlefield prisoners but those captured in other parts of the world on terrorism charges not directly related to afghanistan are criminal suspects they should be tried in federal criminal courts the bush administration refused to do that , claiming that the evidence was too sensitive and too secret we have been discouraged to hear mr obama make a similar argument on occasion the federal courts have long been able to handle cases involving classified evidence right now , the federal court hearing guant namo inmates' petitions to be released routinely handles secrets and the resistance to criminal trials for the worst terrorism suspects does not come only from a desire to safeguard what the intelligence agencies know it also springs from a desire to cover up what the agencies did the recently released report by the cia inspector general said the agency wants to avoid trials for prisoners who would likely divulge information about the circumstances of their detention some of the evidence against guant namo prisoners may not be usable in court , because they were abused and tortured under orders approved by the justice department and the white house but none of these worst offenders need to be set free for some , like mr mohammed , there are federal terrorism indictments not related to 9 11 and untainted by abuse others can be tried under the law against providing material support to terrorists , which is written very broadly that may not be as satisfying as convicting them for mass murder but it would be better to settle for a lesser conviction that would still mean long imprisonment this nation s legal structure and reputation cannot afford the continuing harm , and the victims of 9 11 deserve justice
east rutherford , nj made his 2009 debut with the on thursday at giants stadium two years ago , he made his wildly celebrated debut in the league , but this time there was no carnival atmosphere , no breathless promotion , none of the hysteria of 2007 , when beckham was portrayed as mls s savior the fervor has subsided , and this much has become clear beckham is not soccer s savior , but rather a moses figure who may not be playing when soccer reaches its ultimate destination but he says he is fully committed to the journey during a news conference before the galaxy s game thursday against the red bulls , was asked at times pointedly about his goals and his commitment to the galaxy and the league after spending the last six months on loan playing for ac milan the first question was whether he felt he owed galaxy ticket holders an apology for missing so many games he did not think so i'm dedicated to the fans , he said beckham s words were more important than anything he did in the galaxy s 31 victory over the woeful red bulls , for there was none of the fawning of 2007 but instead tough questions about his commitment to helping soccer in the united states , playing in the world cup and fulfilling his contractual obligations to the galaxy and to mls in responding to questions about these seemingly conflicting goals , beckham outlined an ambitious agenda he wants to represent england in the 2010 world cup and plans to fulfill his obligations to the galaxy and carry out his role with mls as an ambassador and , he said , he wants to fulfill the larger mission of popularizing soccer in this country i want to be involved in the world cup , i 've not hidden that fact , he said whenever i'm called up for a squad with my country , i will turn up it does n't matter i 've always done the same throughout my whole career beckham said that managers in england had made it clear that the only way for him to make the 2010 english national team was to go on loan again for at least six months and to play at a european level on the other hand , beckham said he intended to fulfill his obligations to the galaxy and mls being part of this team and being successful with this team i'm committed to this i'm committed to bruce , he said , referring to the galaxy and its coach and general manager , bruce arena i'm committed to the players i'm committed to the mls as an ambassador he s also committed to carrying the banner for soccer in the united states we want to carry on growing this game , he said it s the reason that i wanted to be involved in this for me it s about creative visualization , and i visualize that this game will take off and get bigger in years to come and i want to be part of that that s noble and ambitious , but it also represents a lot on his plate someone asked beckham , who has missed half of the galaxy s mls games the previous two seasons and the first 17 this year , if he might be spreading himself too thin with commitments to different teams and publicrelations appearances had he lost sight of the source of his blessings , soccer \? my career and my whole life has been about soccer , he said nothing else yeah , i have the advertising and the appearances , but not once in my whole 17year career have i let anything get in the way so not once have i stepped out of that zone of my first job as a soccer player nothing else grant wahl , a writer for sports illustrated whose book the beckham experiment was published this week , asked beckham how he justified being committed to the galaxy and to mls when he is a parttime player this year and whether he will be a parttime player next year as well let me just clear this up first , beckham said tersely is this question for the second unofficial book or your magazine \? beckham needs reinforcements clearly , the infatuation that was so apparent the last two years has faded what he did previously was wildly cheered , but thursday night every move he made was booed it s to be expected , he said it s sometimes nice to get the boos , it gives you some inspiration there is speculation that thierry henry could be headed to mls after the 2010 season , although beckham has pointed out in the last two years that soccer s battle for the american consumer s heart is a multilayered long haul and not really about bringing in big names and megastars progress is like the game itself built on endurance and subtleties like i said the first day i arrived , this is not going to happen over one or two years , beckham said it s going to happen over 5 , 10 years , and if i'm not playing by the time it takes off and really takes off like we hope it will , and like we know it will , then i 'll still be part of it , because i'm committed to it and i'm committed to the cause beckham is the prophet , not the savior
london every so often , britons like to measure their present against a past that time has in some ways overtaken doughty , imperial , island folk with a reach far beyond their shores , suffused with a backstothewall fighting spirit , conjuring victory against the odds from shakespeare s henry v rallying his troops against the french at agincourt in 1415 to the english soccer team beating the germans in the 1966 world cup \( not to mention , as some people would always include in the catalog of triumph , two world wars \) , this is a narrative built on the high points of national memory , a connectthedots guide to an old land s sense of what it has done , and can do , best recently , there seems to have been a sunburst of such reflected glory last month , the funeral of harry patch , the last british survivor of the fighting in the trenches on the western front in world war i , drew national , live television coverage as his coffin wound through the cathedral city of wells escorted by , among others , german soldiers it offered an occasion to ponder his message of war s futility , challenging the government s efforts to justify a war in afghanistan that is leeching the lives of the soldiers it sends there but of all those moments , none seems quite so determinedly quirky , and yet so perversely predictable , as the ascent this week to the top of the british music charts of a collection of songs by vera lynn , at 92 the oldest person to attain that artistic peak songs that first became popular in world war ii , known probably as much to american service personnel based in britain at that time as to the british themselves vera lynn was known as the forces' sweetheart , the lyrics and lilt of her music resonating as much with the troops on farflung battlefields as with those left behind to work on farms and in munitions factories , facing the harsh austerity and perils of war in the parlance of the era , keeping the homes fires burning bestknown among vera lynn s songs were we 'll meet again and the white cliffs of dover , offering a reminder that , in war , it is not only the troops in battle who shoulder the burden , ears ringing with the blast of roadside bombs or the enormous , intimate rattle of automatic fire back home , there are those who wait and fret and hope for solace and on the front lines , soldiers cherish snapshots and mementos of those left behind then , as now , vera lynn s lyrics offered what she called a bit of home and a bit of cheer and comfort for me , growing up in babyboom britain , the memory of her songs became intertwined with the stories of wartime separation and home guard heroics at family gatherings as britain emerged from rationing and deprivation to find that victory coupled uneasily with a greatly reduced role in a changed world the family chronicles told how husbands and wives spent years apart , how uncles were assigned to douse the flames of bombing on britain s northwestern shipyards , how aunts stoically packed up one home and moved to another after the baleful wail of the airraid sirens sent families scurrying into homemade shelters while bombs blew out the windows and flattened the roofs of their row houses in those moments of danger and absence , with soldiers far from home and enemy bombers in the skies , imagine scratchy radios tuned to the bbc , serenading its listeners with lyrics that promised bluebirds and peace in the white cliffs of dover , vera lynn assured the nation that there 'll be love and laughter and peace ever after tomorrow when the world is free and in we 'll meet again , she conjured the end of those long absences when a simple telegram could bear tidings of the ultimate loss we 'll meet again do n't know where do n't know when but i know we 'll meet again some sunny day many , of course , did not make that rendezvous with hope her album s rise to the top of the charts begs the question why now \? britain , after all , was different then people had different dreams , narrower horizons , lower expectations the daily joust was literally about survival , not comfort consumerism was impossible for most people in an era when meat and cheese and butter were rationed and the candies and nylon stockings given as gifts by american troops seemed the height of luxury but there are faint similarities britain , like america and other allies , is again at war counting from the beginnings in 2001 of the current conflict in afghanistan and the invasion of iraq in 2003 , troops have been deployed in battle for longer though with far few casualties than in all the years of world war ii , from germany s invasion of poland in 1939 \( also recalled this month on its 70th anniversary \) to the defeat of germany and japan in 1945 in excruciatingly relative terms , britain also faces the same hardship as others in a world struggling to shrug off recession in a land with far less appetite for selfdenial than vera lynn s generation , jobs are scarcer , house prices are down with elections due by next summer at the latest , there were stern and policyreversing warnings this week from prime minister gordon brown of cuts in public spending perilous talk for a politician in a time of war one of the first electoral casualties of vera lynn s day was winston churchill , the very symbol of bulldog britain , shoved rudely out of power in the first postwar election in 1945 vera lynn last topped the charts in 1952 in the aftermath of those same austere days our boys are away again , she said this week to explain her success , and the music is significant again and it s a bit of nostalgia , too others have drawn similar conclusions lovely tunes have been out of favor for some time , the columnist michele hanson wrote in the guardian it s been all screeching , thumping , rapping , crashing rage and multidecibels , but not much melody and modulation , so perhaps we need a bit of a change
it seems like yesterday that we moved to new york city from youngstown , ohio one of us came here to attend the fashion institute of technology , and the other wanted to jump into the art world we waited tables to make ends meet with 5 , 000 in hand , we eventually opened a small office in new york city s garment center and began making nanette lepore clothing designed by one of us , marketed by the other , sold by both after many years of hard work , we managed to build a successful business none of this could have happened if not for the garment center an area where zoning law protects apparel manufacturing space the blocks from 34th to 40th streets between broadway and ninth avenue have been home to america s fashion industry for more than 100 years but all that could change the district is in danger of disappearing , with its factories and workers forced out by landlords seeking higherpaying tenants a sad prospect on labor day \( or any other day \) mayor bloomberg is considering a solution that sounds fine on the surface , but we believe would mean the end of the district garment manufacturers would be given protected space in a large building or two , and the rest of the area would be up for grabs it s fair to ask why we still need a garment district but even in the internet era , proximity offers many advantages designers are able to work alongside manufacturers we can stop by factories to inspect garments , change the fit or correct the sewing manufacturing locally , as opposed to overseas , allows us to quickly increase or decrease production , depending on what customers want , and is the only affordable option for young designers with limited resources working on a small scale more important , in close quarters a mutual respect develops across the chain of production the people who make the clothes are as passionate as the designers both vision and execution benefit from this relationship , and that s why we do 85 percent of our manufacturing within five blocks of our 35th street office the city once recognized these benefits , and that s why it passed a zoning law limiting the conversion of the area s factory space to offices in 1987 , in an effort to keep garment makers from being priced out \( something that had been going on since the district s midcentury heyday \) but the city stopped enforcing the law in 1993 , and although the bloomberg administration devoted some new funds to enforcement in 2005 , it simultaneously weakened the zoning restrictions it s easy to see that many landlords still get away with breaking the rules , and we 've heard of only one landlord ever getting prosecuted so floor by floor over the years , manufacturing space has been quietly diverted to other uses , and manufacturing jobs have moved overseas the city s proposed exchange offers garment manufacturers 280 , 000 square feet in exchange for freeing the rest of the district from the zoning restrictions , but this is far less space than is needed currently apparel manufacturing occupies 16 percent of the area , or more than a million square feet in february , mayor bloomberg called the fashion industry a vital part of our city s economy , providing 175 , 000 jobs and generating billions of dollars annually and said that ensuring the industry s success is more important than ever as we work to retain and create jobs during these difficult times but the city has done far too little , and giving up on zoning is n't a solution we need a zoning law that ensures that the space now devoted to garment manufacturing is preserved for that purpose , and we need the city to enforce it the city should create a board with representatives from the fashion industry to review applications for leases within the zoned area if an applicant qualifies and is granted a lease , the board should follow up to make sure the business is in fact a garment manufacturer misrepresentation should be prosecuted as a criminal violation if the zoning is lifted , the floodgates will open small shops , showrooms and jobs will disappear , along with a national landmark a statue of an immigrant with a sewing machine stands at the center of this district , honoring the people who came to work here from around the world , and the sidewalks are carved with the names of our designers american fashion has a rich history we want to make sure it has a future and that depends on preserving new york city s garment center
indian wells , calif when andy ram walked onto court no 6 for a doubles match sunday night at the bnp paribas open , he was not escorted by two security guards there were no discernible protesters outside and there were actually fans sitting in the stands , 186 of them at one point in the match when shahar peer prepared to play anna chakvetadze less than two hours earlier , her focus was on staying aggressive , not on getting a visa for ram and peer , both israeli tennis players , this represented a return to normalcy , a night when sport was played for sport s sake they performed far from the main stage where rafael nadal and andy roddick played their audiences were outnumbered by the one that watched roger federer on the practice court but they felt like tennis players again instead of political tennis balls my last three weeks was more politics than sport , ram said it s good to be here and focus on tennis and have fans screaming it s nice to get a normal atmosphere again for much of the last month , ram and peer have been drawn into world politics with tensions high in the middle east after israel s strikes on gaza began in late december , peer was denied a visa by the united arab emirates to play in the dubai open , which began feb 15 after a torrent of criticism , talk of cancellation by the wta , and the intervention of united states government officials , ram was granted a visa for the men s tournament that started the next week ram played amid heavy security last week , he was part of israel s davis cup victory in sweden , where the government ordered the match played in an empty arena because of security concerns the match drew thousands of protesters outside so it was with no small twist that peer scored a 62 , 64 thirdround upset of 19thseeded chakvetadze , against whom she was scheduled to open the dubai tournament and ram teamed with max mirnyi of belarus to defeat martin damm of the czech republic and robert lindstedt of sweden in the first round , 63 , 67 \( 5 \) , 1210 ram avenged a loss to lindstedt in their davis cup doubles match and we both won , ram said when peer entered court no 4 and walked to her chair , a fan shouted america loves you , shahar there were two israeli flags in the crowd , along with a sign urging peer on with her name written in hebrew although peer lost the opening games of each set , she relentlessly roamed the baseline , sending ball after ball back at chakvetadze , waiting for her to make a mistake after squandering a 41 lead in the second set , peer steadied herself after winning several key points , she shouted kadima forward there are so many things about her that seem so quintessentially israeli , said jennifer wiener , a denver resident who has lived in israel she s resilient and a fighter i'm sure a lot of other athletes are like that , but to put herself out there like that is very gutsy it s inspiring peer , 21 , had been hoping to become the first israeli athlete to compete in the united arab emirates , which has used its oil riches to lure elite tennis players , golfers , soccer teams and racehorses to dubai for competitions she said that not being allowed to play in dubai hurt for two reasons the discrimination and the adverse effect three weeks off had on her game i was on a good run and unfortunately , it stopped , peer said then i had to practice again , and practicing too much is no good i like to compete i'm happy to be finding my tennis now ram is clearly happy to be playing unencumbered from the moment he landed in dubai , a 15person security detail surrounded him he was escorted to and from his hotel by three cars , traveling different routes each time he ate in his hotel room and was not allowed to visit the players' lounge ram s trip was quick he lost his first match it was a professional decision to win points and money but it turned out to be one of my greatest experiences , said ram , 29 , a 2008 australian open doubles champion who is ranked 12th in the world none of the players , not even federer or nadal , has experienced what i experienced there it s impossible to forget ram and peer say they have helped open a door though the wta received some criticism for not canceling the event after peer s visa request was denied , it fined the tournament directors 300 , 000 the tennis channel canceled weekend coverage of the event , and roddick pulled out of the men s event in protest the wta said if peer is not allowed to play next year , it will pull out i was really impressed and very happy by the way roddick was reacting , said peer , who last year became the first israeli to play in a gulf arab state by entering a tournament in qatar but i do n't want to charge anybody it s an individual sport not everybody can do it ram says he considers himself an optimist , which was not difficult to figure after he bounced around the court sunday night , slapping hands with mirnyi after lost points and chasing lost balls into the front row of seats his optimism was not misplaced on the court , when he and mirnyi fought off two match points in their victory he says he does not believe it will be off the court , either it sounds kind of big to say it , but hopefully , it s not going to be just israelis going to dubai , ram said it s going to be something global for every athlete tomorrow , if some guy from taipei wants to play in china and they wo n't allow it , they 'll have this case that shows that anything is possible the dubai government accepted me i do n't see a reason why it should n't be the same everywhere
here are two headlines from this morning s haaretz on the israeli election  livni claims victory , declaring the people chose kadima and netanyahu rightwing led by likud won a clear victory  what gives \? parliamentary politics , my friends the jerusalem post explains  both foreign minister tzipi livni s kadima party and binyamin netanyahu s opposition likud styled themselves the winners of tuesday s elections , after it became apparent that kadima had won the most seats in the new knesset , but the likudled rightwing would constitute the larger bloc with 997 percent of the votes counted , kadima was narrowly leading likud with a predicted 28 mandates , while the latter had garnered a predicted 27 seats israel beiteinu was expected to earn 15 mandates , labor 13 , shas 11 , united arab list four , united torah judaism five , national union four , hadash four , meretz three , bayit hayehudi three , and balad three so who s really winning \? carl of israel matsav handicaps the race  i n israel this morning , the word is that israeli diplomats in washington are already trying to explain to the obama administration what happened and anticipating a rightleaning coalition led by the likud s binyamin netanyahu \( 27 seats \) that s because yisrael beiteinu leader avigdor lieberman \( 15 seats \) has already signaled that he will recommend netanyahu be given the first opportunity to form a coalition and with shas \( 11 seats \) , united torah judaism \( 5 seats \) , national union \( 4 seats \) and jewish home \( 3 seats \) all expected to recommend netanyahu , peres will be told by 64 of israel s 120 mk s that netanyahu should be given the first opportunity \( the numbers i am using are from an 8 00 am israel radio report with 98 of the polling stations counted the only change you might have noticed is that yisrael beiteinu is back to 15 the 2 that remain to be counted are mostly idf and foreign service ballots the idf ballots are rumored to be heavily tilted to the right and include far more ballots than the foreign service \) either way , it was a huge comeback for likud \( which was at 12 seats in the current government elected in 2006 \) and a massive defeat for ehud barak s labor \( which had won 19 seats in 2006 \) , adds the american spectator s philip klein the inconclusive results could be the worst possible outcome for israel , as the lack of mandate by any party could mean in a muddled policy siun at firedoglake feels everyone lost  while the final results are uncertain , they are all too clear no matter which candidate wins in the end , the leadership will be one of the hawks livni , who not so long ago was trumpeted as the new progressive option , has since done everything she could to prove herself as bloodthirsty as her brethren netanyahu s thuggish but oh so popular posturing set the bar the others decimated gaza to meet neither direction offers hope of genuine and just peace donald douglas at american power doesn t think much of that sort of thinking it ll be very interesting to see usisraeli relations evolve with netanyahu in power \( if it comes to that \) , pressing the us from the right , while the hardline proterror factions in the us hammer the obama administration from the extreme left
perhaps the most telling line in the oxford english dictionary s definition of socialism is this one the range of application of the term is broad that s something to bear in mind as we consider a muchdiscussed poll , released by rasmussen on thursday , that found that only 53 of american adults believe capitalism is better than socialism for the record , here is the primary oed definition a theory or system of social organization based on state or collective ownership and regulation of the means of production , distribution , and exchange for the common benefit of all members of society advocacy or practice of such a system , esp as a political movement now also any of various systems of liberal social democracy which retain a commitment to social justice and social reform , or feature some degree of state intervention in the running of the economy as for rasmussen s definition , well , there isn t one the question posed by rasmussen reports did not define either capitalism or socialism but the pollsters did point out an anomaly it is interesting to compare the new results to an earlier survey in which 70 of americans prefer a freemarket economy the fact that a freemarket economy attracts substantially more support than capitalism may suggest some skepticism about whether capitalism in the united states today relies on free markets so , has the nation really drifted that far to the left , or are we simply struggling with our semantics \? plenty of folks in the blogosphere were happy to answer that question steve benen , the political animal , is pleased , but also sees a shifting in the lexicon in terms of interpreting these results , the numbers certainly aren t what i expected , and it s hard to know why respondents answered as they did perhaps capitalism lost some of its appeal when our economy collapsed maybe a lot of people heard the media connect obama and socialism , and since they like the president , they figure socialism can t be that bad in a similar vein , if rightwing blowhards like limbaugh keep screaming that socialism is manifestly evil , there may be some who assume the economic model must have merit but i was especially intrigued by the 27 who weren t sure which was better talk about a sign of the times more than one in four aren t quite sure whether capitalism or socialism is the superior system mark thompson at the league of ordinary gentlemen feels his fellow conservatives have nobody to blame but themselves when you falsely complain that every single thing your opponents try to do is socialism and absurdly hold your bloviating , unpopular selves up as bastions of capitalism , you probably shouldn t be surprised when people start thinking socialism doesn t look so bad , and capitalism doesn t look so good , he writes let the record also reflect that i , personally , remain firmly with the 53 percent i just don t blame the other 47 percent for thinking otherwise matt yglesias of think progress feels that times have changed enough that socialism is good branding the whole idea is that we should put society first rather than capital , or money that sounds good ! but in the united states we never had a socialist party so socialism was primarily associated with the union of soviet socialist republics which was not at all good but to people under 30 , there s less of that old resonance and saying that obama , who s popular , is a socialist may simply tend to make people have warmer feelings toward the word socialism the new republic s john judis seems to think the poll s younger respondents have a better fix on things than the oed according to the poll , 53 percent of americans think capitalism is preferable to socialism , while 20 percent say socialism is preferable and among those trustworthy adults under thirty , 37 percent prefer capitalism , 33 percent socialism , and 30 percent are weighing the alternatives what , you might ask , does this all mean \? i don t think it s a vote for sovietstyle socialism while cold war conservatives did their best to identify socialism , and european social democracy , with soviet or cuban communism , the identification doesn t seem to have survived the cold war itself instead , what those 30 percent of underthirties probably mean by socialism is a much greater degree of government and public control of private corporations and of the market that would put the united states closer , say , to sweden , france , or germany , but would not put it anywhere near the old soviet union , which tried to abolish the market itself most of all , i imagine , it s an expression of extreme disillusionment with the magic of the market as preached by republicans and some democrats as well it s also , i think , not an incorrect understanding of socialism as a political philosophy , socialism predated marx as any reader of the communist manifesto or of socialism utopian and scientific is aware in america , too , there were christian socialists like walter rauschenbusch , who was an important influence on martin luther king , and prairie socialists in kansas or oklahoma who never envisioned giving up their farms for socialism the point that runs through all these many varieties was not collectivism , but instead the subjection of large banks and businesses to social priorities people before profits , as bill clinton said in 1992 and that s what those 20 percent of americans in the rasmussen poll seem to be opting for mcq at qando , however , sees this youthful exuberance as little more than na vet as you ll note , the older someone is , the more likely they are to understand what socialism is and how it is inferior to captialism the under 30 crowd , with no wisdom and little practical experience outside of academia not to mention having not yet completely traded their utopian fantasies for the best practical system which has been shown to work have a large group who either believe socialism is better or just aren t with it enough to have an opinion once past 30 , and having put a few years under their belt in the real world , suddenly the utopian scales begin to fall from their eyes and they have a bit of an epiphany as for those over 40 being so strongly for capitalism , most of them remember the old ussr and how well socialism worked there while dr steven taylor at poliblog thinks we should ignore the whole thing given that it is manifestly clear from recent political rhetoric that people in general have no idea what an appropriate definition of either of these terms is , it is impossible to ably interpret these results further , if we assume that part of the question did include the issue of which is better we would have to know what that meant to the respondents as well better at doing what \? others on the right , however , are alarmed tigerhawk blames the tax code the percentage who approve of capitalism in this poll \( 53 \) is very close to the percentage of the population that pays \( or belongs to a family that pays \) any federal income tax \( as of 2006 , 59 \) indeed , since the top 50 paid more than 97 of all federal income collected in 2006 , it is safe to say that the proportion who support capitalism , as opposed to socialism , is almost identical in size to the percentage of americans who earn enough actual income to pay material income taxes while the correlation between the two groups is not perfect no doubt there are hollywood types , professors , and united states representatives who both pay income taxes and profess to be socialists it is almost certainly high again , it should not surprise us that the beneficiaries of socialism would support it , and the people who pay for it would prefer a system that allows them to keep more of what they produce and , as kathy at comments from left field points out , steveegg at sister toldjah blames the schools the worse news is that those under 30 are almost evenly divided , with 37 saying capitalism is better , 33 saying socialism is better , and 30 unsure of what they think it is not a coincidence that the radicals of the late 1960s were entering the decisionlevel positions of the education establishment 30 years ago susan duclos of wake up america , however , urges her compatriots to see the glass as 53 percent full rasmussen headlines with just 53 say capitalism better than socialism in that results piece it shows that 53 percent of american s prefer capitalism over socialism , with only 20 percent thinking socialism is preferable and 27 percent that are not sure what they believe amazing they would headline with the word just in there when it clearly shows the majority , 53 percent , favors capitalism with a 33 percent different between the two opposite ends of the spectrum i don t even count the unsure totals because even if you divide it straight down the middle you still have 33 percent more favoring capitalism many think 53 percent is not a large enough number , but considering socialism only gets a solid 20 percent support , i say the numbers are very good indeed and people shouldn t focus on those who are unsure because when capitalism is called free market economy that 53 percent rises considerably to 70 percent dr helen smith , aka mrs instapundit , manages to agree with both duclos and steveegg frankly , i am amazed that so many people think that capitalism is better that s a good sign also , i wonder if most americans , especially the younger ones could even give an adequate definition of socialism and capitalism perhaps they just hear the buzzword , socialism , and say that is better , like some kind of trained parrot no surprise there , with what they learn in many schools but jesse taylor at pandagon thinks that while education is a red herring , one of the right s favorite events of the last halfcentury actually kicked off the trend what element of modern primary and secondary pedagogy over the past , say , 20 years has led our youth to believe that socialism is awesome \? actually , nothing the real secret is that the berlin wall fell , which paved the way for conservatives to call everything democrats have proposed in the interim socialism \( this isn t to say that they weren t doing that before , but it became much easier for them to say it without the giant socialist enemy beast forcing us to duck and cover under our desks every day \) i came up in a world where socialism was defined in popular parlance as liberalism bill clinton , effectively a liberal republican , was a socialist barack obama , a moderate democrat , is a socialist there s an actual socialist in the senate , and yet all the democrats in the senate \( except ben nelson and evan bayh \) \? socialists the main people responsible for the embrace of socialism are the procapitalist conservatives who ve so diluted its meaning that it s okay to embrace socialism , because the majority party in the country and our tremendously popular president are socialists so , amid all this partisan bickering and sophistic solipsism , enter the minence grise of marxist historians writing at the guardian \( and commenting on a real crisis rather than a methodically questionable poll \) , eric hobsbawm raises a question socialism has failed now capitalism is bankrupt so what comes next \? the basic idea that dominated economics and politics in the last century has patently disappeared down the plughole of history this was the way of thinking about modern industrial economies , or for that matter any economies , in terms of two mutually exclusive opposites capitalism or socialism we have lived through two practical attempts to realise these in their pure form the centrally stateplanned economies of the soviet type and the totally unrestricted and uncontrolled freemarket capitalist economy the first broke down in the 1980s , and the european communist political systems with it the second is breaking down before our eyes in the greatest crisis of global capitalism since the 1930s impotence therefore faces both those who believe in what amounts to a pure , stateless , market capitalism , a sort of international bourgeois anarchism , and those who believe in a planned socialism uncontaminated by private profitseeking both are bankrupt the future , like the present and the past , belongs to mixed economies in which public and private are braided together in one way or another but how \? that is the problem for everybody today , but especially for people on the left nobody seriously thinks of returning to the socialist systems of the soviet type not only because of their political faults , but also because of the increasing sluggishness and inefficiency of their economies though this should not lead us to underestimate their impressive social and educational achievements on the other hand , until the global free market imploded last year , even the socialdemocratic or other moderate left parties in the rich countries of northern capitalism and australasia had committed themselves more and more to the success of freemarket capitalism indeed , between the fall of the ussr and now i can think of no such party or leader denouncing capitalism as unacceptable none were more committed to it than new labour in their economic policies both tony blair and \( until october 2008 \) gordon brown could be described without real exaggeration as thatcher in trousers the same is true of the democratic party in the us well , that s not very cheery and why is it a problem primarily for the left \? you may say that s all over now we re free to return to the mixed economy the old toolbox of labour is available again everything up to nationalisation so let s just go and use the tools once again , which labour should never have put away but that suggests we know what to do with them we don t for one thing , we don t know how to overcome the present crisis none of the world s governments , central banks or international financial institutions know they are all like a blind man trying to get out of a maze by tapping the walls with different kinds of sticks in the hope of finding the way out for another , we underestimate how addicted governments and decisionmakers still are to the freemarket snorts that have made them feel so good for decades a progressive policy needs more than just a bigger break with the economic and moral assumptions of the past 30 years it needs a return to the conviction that economic growth and the affluence it brings is a means and not an end lovely thought , that , but it does bring up the question of what end we re looking for , and we re hardly likely to find social consensus there call it a contradiction of marxism in any case , barbara o brien of the mahablog anticipates a few other criticisms hobsbawm is likely to engender and attempts to nip them in the bud the true believers of both sides will argue no , no , no , pure marxism free market capitalism has never been tried but pure anything has never been tried that s the reality of our human condition any endeavor that requires human input is never pure it will suffer some degree of corruption put together people , money , and power , and corruption is a certainty that s why any workable , sustainable model factors in corruption and makes some provision to keep it to a minimum that s what the marxists and the ayn rand culties cannot understand there has to be a way to reign in the power , to diffuse it , to oversee it and make it accountable to other power that s one reason the public and private sector need each other to keep each other semihonest nicholas john mead has similar predictions on how hobsbawm will be received many of the comments that follow his piece however take issue with his assertion that socialism has failed the communist brand of socialism practiced in russia wasn t socialism at all more a vicious state centralised authoritarianism that had little to do with true socialist ideals the same could be said however for the type of neoliberal capitalism we have today which has strayed so far from the principles and ideals of pure capitalism as outlined by founders such as adam smith that it s almost unfair to say that capitalism has failed also another british blogger , karl naylor , thinks britain might be primed for the revolution in many ways , britain under new labour has been a feeble old body politic artificially hooked up to a life support machine through the injection of capital , migrants , indeed of life from elsewhere whilst its internal organs have started to pack up the cosmetic changes after 1997 did nothing to reform what had been going wrong with britain relying on london as the dynamo sucking international capital and injecting it back out across the rest of a lame deindustrialised candyfloss economy and listless acres of legoland the way in which britain has deluded itself that even if it is not an economic and political powerhouse of the global economy it can be a global player , with lilliputan figures like foreign secretary david miliband positively demanding nato expansion into eastern europe in the face of big bully russia where new labour commissars , liberal mandarins and the british council have desperately sought to emphasise that britain s cultural power makes it fit to strut about on the world stage and pontificate about how great it is and why the world should buy into its stupid universe of pop royalty dreck and bbc costume dramas the harder the crash , the better it might be for britain it might finally wake up to the reality of its shrunken economy , decaying political system , and overextended strategical posture and try to live within its means , as well as to just stop pontificating about the superiority of its supposedly higher values and o brien , for her part , thinks that liberals in the united states might be in a stronger position than their british counterparts hobsbawm talks about recent british history , new labour and thatcherism but similar things go on here \( is it the almostcommon language \? \) our right has effectively taken itself out of the conversation \( even though it won t shut up \) because it can t let go of its old ideologies and aphorisms that don t work any more i m not sure if what passes for a left here is fully cognizant of the new reality , either but unlike the right , the current left has no one economic model that we all put on an altar and worship at least some among us are looking hard at the current reality and thinking through solutions that might work in the real world , as opposed to solutions that make good sound bites and look good on a bumper sticker so there you have it the worse the crash the better off we are , good riddance to the altar of freemarket capitalism , and we re now following blind men in mazes the stock market may be rallying , but it doesn t seem helping us shape the economy , or the socioeconomic ideologies of tomorrow  a couple of comments on last week s column on president obama s european tour caught my eye toma takes issue with my anglosaxoncentrism  no wonder americans \( apparently of every class and level of education \) so adore the british international without the bother of another language ! so , when you say across the pond , you simply mean in britain , eh \? why are we so myopic in this respect \? for the record , i did cite one dutch blogger more to the point , the opinionator , and this newspaper on the whole , is in english , and i m hardly qualified to read a french newspaper , never mind translate it charles decker points out that  , philip is his royal highness she used to be her royal highness when she was the princess elizabeth to the queen , the opinionator most humbly apologizes for the breach of protocol
akron , ohio with a steady rain falling at firestone country club for most of saturday , of ireland kept his composure and sole possession of the lead for the third straight day in the wgcbridgestone invitational that was the easy part the real job will begin on sunday that is when harrington , who shot a round of 67 for a total of 10underpar 200 , will go headtohead with the unofficial lord of the firestone manor , woods s winning percentage here is an astounding 60 percent 6 victories in 10 appearances and he shot himself into the final pairing with a 65 that put him three strokes behind harrington not until harrington put the finishing touches on his third straight round in the 60s on the 7 , 400yard course did he realize who would be in the final pairing with him he looked up at the big scoreboard next to the 18th green and saw woods s name right below his i was surprised , yeah , harrington said i did n't know he was up there then several thoughts ran through harrington s head , none of them soothing he recreated the internal monologue ok , he s in second place , there he is , seven under par , there you go , threeshot lead , is that enough \? probably not but now i really wish that putt went in on 18' just after missing a 15footer for birdie on his final hole and just before glancing up at the board , harrington had thought he would be paired again with his saturday playing partner , tim clark clark had been tied for the lead or trailing by one or two strokes throughout the day but clark was long gone he dropped from a tie for third place to a tie for 14th after he was assessed a twostroke penalty he neglected to replace his ball to its original position at the 16th hole after moving it out of harrington s line clark called the penalty on himself when he remembered at the 18th hole that he had forgotten to replace his ball at no 16 he mentioned it to a pga tour rules official , who took him to the cbstv trailer to review videotape of the hole clark s round of 71 became a 73 , and he fell seven strokes behind woods , the no 1ranked player in the world , and harrington , ranked 17th , last played in the final pairing of the last round in 2006 , at the dunlop phoenix tournament in japan that day , with six holes to play and defeated him on the second hole of a suddendeath playoff four years before that , harrington held off a charging woods at the target world challenge at sherwood country club in southern california he won by a stroke after starting with an eightshot lead neither of those positive memories made harrington think that sunday would be easy you just do n't know what s going to unfold tomorrow , harrington said but obviously , at this stage , i know it s going to be a difficult day he added i do expect to have a tough day really , from the word go , it s going to be a real tough day just the hype of it all , everything about it , it s just going to be a lot of work tomorrow at the end of the day , there is an intimidation factor there no doubt woods is probably the best frontrunner in the history of golf , with a 361 record when he leads after 54 holes in the 22 times woods has been in second place going into the final round , he has won nine times there is also the fact that woods feels as comfortable at firestone as he does on his yacht , privacy i 've always felt comfortable here , he said there s no doubt you know , this golf course , you 've got to be very patient on this golf course you 've got to really hit your ball well , and if you do , you 're going to give yourself a lot of chances woods took advantage of the chances he had saturday that was the fivestroke difference between his friday round and saturday s he made the putts he had to make and he hit the ball close to the pin on three holes coming in you know , there s just certain golf courses that fit your eye , woods said it s just hard to describe that does n't happen every week , but there s certainly some courses that i feel that way and this is one of them
denver the thickmuscled man with closecropped hair who called himself rick duncan seemed right out of central casting as a prop for a democratic candidate running against bush administration policies last fall a former marine corps captain who suffered brain trauma from a roadside bomb in iraq and was at the pentagon during the sept 11 attacks an advocate for veterans rights who opposed the war an annapolis graduate who was proudly gay with his goldplated credentials , he commanded the respect and attention of not just politicians , but also police chiefs , reporters and veterans advocates for the better part of two years yet , except for his first name , virtually none of his story was true in reality , he was richard g strandlof , a charismatic drifter with a history of mental illness and petty crimes who had moved from montana to nevada to colorado , assuming different names and identities along the way last month , after actual veterans uncovered his deceptions , mr strandlof , 32 , was detained by the federal bureau of investigation and then arrested by the denver police on an outstanding warrant for driving with a suspended license the veterans group he helped create , the colorado veterans alliance , has disbanded and now mr strandlof , apparently penniless , remains in jail on 1 , 000 bail he faces arraignment on tuesday , while the fbi continues an inquiry into whether his subterfuge violated federal laws the tale of how mr strandlof managed to fool so many people for so long says much about the power of veterans in colorado , a swing state with numerous military bases politicians who now shun him were eager to have him by their side a year ago , no questions asked antiwar groups like embraced him as a valued spokesman and real veterans buried doubts about him out of respect , they said , for his alleged service and injuries in an interview at the el paso county jail in colorado springs , mr strandlof did not deny his lies , attributing them to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia , for which he said he had taken medication intermittently for several years politicians were drawn to him , he said , because the veterans population has validity that others do n't but he insisted that he had broken no laws and that his deception was in the service of good causes many former friends , still furious about his betrayal , agree he publicized the plight of homeless veterans , they say , skillfully guided people through the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the veterans affairs department and spoke movingly about posttraumatic stress disorder what s so heartbreaking is he was doing some good things , said hal bidlack , a democrat who ran unsuccessfully for congress from colorado last year on an antiwar platform i just hope he s not undermined the agenda mr bidlack , a retired air force lieutenant colonel , said he met mr strandlof at a poetry reading for veterans and was so impressed that he used him in two campaign commercials it was easy to be deceived by mr strandlof , he said in addition to a scar on his head , which he said was from an improvised explosive device in fallujah , mr strandlof had intimate knowledge of the veterans affairs system , spoke authoritatively about events in iraq and had a knowing bumper sticker on his car that read , got dd214 \? a reference to the discharge papers for armed forces members leaving acting duty in the interview , mr strandlof said he became fascinated with the plight of veterans after meeting a vietnam veteran in nevada several years ago and began obsessively studying the internet and talking to veterans i would ask them , what is your story \? how do you feel \? ' he said over time , he said , the persona of rick duncan emerged and grew stronger with each telling mr strandlof said he had been awed at the impact his story including the posttraumatic stress disorder , or ptsd in military jargon , that he told people he suffered had on veterans when he told it at coffeehouses , meetings and political rallies after arriving in colorado springs in 2006 i would feel a moment of camaraderie that i myself have never experienced in my life , he said there were also things that made mr strandlof seem not credible he never mentioned what unit he served with he claimed to have lost a finger , but had 10 digits minor details of his story would change from week to week we attributed that to his wounds and to his ptsd , and so were all easy on him , said joe barrera , a vietnam veteran whom mr strandlof befriended though mr strandlof did not have a formal role on any campaign , he became a favorite of democratic candidates , appearing at campaign events with jared polis , who won a seat in congress from boulder , and at events for mark udall , a representative subsequently elected to the senate and at least one republican , representative doug lamborn , was taken in by his story in may 2007 , mr strandlof told an aide to mr lamborn that he was forming an advocacy group for younger veterans of the iraq and afghanistan wars the aide , dale anderson , was so impressed that he asked mr strandlof to join the congressman s veterans advisory committee mr strandlof later quit the committee , saying he disagreed with mr lamborn s support for the iraq war , and in the 2008 election backed his opponent , mr bidlack , who lost born in montana , mr strandlof was a bookish , chatty and highly intelligent child who showed no interest in things military , his grandfather , richard k strandlof , said in a telephone interview his father left when he was young and after his mother remarried , his stepfather did not adopt him , deeply hurting mr strandlof , his grandfather said between 1997 and 1999 , he served prison time for forgery and passing bad checks , montana court records show he was briefly released on probation to his grandfather , but after violating the terms by telling him a lie , he was sent back to prison the grandfather said he had not seen him since mr strandlof said he became estranged from his family even earlier , when he came out to them about his sexuality as a teenager after prison , he spent time in california and in reno , nev , where he said he worked at a casino and lived with a man he met on a gay web site that man , jeremy weed , said in an interview that by 2005 mr strandlof was claiming to have served in the military , as well as to have been a graduate of stanford in nevada , mr strandlof , then using his stepfather s name , pierson , was arrested for failure to pay for a rental car his case was handled in a special court for the mentally ill , which allows lowlevel felony charges to be dropped when treatment programs are completed , court records show even as he was in and out of court , mr strandlof was setting up a foundation to bring a grand prix race to the renolake tahoe area the venture failed , but the fbi is now investigating whether mr strandlof kept 25 , 000 said to have been raised for the race mr strandlof says he raised little money and kept none of it for himself his story began to fall apart in recent weeks when he falsely told officials at fort carson that he worked for senator udall the base notified the senator s office of the claim , and aides relayed their concerns to members of the colorado veterans alliance , who harbored their own suspicions some record checking showed that the man they knew as rick duncan had used the name strandlof on a document a call to annapolis determined that he had not attended the naval academy and a check of marine corps records showed that he had never served days after news of his forged identity broke , veterans advocates , congressional aides and elected officials who thought they knew him well remained shocked one veteran was so angry that he created a facebook page urging the justice department to indict mr strandlof many of those people are now wondering what motivated mr strandlof some former friends say it was mental illness but mr weed said it was not so clear cut i think he was excited by the power and the attention he was getting , mr weed said i have a hard time thinking that anyone could care that much about veterans and do them that much harm
seattle this summer , medical students from the took a long look under the hood of the health care system they are about to inherit , and many returned to campus last week with their eyes wide open and their idealism tempered jacob r opfer shadowed a pediatrician in gillette , wyo , who sometimes saw 45 patients a day , allowing little more than five minutes a visit amanda i messinger worked with a family practitioner in kodiak , alaska , who eschewed electronic medical records , leaving staff members to decipher histories from illegible script jens n olsgaard manned a community health center in butte , mont , where four of five patients had no insurance , and treatment was often structured around ability to pay the students learned not only to deliver babies and suture wounds , but also to order unnecessary tests as protection against lawsuits , to hector specialists into seeing patients , to match patients with on walmart s 4 list and they saw firsthand what mr olsgaard called a tidal wave of chronic disease , , , depression that left many questioning how much any one physician could really accomplish i often wondered what we were actually doing to help people , mr olsgaard said not surprisingly , many concluded that it was critical to reorient a reimbursement system that had profoundly devalued primary care and prevention you have to reimburse for primary care , said ms messinger , 24 , who grew up in snohomish , wash you have to reimburse doctors for spending the time to catch things early , to manage chronic things , to be able to offer people treatments they can afford early instead of waiting until there s a catastrophic surgery it s pretty simple for 21 years , the university of washington school of medicine has dispatched its rising secondyear students across the northwest to provide primary care in rural or underserved areas the monthlong is elective , but a record number of students took part this year 117 from a class of 216 the school has a cooperative agreement to train medical students from alaska , idaho , montana and wyoming , none of which has a medical college of its own the summer program is one of several vehicles , along with loan forgiveness enticements , designed to lure students back to their home states to practice in areas with a shortage of primary care givers this year , the students set out as negotiations were intensifying in washington over wholesale changes to the health care system they will soon be joining whether there will be improvements to the system remains to be seen , but few students returned thinking there was little to fix payment policies that leave primary care providers struggling to cover their costs have pushed family practitioners and internists into early retirement , and discouraged newly minted doctors from replacing them to make a living , and chip away at immense educational debt , general practitioners often find they must churn patients and work long , unsatisfying hours the result is that only a third of today s graduates of american train in internal or family medicine , the two largest primary care disciplines , compared with nearly half only 25 years ago , according to the , which matches medical school graduates with residency openings the figure at the university of washington , despite a persistent emphasis on primary care , is only slightly higher for some students , like mr opfer , 23 , their summer experience persuaded them that primary care was not for them the three pediatricians mr opfer followed , who ran the only children s clinic in gillette , filled their 13hour days with hospital rounds and staccato fiveminute appointments , he said one was about to retire because of burnout mr opfer said he thought that the lifestyle would be too harsh to raise a family , and that it would take many years to pay off his anticipated medical school debt of at least 120 , 000 i do n't think you can practice optimal medicine , mr opfer said there is too little incentive after going through all this education and being in school for the majority of your life to want to pursue a career just in primary care other students , like kylie g boggess , 24 , witnessed how integral a federally qualified health center could be to a community like nampa , idaho , and became all the more committed this just sold it to me , ms boggess said you get to have a very personal relationship with your patients you get to know them nonetheless , ms boggess , who is from twin falls , idaho , said she had been struck by how much time was devoted to scavenging resources for patients who had little money i would really like to practice in a world where i can just take care of my patients and that s the end of it , she said , where the big elephant in the room is not whether or not my recommendations mean anything because of cost mr olsgaard , 28 , also found that money drove medical decisions at the community health center where he worked you know the patient , you know the patient s financial information , and then you make clinical decisions based on that , he said ben j ruffatto , 26 , said that after working with a family practitioner in dillon , mont , he had become convinced that rationing health care was a socioeconomic national cultural inevitability it is right now , mr ruffatto said there simply is n't enough money in the system for everyone to get absolutely everything that they want there were differing opinions among the students about critical components of the plans being discussed by president obama and congress , like whether health coverage should be mandated and whether the government should create a public insurance option but even those favoring the democratic approach said they felt momentum had stalled i really like obama , but i'm a little bummed , ms boggess said he has yet to really strongly make the moral argument for providing health care to our citizens some , like elizabeth m stuhlmiller , 25 , who worked in a clinic in tonasket , wash , said they had not paid much attention to the debate , but had learned this summer to take satisfaction in improving the country s health one patient at a time i think i can fill a hole i think that there s a big need , said ms stuhlmiller , who plans to pursue primary care i do n't necessarily have the goals of changing a system to feel at the end of the day that i 've treated a patient and helped them , that would be enough for me
in may the stopandstart hospital sitcom scrubs had what sure looked like its final episode parade of past characters , teary walkoff , blooper reel , production shots of the lead actors doing their series wraps a few weeks later the show got a lastminute reprieve it was renewed for a ninth season , which begins tuesday night on abc with two new episodes it s still called scrubs despite the protests of its creator , bill lawrence , who wanted a new title to indicate how drastically he was changing the show as house has done over the last season and a half , scrubs is significantly remaking its cast , though on a much tighter schedule scene to scene , you can watch the new show emerging from the old sacred heart hospital has been torn down and rebuilt on a university campus , and the returning characters j d \( zach braff \) , turk \( donald faison \) and cox \( john c mcginley \) are on the medical school faculty mr lawrence puts his own words in the mouth of j d , arriving for his first day of classes part of me hates how familiar this seems i hope i can find a way to make this all feel new j d s colleague and baby mama , elliot \( sarah chalke \) , is seven months pregnant the pugnacious nurse carla \( judy reyes \) and the janitor \( neil flynn \) have moved on , though mr flynn gets a funny cameo cox s wife \( christa miller \) is scheduled to return , but she does n't appear in the first two episodes that may be because ms miller , who is mr lawrence s wife in real life , is also a star of his new series cougar town three actors join the fulltime cast as medical students michael mosley , dave franco and , most important , kerry bish her selfconscious , bumbling character , lucy , now shares the voiceover duties with j d , which would seem to mean that ms bish is being groomed to replace mr braff as the show s superego \( mr braff is committed to just six episodes this season \) none of the new regulars make much of an impression in these two episodes for now , their bland sameness outweighs their character tics \( one s neurotic , one s overprivileged , one s a regular guy \) but if you look back eight years , j d and elliot and turk were n't that funny to begin with either it took time for mr lawrence and his writers and actors to define those characters within the fantasy world of sacred heart sitcoms always live and die by their writing , but scrubs stands out for the way that mr lawrence s sense of humor intellectual and lightly surreal but veined with sentimentality is practically the central character in the show , with the progression of oneliners , puns , elaborate jokes and bugeyed tirades substituting for any kind of conventional narrative it s an acquired taste , but the answer to the big question how has this show lasted nine seasons , longer than any other current liveaction sitcom \? is that a hard core of about 6 million viewers has acquired the taste the jokes do n't catch fire in tuesday night s opener , but by the second episode things are starting to click mr mcginley , whose stonefaced rage is the show s surest source of laughs , calls his cowering students you assassins asked how he 'll treat an alcoholic patient , he replies , we 're going to get him out of here and then , hopefully , he s going to die someplace else , like in a yard or somebody s shed he may not be enough to get scrubs to season 10 \( especially with mr flynn gone to the patricia heaton sitcom the middle \) , but it wo n't be for lack of trying created by bill lawrence mr lawrence , josh bycel and jonathan groff , executive producers produced by abc studios with zach braff \( j d \) , donald faison \( chris turk \) , john c mcginley \( perry cox \) , eliza coupe \( denise \) , kerry bish \( lucy \) , michael mosley \( drew \) and dave franco \( cole \)
the names of jos guzman and greg hibbard are mostly lost to baseball history in 1993 , they combined to win 27 games for the fourthplace chicago cubs two years later , they were out of baseball for good in that 1993 season , guzman and hibbard together earned about 5 million greg maddux , whom the cubs had allowed to leave as a free agent , earned 5875 million for the atlanta braves maddux won the national league cy young award that season and the next and the next and now has the most wins of any pitcher alive scott boras was maddux s agent ned colletti was an official in the cubs' baseball operations department though , as he said last week in a telephone interview , it was not his decision to let maddux leave boras and colletti are locked in another showdown over , as the face a decision similar to the cubs' with maddux as the general manager of the dodgers , colletti traded for ram rez last july and watched him hit 410 over 61 games , including eight in october yet ram rez is still unsigned after rejecting the dodgers' oneyear , 25 million proposal last week with spring training nearly upon them , the dodgers' question is whether to raise their ram rez offer or spread the money around to several free agents with so many good players still looking for work including outfielders bobby abreu and adam dunn and second baseman orlando hudson colletti has options he signed starter randy wolf on friday but said the dodgers' priority was still to sign ram rez we 're continuing to talk to the other players' agents to know what our other options are , colletti said at the same time , we need to be sure manny does n't want to play for the dodgers and that we 're not going to make a deal when we know it s time to go , we 'll go boras s position is clear he has long used the maddux precedent as a reason teams should keep elite players instead of using the same money to fill multiple holes and , he said , ram rez is prepared to wait for the right offer talent does n't have a wristwatch , boras said boras is well known for protracted negotiations , but he has often secured lucrative deals with much greater ease the dodgers have been especially eager to sign his clients , no matter their ownership fox group spent wildly for pitchers kevin brown and darren dreifort , and frank mccourt has enriched outfielders j d drew and andruw jones none of those deals worked as the dodgers hoped , but ram rez has proved his value with his staggering production late last season even in his stormy final month in boston , when he forced a trade from the team he led to two titles , ram rez hit 347 he draws fans to the ballpark and captivates them on television this is not someone you add to your payroll , boras said this is someone who pays for himself ram rez is a free agent because he and boras required the dodgers to drop his two option years , at 20 million each , before accepting the trade from the red sox there was reason to be confident that ram rez could command more on the open market , even though he turns 37 in may the dodgers started negotiations with an offer of 45 million for two years , with a 15 million option for 2011 boras ignored that proposal , but it remains the largest reported offer ram rez has received the mets , the yankees , the los angeles angels and the washington nationals have insisted they are not interested in him besides the dodgers , who continue to negotiate with boras , only the san francisco giants are known to be involved one major league official , who was granted anonymity so he could speak candidly about another team , said he was baffled that the giants' new owner , william h neukom , had not pursued ram rez more aggressively neukom wants to make a statement , the official said they must have money because they were talking about c c sabathia , and they know the effect of a great hitter from having barry bonds plus , they could hurt la and win the west you ca n't rule them out boras has used competing bids effectively this winter , steering pitcher derek lowe to atlanta for 60 million over four years and first baseman mark teixeira to the yankees for 180 million over eight years but there seems to be nothing to spur the dodgers all you can do is look at the other teams and see if their outfield is set , colletti said or , if it s an american league team , are they looking for a dh \? and you try to guess how deep they 'd be willing to go boras knows precisely what the teixeira bidders offered in that negotiation , and he could be waiting for one of those teams to shift attention to ram rez but that has not happened yet , even from the angels , who need a big bat and revel in tweaking the dodgers angels manager mike scioscia praised ram rez in a december radio interview , but he is perceived as being a bad match with a combustible star in his stormy exit from boston , ram rez had a physical altercation with the traveling secretary , complained of a knee injury the team disputed and took three strikes against mariano rivera in a sleepwalking role as a pinchhitter that s not mike scioscia s kind of guy , said one general manager , whose team is not interested in ram rez the biggest thing about manny in boston is they did n't know if he was going to play nothing is worse for a manager the guy is the greatest righthanded hitter we 've ever seen , but he s a time bomb why do it if they have alternatives \? that is the question the dodgers are debating at stake is the balance of power in the national league west , and the future home of a prodigious hitter
london was it something in the air \? was it something in the food \? was it some unspeakable organism lurking evilly on a countertop or skulking under a plate \? whatever it was , it has caused hundreds of people in the past month to report becoming violently sick with projectile vomiting , sudden diarrhea and flulike symptoms after eating at the in bray , berkshire the fat duck , which has three michelin stars and is perhaps britain s most celebrated restaurant , has closed the outbreak s cause remains a mystery britain s health protection agency said it was testing the food , testing the people who had become ill and conducting a risk assessment of all food storage , preparation and cooking processes it is testing for bacteria , viruses , patterns in the sick people s symptoms and in the food they ate and , for good measure , testing other diners , whether or not they got sick they 're looking for a bug , said phillip bicknell , a local government official , something that s causing the sickness , that may well be attached to the restaurant , inside or outside , or to the staff who work there , or to a customer who came in the restaurant s reopening depends on when the testing is completed the restaurant s owner , the celebrity chef , decided to close it on feb 24 after about 40 diners said they had become ill after eating there as news of the outbreak has spread , about 400 people in all have reported being sickened from late january through most of february mr blumenthal declined to comment but a spokeswoman said that none of the tests had so far proved conclusive the british news media have speculated that mr blumenthal could be losing as much as 140 , 000 a week , merely in lost reservations a regular dinner at this small restaurant in the country costs about 140 , without wine the tasting menu costs about 185 mr blumenthal said last week that he felt dreadful , absolutely dreadful , and that closing the restaurant had been an incredibly emotional decision , reported the fat duck is considered one of the world s most innovative practitioners of molecular gastronomy , which uses science and technology to invent new forms and combinations of food \( mr blumenthal prefers the term sensory design \) although his menu includes semiconventional dishes , mr blumenthal is perhaps best known for items like snail porridge and nitroscrambled egg and bacon \( served with tea jelly \) his sound of the sea dish includes seafood , foam and what some reviewers have called edible sand it is served alongside a conch shell with an ipod in it , so diners can listen to wave and seagull sounds as they eat mr blumenthal is known for professionalism and meticulous attention to detail he told the bbc that the restaurant regularly conducted its own tests everything is tested , from the food coming out of the ground , from the farm , into the kitchen and to the customer , he said he also owns a pub in bray , but no one has gotten sick there , said mr bicknell , the local official richard harden , the coeditor of in london , said he could not think of a similar case in 18 years of following the restaurant industry but like many others , he speculated that the diners might have come down with , a highly contagious type of , or norwalklike virus , that has been cutting a swath through britain it has been particularly virulent in schools and hospitals dr steve field , chairman of the royal college of general practitioners , said that the reported symptoms seemed more in line with the vomiting illness than with , say , food poisoning if just one person in the restaurant had it , he said , it could have been passed quickly to everyone else mr bicknell said that funnily enough , i had this sickness and diarrhea last weekend , and the last time i ate at the fat duck was about five years ago he added i ca n't speculate , and at the end of the day the tests will show the answer one way or another but if you want to suggest that my symptoms are the same as those being reported , that would have an element of truth in it
health authorities and drug companies say that supplies are generally ample for the two drugs that would be vital to treating a pandemic caused by swine flu , but that they are acting to prevent hoarding some pharmacies in the united states and some other countries have run out of the drugs , in part because of strong demand from consumers who are not sick but want to have them just in case glaxosmithkline is now allocating supplies of its drug , relenza , to areas of the united states or the world most in need of it , a spokesman for the company said in france , where there was a run on tamiflu in pharmacies , roche , which makes the drug , has stopped supplying it to drugstores to preserve supplies for hospitals health authorities and the manufacturers say that the supply of the two drugs is best in countries that have built stockpiles in the last few years in preparation for a possible pandemic there are no reports , and we do n't expect any reports , of shortages of antivirals in any states , dr richard besser , the acting director of the centers for disease control and prevention , said thursday at a news conference the federal government has a stockpile with enough medicine to treat 50 million people some 11 million of those treatments are now being sent to the states , some of which are carefully guarding the stocks in secret locations the government is also sending 400 , 000 treatments to mexico , which has been hardest hit by the flu strain the united states government has already ordered 13 million new treatments to replenish the american stockpile the evidence that the drugs work against the new strain of virus has come only from laboratory tests , but those are generally very accurate , said nancy j cox , director of the influenza division at the federal disease control agency to see how the drugs work in practice , researchers will have to compare how treated and untreated patients fare retail supplies are handled separately from the federal stockpile , and those supplies are stretched thinner , with pharmacies in parts of the country reporting spot shortages , making it difficult for some people who actually have the flu to get the drug malcolm smith , the majority leader in the new york state senate , said friday that he had to go to four pharmacies to obtain tamiflu for his daughter , who is suffering from influenza , though it is not clear yet if it is the new strain tamiflu , which is a capsule , is much more popular than relenza , which is inhaled the number of daily prescriptions for the antiflu drugs shot up this week to nine times the level earlier in april , according to sdi , a company that tracks prescriptions rolan shlain , a pharmacist at this way pharmacy in brooklyn , said he filled 24 prescriptions for tamiflu on wednesday none of those customers , he said , had symptoms they said they just wanted it , he said the personal stockpiling worries some experts because in a pandemic it could deprive those who really need the drugs we are concerned about doctors irresponsibly prescribing the drugs , dr thomas r frieden , the health commissioner of new york city , said thursday but not all physicians are caving to pressure even my husband wanted it , and i said no , said dr dorothy levine , a pediatrician in stamford , conn an even bigger concern could be hoarding on a larger scale , perhaps by distributors or hospitals that would buy more medicine than they need , in hopes of reselling it later for a much higher price if a shortage worsened richard demers , director of pharmacy at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania , said wholesalers and roche were being careful to monitor big orders if you 're ordering an exorbitant amount , you get a call from the wholesalers , he said even the federal supplies could be overwhelmed in a pandemic the government has enough doses to treat the number of people expected to get sick but an additional 109 million doses twice the amount in the stockpile would be needed to prevent health care and other essential workers from getting sick the federal pandemic plan called for hospitals and other institutions to buy these on their own , but few did , said kim elliott , deputy director of trust for america s health , a public health advocacy organization roche and glaxosmithkline are ramping up production they are trying to avoid the pressure they got a few years ago when fears of a pandemic were stoked by bird flu back then , some countries threatened to override the patents on tamiflu and produce the drug themselves glaxo said friday that it had six million relenza treatments in stock it said it would increase production to five million treatments a month , though it would take 12 to 14 weeks to achieve that level roche has the capacity to produce 400 million treatment courses a year worldwide , with 80 million of them manufactured in the united states it has not said publicly how much it now produces
determining whether a team has moved the football the required 10 yards for a first down takes speed , choreography and precision and two sticks with a chain between them the nfl s chain gang is actually a sevenperson crew , hired for gameday duty by the home teams four people work on one side of the field , where the chains are , under the direction of the head linesman , an onfield official dressed in the familiar blackandwhitestriped shirt a threeperson auxiliary crew works the other side , without chains , mostly as a backup system and to provide approximate downanddistance indicators for that side of the field the two crews flip sides of the field at halftime wearing blackandyellowstriped bibs , two people hold the chains a third person , a box man wearing a red bib , marks the approximate spot of the ball after each play with a down marker \( the term box man refers to a cube that once sat atop the marker and was rotated after each play to reflect the down today , a dial flips the numbers , 1 through 4 \) on first downs , the box man estimates the spot , using the ball placed on the field or the foot of a side judge as a gauge one end of the chains is placed on the same spot , the other stretched 10 yards upfield a fourth crew member fastens a clip to the chain to denote the nearest 5yard increment on the field if a team has a first down on its 27yard line , for example , the clip is placed at the 30yard line the clip has two functions first , it indicates where the chains should be put back if they are jostled off their settings second , during a measurement on the field , it tells the officials where the chains should be placed of course , each placement of the ball , of the chains , of the clip is an estimation performed by the naked eye precision is made more difficult because the chains and the markers sit six feet beyond the sideline six feet away from any yard line on the field and at least 76 feet away from the nearest start of the next play , on the nearest hash mark accuracy may be further compromised by unpredictable elements , ranging from bad weather , a pocked field and a hasty lastminute drive that leaves the chain gang scrambling to get into place before the ball is snapped then again , while plenty of games are famously remembered for results caused by poor officiating , none are recalled for the sloppy work of the chain gang whenever there is a questionable spot on a key play , the debate is over the position of the ball not the position of the chains the chains , it seems , are viewed as accurate arbiters of distance , just as they have been for more than 100 years the nfl declined to allow members of chain crews to be interviewed , or for a reporter to be on the sideline of a game to observe how the crew and the officials spot the ball and the markers during a game
just about everybody usa today has tracked each nfl team s interest in vick the speculation has almost become a sport in itself most teams have said no \( only the cardinals and the texans have not made a public comment \) packers general manager ted thompson wouldn t rule out signing him , inviting speculation that green bay was a possible destination the wisconsin state journal the nfl s smallest market might provide the perfect setting for vick s comeback , allowing him to focus solely on football but the packers president , mark murphy , quickly played down that possibility kevin blackistone , fanhouse i am not comfortable with the fact that none of the 32 franchises that make up the nfl have sought thus far to bring in even for a quick looksee a player who when we last saw him in 2006 was considered so talented that he was the league s highestpaid player brian burke of advanced nfl stats wrote a post for the fifth down recently saying that vick is a better quarterback than you think but that s football , and this is well beyond football scott soshnick of bloomberg news said that interviews with coaches won t reveal which franchise will take that chance excerpt forget football think finance you re better off polling chief marketing officers they re the ones in contact with corporate partners , who , as greg bibb , chief operating officer of the wnba s washington mystics says , are counted on for what s a small and getting smaller pool of dollars think of a professional sports team as a human heart there are three main arteries , or revenue streams the first is television that money is guaranteed vick or no vick the second is tickets and suites , most of which are already sold for this season that leaves sponsorship , which is where things get iffy far from shunning him , wayne pacelle of the humane society says that vick , by reaching young people , can be useful in curbing dogfighting with tens of thousands of people involved in dogfighting , in hundreds of communities , it is impossible for us and law enforcement to arrest or scare off all of the perpetrators we have to prevent them from getting involved in the first place , and build community support for our position extra point where does vick belong \? \( feel free to interpret that question as you wish \)
the accounts of justice david souter s life as he prepares to leave the supreme court show that he is slipping away to history s judgment in the same way he was introduced a bubble or two offplumb , as they say in yankee carpentry circles souter s been painted as a strange , little man stranded in the wrong century , unsociable in the livealonewithyourcat sort of way he eats a solo lunch at his desk every day , the same lunch , an apple and yogurt and , talk about new england gothic he eats the apple through to the core ! at his 200yearold family farmhouse badly in need of a paint job , as numerous observers have noted he has no email access , no answering machine , a television that s never been plugged in and , strangest of all he s leaving one of the most powerful positions on earth because he wants more time to hike in his beloved new hampshire mountains to many , this last assertion is proof of his advanced eccentricity but let s give him his due anyone who has climbed every one of new hampshire s 4 , 000foot peaks , as the springy 69yearold souter reportedly has done , knows a kind of exhilaration that his blackrobed colleagues in the tidal basin will never know how strange is it , really , to want another taste of the savage winds atop mount washington before the knees go bad \? earlier this month , souter showed a flash of regional chauvinism on the issue closest to his heart when he said there was no good hiking south of massachusetts he then described a dream he s had every day since he announced his decision to step down he is standing atop the highest point of new hampshire , above timberline and looking down at the path from which he came now consider souter s polar opposite on the court , in manner and philosophy , the evercombustible justice antonin scalia a father of nine talk about a 19thcentury man nino scalia s idea of a fantasy getaway involves dick cheney as a bunkmate in a fortress stocked with singlemalts scalia , remember , rode with vice president cheney on air force two to a hunting excursion in 2004 that had all the trappings of clueless british royalty on holiday , complete with ground travel to prey in armored suv s and sycophants at every turn who all but tracked birds by radar it rained over several days and the ducks were scarce , giving scalia much time to get to know the central figure in a secrecy case he would soon help to decide little wonder that former justice sandra day o connor dismissed stories of scalia with the kind of shorthand families use for the daft uncle that s just nino or how about clarence thomas \? he gained 100 pounds after getting his lifetenured easy chair on the court and accepts more gifts than anyone else on the bench , according to jeffrey toobin s book , the nine by contrast , the ascetic souter consistently listed none on the court s annual gift and travel disclaimer form but woe to the public man who fails to maintain his own spin , leaving professional character assassins to the job david souter s a girl , said rush limbaugh in 2006 everyone knows that what s the big deal \? i m talking about attitudinally here , folks ok , a show of hands who s the bigger man the prescriptiondrug abuser with the cigar stuffed in his mouth , or the buff older gentleman puffing his way up one of the more strenuous climbs in new england \? souter is not the first supreme court justice to claim love of mountain trails over legal aerobics justice william o douglas , no stranger to life outside the bounds of conformity , was never happier than when he was home in goose prairie , wash , near the lateafternoon shadow of mount rainier he once made a visitor , justice william rehnquist , hike up an 8 , 000foot peak \( these are western mountains , pardner , cloudscrapers \) , before he d give him an evening cocktail and in 1970 , douglas was deep in the cascade mountain wilderness when he was approached by three lawyers in business suits seeking a temporary restraining order douglas sent them away , with advice on proper outdoor wear he left his decision , the following morning , in a tree trunk their request was denied \( that part of the cascades is now formally called the william o douglas wilderness , a splendid slice of high country \) president obama said he wants souter s replacement to have some empathy with average people , an observation that sent his critics into a codedeciphering lather but souter s example shows another quality that a justice should have a sense of balance between the hothouse of washington and the cooler air of the outdoors souter relies on the new hampshire wild for restoration , he said , a sentiment shared by thomas jefferson say what you will about his legal rulings and his backing of a decision that allows cities to condemn private property in order to get a higher tax base was a clunker that he should regret but souter s lifestyle , at the least , is close to original intent
jerusalem s security cabinet voted wednesday to make the opening of israel s border crossings with , a central demand for any longterm ceasefire arrangement , conditional on the release of an israeli soldier held by hamas the cabinet decision , widely seen as a hardening of the israeli stance , seemed to dim the prospects for a quick conclusion to the egyptianbrokered talks for a consolidated truce but the unanimous vote merely formalized the position that was being articulated with increasing clarity in recent days by the israeli prime minister , ehud olmert , and seemed more focused on expediting a prisoner exchange deal with hamas for the soldier s return hamas , the militant islamic group that controls gaza , is demanding the release of as many as 1 , 400 security prisoners in israeli jails in return for the captive soldier , cpl he was seized in a crossborder raid and taken into gaza by hamas and other militant groups in june 2006 a government statement released after the fivehour cabinet meeting said the release of the soldier was a top priority for israel and would entail the release of palestinian prisoners significantly , the statement omitted any reference to a longstanding cabinet decision barring the release of palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands , meaning those convicted of planning or perpetrating attacks in which israelis had died hamas has demanded the release of many such prisoners in return for corporal shalit we want to see this over , said mark regev , a spokesman for mr olmert , in reference to the shalit case we are willing to pay a difficult price mr regev said specific numbers of prisoners had been discussed in the cabinet meeting , as well as some specific names , so that the ministers fully understood what was involved but a final list of prisoners has yet to be agreed on , he said hamas has rejected any link between an opening of the crossings as part of a ceasefire and a deal to release corporal shalit fawzi barhoum , a hamas spokesman in gaza , said the israeli position imposes new conditions at the last minute this completely contradicts the egyptian and palestinian positions , he continued in a statement , and he accused israel of blackmail he added that hamas had no objection to releasing the israeli soldier if israel met his group s demands for a prisoner exchange this week , s president , , also rejected any direct link between the truce and the release of corporal shalit but meir sheetrit , the israeli interior minister , who attended wednesday s cabinet meeting , told reporters afterward that israel cannot come to any agreement with hamas or egypt without solving the issue of gilad shalit egypt has been brokering talks for a longterm truce since israel ended its 22day war against hamas in gaza a month ago hamas is demanding open border crossings and a lifting of the economic embargo that israel has imposed on gaza since the militant group took over the area in 2007 israel demands an end to rocket and mortar fire by gaza militants against population centers in southern israel , and a halt to weapons smuggling by hamas in the meantime , the israeli security cabinet said it would allow only partial activities at the crossings to supply the immediate and basic humanitarian needs of the palestinian population human rights organizations and some foreign officials have denounced the policy as collective punishment the recent sharpening of israel s position has caused tension inside the country , too amos gilad , the israeli defense ministry s liaison in talks with the egyptians , was quoted in the newspaper maariv on wednesday as having told an associate that israel was risking its relations with egypt i do n't understand what it is that they 're trying to do , mr gilad was quoted as saying about the israeli government to insult the egyptians \? we 've already insulted them it s madness it s simply madness egypt has remained almost our last ally here an israeli government official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly on the dispute , said mr olmert had called mr gilad in and reprimanded him for his remarks , none of which mr gilad denied in gaza , unexploded ordnance left behind by the israelis has disappeared from a storage site that was guarded by the hamas police , united nations officials and hamas police representatives said on wednesday the missing ordnance , including bombs dropped from israeli warplanes , was awaiting safe disposal by a team working with the united nations united nations officials have been circumspect in blaming any specific party for the disappearance of the bombs , but israel has pointed a finger at hamas a hamas police officer said the ordnance disappeared when those guarding the site were obliged to evacuate their positions after they heard remotely piloted israeli drones in the sky he said the bombs could have been stolen by fighters , but we are still investigating mark buswell , the technical director of the group working to clear the unexploded ordnance , said it was the hamas police who first brought in the weapons , which included two guided missiles and powerful aerial bombs on wednesday , israel s president , , began consultations with the political parties recently elected to parliament to determine which one should form the next governing coalition the centrist kadima party , led by foreign minister , narrowly won 28 seats in the 120seat parliament the more conservative likud party , led by , won 27 seats , but has broader support in parliament both ms livni and mr netanyahu have claimed victory and the right to lead the next government mr peres is likely to choose the party leader with the best chance of forming a coalition most analysts believe that would be mr netanyahu
american stories paintings of everyday life , 17651915 is a wild ride it fills nine galleries at the with 103 paintings that the museum calls iconic generally the claim is justified as it trundles through 150 crucial years of american life and art , the show , which opened on monday , provides glimpses of great chunks of history the fight for independence , the settling of the west , the tragedy of slavery and the immigrantfilled tenements of the lower east side to one side are numerous prominent landmarks of american painting watson and the shark , s tumult of water and flesh s little girl in a blue armchair , with its deft , psychologically subtle impressionism and s snapshotlike croquet scene perhaps most iconic of all is george caleb bingham s jolly flatboatmen , a dynamic opposition of inanimate horizontals and quite animated humans to the other side are unfamiliar gems of genre painting like john greenwood s comic sea captains carousing in surinam , which borrows liberally from hogarth and christian friedrich mayr s kitchen ball at white sulphur springs , virginia , an antebellum depiction of a black wedding celebration that is remarkably free of condescension or caricature and down the middle are scores of less gemlike genre paintings , full of plots and props and stilted emotions american stories has been organized by h barbara weinberg , the met s curator of american paintings and sculpture , and carrie rebora barratt , its associate director of collections and administration , in association with bruce robertson , a consulting curator at the los angeles county museum of art , and margaret c conrads , a curator at the nelsonatkins museum of art in kansas city , mo the show s title declares their intentions in very specific terms this is an exhibition of paintings that tell stories about americans and their country the work is exclusively figurative , limited to portraits of people and depictions of events real or plausible , hence no mythological or religious subjects , fantasies or landscapes in addition all the artists are trained to some extent , hence no folk art or limner portraits nevertheless the curators have cultivated a large and manysplendored agenda that often has a mind of its own section titles like stories for the public , 18301860 , stories of war and reconciliation , 18601877 and cosmopolitan and candid stories , 18771915 have a onesizefitsall feeling on the walls organizing principles flit among period , style , none of the above or brown , given the preponderance of darkish genre paintings in certain galleries \( where dark red walls do n't help \) the wall texts pinpoint more subtle themes the emergence of an artbuying middle class that was less interested in patrician portraits than in portrayals , however idealized or glossed over , of their daily lives the national trauma of the civil war , which intensified the desire for this idealization and the degree to which this trauma came across anyway , especially in paintings that touch on race in this context the impressionism of cassatt and provides aesthetic relief , but also comes across as a double avoidance since it presents beguiling images in a european style in a sense this exhibition is a pitched battle about how painting should tell stories in a country whose history was unfolding at high speed and whose narrative was not quite like anything the world had even seen in many instances you may be pulled into the intricacies of a genre painting s worldview purely for its anthropological richness and psychological confusion eastman johnson s elaborate , rembrandtesque negro life at the south , for example , centers on a black banjo player surrounded by small groups of figures who seem to have wandered onstage to act out courtship , motherhood and , in the case of a girl intently reading a book , intellectual curiosity , while a white woman , surprised and impressed , peeks in from the wings elsewhere not even anthropology redeems the sweet , contrived narratives of the paintings gossip is exchanged , war news is shared , cakes are baked , new bonnets are paraded before budgetminded husbands , nuclear families assume stereotypical roles in cluttered drawing rooms simple light and space are mostly absent the results are formally cramped , emotionally manipulative and drab , even while they illuminate the wellspring of norman rockwell s hackneyed art against all this , works by cassatt , homer , bingham , thomas eakins , william sidney mount and george bellows

depicts a majestic black woman standing in a skiff , teaching a white boy how to fend for himself it also reveals an intimate emotional bond while signifying a larger codependency that was and to a great extent remains corrosive in both directions at times the curators emphasize the works' contrasts the fifth gallery opens with homer s dressing for the carnival , a patchwork of deep shadows and bright colors that accords a black family a striking solemnity that feels completely contemporary in body language and mood next to it , theodor kaufmann s on to liberty depicts fugitive slave women

seoul , south korea north korean threats and weapons tests followed by americanled sanctions and shortlived deals have become an alltoofamiliar pattern in the world s response to with the security council having , the question is whether there are real pressure points that even the hermetic north korean government will respond to or is this all just window dressing \? in the newest round of sanctions after , the united states and allies like japan and south korea have brought back measures , such as freezing the north s overseas bank accounts , that seemed most painful to the government in the past diplomats call the new sanctions , which also include highseas searches of north korean ships for unconventional weapons , potentially some of the most potent yet aimed at but russia and china resisted calls to make them mandatory , so it remains unclear how great an impact they will have but mandatory or not , many analysts and former diplomats questioned whether any sanctions regime would ever have enough bite to break the cycle sanctions wo n't bring north korea to its knees , said kim keunsik , a specialist on north korea at kyungnam university in seoul the north knows this very well , from having lived with economic sanctions of one sort or another for the past 60 years most analysts agree that the most effective measures are those that target the lifestyle of north korean leaders financial sanctions aimed at ending all banking transactions related to north korea s weapons trade , and halting most grants and loans this would effectively freeze many of the north s overseas bank accounts , cutting off the funds that north korean leader has used to secure the cognac , swiss watches and other luxury items needed to buy the loyalty of his country s elites the united states has also accused the north of using such offshore accounts to launder counterfeited dollars and for narcotics trafficking , criminal activities that the treasury department estimates earn the government as much as 700 million annually in hard currency a similar tactic was tried in 2005 , when 25 million in north korean accounts was frozen at banco delta asia , an obscure institution in the chinese territory of macao to the surprise of many at the time , the measure brought howls of protest from north korea the sanctions against bda hit the regime where it hurts , said lee sanghyun , a north korea specialist at the , a private research institute , using the bank s abbreviation however , some analysts and former officials here blame the financial sanctions for having the opposite effect , provoking the north and hardening its resolve some link the bda sanctions to the north s first nuclear test , which came just a year later , in october 2006 the sanctions against bda hurt , but in the end did they work \? no , the north responded by just spitting in america s face with the nuclear test , said jeong sehyun , who as unification minister was one of the south s top negotiators with north korea during the administrations of former presidents kim daejung and roh moohyun , who were often at odds with washington over pressure on north korea this time , in addition to financial sanctions , the proposed security council resolution calls for a tighter arms embargo , possible interdiction of north korean vessels but most analysts say that none of the threats are large enough to stop a government that sees as the key to its survival , and that has endured decades of economic sanctions and hardships , including even starvation , rather than capitulate to outside pressure these are people who did n't flinch even when 2 million of their own people died of hunger , said lee jisue , a north korea specialist at myongji university and that is assuming that the sanctions are fully enforced while many of these same measures have been included in previous united nations resolutions , nations like china and russia were reluctant to enforce them to avoid antagonizing the north critics and proponents alike agree that the linchpin in making any sanctions work is china , north korea s primary aid and trade partner china shares an 850mile border with north korea , and its 2 billion annual trade with the north accounts for over 40 percent of north korea s entire external trade , according to south korean government estimates north korea s trade with china expanded by 23 percent just last year , the south korean government said both united states and south korean officials fear that although beijing was disappointed by the north s continued tests , it remains reluctant to push too hard they say china fears causing a collapse of the north korean government that could flood it with refugees and create a newly unified , proamerican korea on its border it remains to be seen whether beijing or even washington would have the stomach to enforce some of the proposed sanctions , such as interdicting north korean ships north korea has proclaimed that it would regard any such search as an act of war the sanctions will have a bite , but i'm not sure if it will be painful enough to change north korean policy , said wi sunglac , the foreign ministry s top negotiator with north korea what we need on top of the sanctions is a united approach by the key players to enforce them in the end , what is needed to convince the north to give up its nuclear weapons , say many analysts and diplomats , is a grand bargain of sweeping incentives that could include largescale economic aid , normalization of relations with the united states and pledges that washington will not attack or topple the north korean government we need big enough carrots to go along with a stronger stick , said yun dukmin , a north korea specialist at the institute of foreign affairs and national security , a government research institute that is the only hope for breaking out of this cycle
cleveland \( ap \) the badly decomposed bodies of six women were found at the home of a convicted rapist last week , all victims of homicide , the coroner s office said sunday at least five of the women seemed to have been strangled , said powell caesar , a spokesman for the cuyahoga county coroner decomposition made it difficult to determine how the sixth died , he said the bodies could have been there anywhere from weeks to months to years , mr caesar said none of the victims had been identified , mr caesar said two of the women were black , but the race of the others had not been determined , he said the convicted rapist , anthony sowell , a 50yearold registered sex offender , was arrested saturday when officers spotted him walking down the street of his eastside neighborhood court records and jail officials had no information about whether he had a lawyer no charges had been filed regarding the bodies the gruesome discovery left some in the community concerned about women whom they had not seen in a long time ida garrett , 72 , remembered a friend who was reported missing in april i think one of them is her , ms garrett said the first bodies were found thursday night when police went to mr sowell s home to arrest him on charges of rape and felonious assault related to a september attack he was not there the woman who reported that attack survived mr sowell spent 15 years in prison for choking and raping a 21yearold woman who was lured to his bedroom in 1989 , the police said as a registered sex offender , mr sowell was required to check in regularly at the sheriff s office , which said he complied officers also visited his home , most recently on sept 22 , hours before the woman reported being raped there but since mr sowell was not on parole or probation , they did not have the right to enter his house until thursday , when they had search and arrest warrants the threestory house with neat white siding is in a crowded innercity neighborhood of mostly older homes , some boarded up , and small corner stores the windows of the third floor , where the first two bodies were found , were wide open sunday as a slight breeze blew some neighbors said a bad smell came from the house several months ago , but they thought then that it might be natural gas ms garrett , the neighbor , walked to church services sunday just one block from mr sowell s home she said neighbors were relieved by the arrest but worried about those missing , including her friend , nancy cobbs , who disappeared six months ago

anaheim , calif the episcopal church voted overwhelmingly tuesday to open the door to consecrate more bishops who are openly gay , a move that is likely to send shock waves throughout the , the global network of churches to which the episcopal church belongs by voting to affirm that any ordained ministry is open to gay men and lesbians , the episcopal church effectively ended what many regarded as a moratorium on ordaining gay bishops , which the church passed at its last convention three years ago the moratorium was adopted in what proved to be a largely unsuccessful effort to calm conservatives in the anglican communion , which has torn itself apart in the last six years since the episcopal diocese of new hampshire elected the communion s first and only openly gay bishop , bishop v gene robinson the battle over homosexuality in the episcopal church has been watched closely by other mainline protestant churches they are looking to the episcopal church as a bellwether that could foretell whether their denominations can survive the storm over homosexuality intact many delegates to the church s convention here characterized the action not as an overturning of the moratorium , but as simply an honest assertion of who we are they note that the church , which claims about two million members , has hundreds of openly gay laypeople , priests and deacons , and that its democratic decisionmaking structures are charged with deciding who merits ordination it s not an attempt to fly in the face of the anglican communion , said bonnie anderson , who as president of the house of deputies , which represents laypeople and clergy members , is one of the church s two top officers it s an attempt to deepen relationships with the rest of the communion , because real relationships are built on authenticity but some at the convention warned that the episcopal church could pay a price for snubbing its global partners the rev shannon s johnston , coadjutor bishop of the diocese of virginia , who will take office as bishop on oct 1 , said in an interview that he voted against it because i thought we would be seen as uncooperative and not a team player in the anglican communion zack brown , a youth delegate from the diocese of upper south carolina , begged the house of deputies just before their final vote , please do n't vote in a way that makes more conservatives feel the way i do now like i'm the only one left the vote in the houses of bishops and deputies was more than twothirds in favor and onethird opposed or abstaining the house of bishops also took up a measure that would create a liturgy to bless samesex couples such blessings are already being done in many dioceses , without official sanction it is time for our church to be liberated from the hypocrisy under which it has been laboring , bishop stacy sauls of lexington , ky , told his fellow bishops on tuesday the episcopal church acted despite a personal address at the start of the convention from the archbishop of canterbury , rowan williams , who as head of the church of england is considered first among equals among the communion s archbishops along with many in the communion , the archbishop said , i hope and pray that there wo n't be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart passed tuesday was written in a way that would allow dioceses to consider gay candidates to the episcopacy , but does not mandate that all dioceses do so it also emphasizes that the episcopal church has an abiding commitment to the anglican communion it says that many gay men and lesbians are already ministering in the church and that god has called and may call such individuals , to any ordained ministry in the episcopal church , and that god s call to the ordained ministry in the episcopal church is a mystery which the church attempts to discern for all people through our discernment processes acting in accordance with the constitution and canons of the episcopal church pamela reamer williams , a spokeswoman for integrity usa , an advocacy group for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender members of the church , said the church has stated very clearly that all levels of the ministry in the episcopal church are open to the lgbt baptized it is a change in the sense that it supersedes the effective moratorium conservative provinces in the anglican communion , especially some in africa , broke their ties with the episcopal church after it consecrated bishop robinson the moratorium adopted three years ago urged episcopal dioceses to restrain from consecrating bishops whose manner of life posed a challenge to the rest of the anglican communion in fact , a few openly gay candidates were considered for election in the last three years , but none won sufficient support , and the moratorium was never tested in the end , the moratorium pleased no one neither conservatives who observed that some in the church did not really intend to abide by it , nor liberals who saw it as a codification of discrimination and injustice to gay clergy members who otherwise were qualified to be considered as bishops the moratorium also did little to forestall the fracturing both within the episcopal church and in the anglican communion conservatives in both bodies have formed their own alliances in the last three years , asserting that they represent the true anglican tradition in the united states , four dioceses fort worth pittsburgh quincy , ill and san joaquin , calif have voted to split from the episcopal church \( although some parishes within those dioceses elected to remain \) last year , they joined with other disaffected parishes and groups that had splintered from the episcopal church over many years to form the anglican church in north america that group held its first convention , in texas , last month they claim 100 , 000 members the new group says that scripture clearly prohibits homosexual relationships church liberals , meanwhile , insist that the anglican tent is large enough to tolerate multiple approaches the debates at the convention in anaheim over the last few days have made it clear that the liberals increasingly have the upper hand within the episcopal church at a debate over whether to develop formal rites for samesex weddings , 50 people testified in favor and 6 against it s a clean sweep for the liberal agenda in the episcopal church , said david virtue , editor of , a conservative web site the orthodox are finished
bates city , mo on a deadend dirt road , through frosted crops and bales of hay in this sleepy town about a halfhour east of kansas city , state investigators spent much of last week excavating the yard around a farmhouse , looking for decadesold evidence of sex crimes against children their search was prompted , law enforcement officials say , by a 26yearold woman who went to the police in nearby independence , mo , in august and accused her grandfather , father and three uncles of sexually abusing her and her siblings as children , beginning in the winter of 1988 and continuing for seven years according to criminal complaints and other court papers , the woman said she had recovered suppressed memories of mock weddings , sexual acts involving children , rape and a sex act involving an animal that took place in and around the secluded old bates city farmhouse , a wooded 55acre property formerly owned by her grandfather , burrell e mohler sr the sprawling case has roiled this rural community , on the rolling bluffs above the missouri river and it is especially controversial because it involved what are said to be the yearsold repressed memories of one woman family and friends of the mohlers are questioning the reliability and validity of such memories , which legal experts also debate the authorities , though , say they have physical evidence to back up at least some of the claims five siblings of the 26yearold woman , four girls and a boy , have also come forward with similar accounts of abuse , law enforcement officials say mr mohler , who has been characterized by prosecutors as presiding over the abuse , has been charged with forcible rape and the use of a child in a sexual performance his sons burrell e mohler jr , 53 , jared l mohler , 48 , roland n mohler , 47 , and david a mohler , 52 were also charged with various felonies , including rape on tuesday , a sixth family member , darrel mohler , 72 , a brother of the elder mr mohler , was charged with rape , and prosecutors filed new charges of child sexual abuse against burrel mohler sr and his previously accused sons none of the mohlers has entered a plea on tuesday , the men told a judge that they were still organizing their defense when asked if he had a lawyer , burrell mohler sr told judge john e frerking of lafayette county circuit court , my family s been working on that possibility shackled at the wrists and ankles , the four mohler siblings , their father and his brother searched the courtroom for friendly faces , and in return got some waves and thumbsup from at least a dozen supporters among the spectators the charges seem to be so absurd , they 're unbelievable , said robert bruch , a friend and former employer of the elder mr mohler everybody s in total shock mr bruch said he worshiped with mr mohler at the community of christ church in bates city there was never a question about his loyalty to the church or christ , mr bruch said never one complaint about his behavior a spokesman for the missouri state highway patrol , sgt collin stosberg , pressed on the question of recovered memories leading to criminal charges , said , we feel like we have enough evidence , otherwise we would n't have gotten to this point bob ramsey , a retired chemistry professor who lives next to david mohler in lamoni , iowa , said that he had been close to the mohler family for 20 years and that he had worked with david mohler and his wife at graceland university mr ramsey , 71 , said he had never had concerns about suspicious behavior or abuse in the mohler family my reaction was absolute unbelief , he said it just does not fit the character of david he has been a super helpful , kind individual late tuesday , the associated press reported that a search warrant filed in the case said three of the children told the authorities that they had observed several murders and had been forced to help kill and bury a man in april 1988 an investigator said in a court document that at the old farmhouse he found a broken glass jar , glass fragments , other jars and a bone , although it remains unclear what type of bone was recovered law enforcement officials had been looking specifically for glass jars with written statements inside the complainants , they said , told them that as children , they had written what happened to them on pieces of paper and buried them in glass jars in the backyard , hoping that once buried , the memories would go away when asked if investigators had found any written statements , sergeant stosberg declined to comment

last week , protesters in several cities disrupted townhall meetings on health care that were held by members of congress while democrats claim that the protests were organized by conservative lobbying groups , republicans say that the response was an unprovoked negative reaction to the obama administration s proposals the white house , which was caught a bit off guard by the reaction , has started a web site to respond to some of the protesters claims liberal groups , meanwhile , have expressed their disappointment that the administration did not support a governmentrun plan like canada s or a singlepayer system why has that idea seemed to lose support so fast \? is its failure to catch on a good development or a bad one \? is the director of health policy at the center for american progress and served on the white house health care reform task force in 1993 with republicans demanding that the public health insurance option be taken off the table for bipartisan health reform talks to move forward , why should reform advocates continue pushing for a public plan \? because offering the choice of a public plan helps us achieve the goals of health reform covering everyone and controlling costs a congressional budget office analysis of an early proposal concluded that premiums for the public option would average 10 percent lower than premiums for typical private coverage the cbo also estimated that onethird of americans who qualify for help with their health insurance premiums would enroll in this costeffective choice economists argue that the public option s lower premiums would force private insurers to lower their rates , too public and private plans have different competitive advantages lower administrative costs versus tighter controls on the provider network , for example but the healthy competition of each plan bringing their best game to the insurance marketplace should drive down costs for all the individuals and businesses who purchase coverage , and the taxpayers who help subsidize premiums for some of these customers read more the public health insurance option also provides the best platform for health system innovation the improvements that will drive longterm changes in health care costs today s public plans , notably medicare and the veteran s health administration , have historically been national leaders in payment reform , health information technology and other innovations the public health insurance option can play the same role could we achieve health reform without a public health insurance option \? in theory , we could reform the health insurance market , provide new help with health insurance premiums and tackle rising health care costs without a public plan but we are already struggling over how much to invest in reform and how to pay for it this will be even harder if we abandon the public option is president of the , a nonprofit research organization focused on freemarket ideas in the health sector the white house is recognizing reality as its health reform agenda faces serious trouble and is backing away from its insistence on a public plan the public plan option has been a lightning rod for opposition to health reform because many people believe it is a track to a singlepayer , governmentrun system legislation has passed four out of five key committees in congress that would establish this new governmentrun health insurance program as well as impose mandates on employers and individuals to get and pay for health coverage , drastically expand medicaid and impose strict new federal regulation of the health insurance market people turning out in town hall meetings around the country are not astroturf groups , as house speaker nancy pelosi asserts , but largely american citizens who are genuinely concerned about the president s proposals for sweeping reforms that will have an impact on onesixth of our economy what the president miscalculated in putting health reform at the top of his change agenda is that the thing people cherish most about health care is security change scares them , as politicians across the land are suddenly seeing read more the president surely will sign anything that congress sends him and he wants to sign a bill this year people want to be heard now they are fearful of this change agenda the white house must remove the public plan option as the centerpiece of its reform in order to calm the growing anxiety and begin to have a more reasoned debate over meaningful health reform it may be too late is a professor of medicine at harvard medical school , a primarycare doctor and cofounder of  the health insurers have already won reads the cover story in business week s aug 6 issue that s the short answer to why the public option option is off the table as well as to why the new bill will use an individual mandate to force the uninsured to buy private insurance or , more fundamentally , why congress didn t pursue the singlepayer , medicareforall approach used in other developed nations the public option was never single payer certainly , the option would have cut into private insurers profits \( that s why they killed it \) but their profits about 10 billion are a fraction of what they waste on marketing \( to attract the healthy \) demarketing \( to avoid the sick \) billing their evershifting roster of enrollees fighting with providers over bills and lobbying politicians doctors and hospitals spend billions more on paperwork , none of which the public option would save in contrast , single payer would eliminate private insurance , saving nearly 400 billion annually on insurance and provider paperwork , enough to cover the uninsured and plug the gaps in coverage for those with insurance in 2007 , 62 percent of us bankruptcies occurred in the wake of medical illness , and 77 percent of those in medical bankruptcy had health insurance \( usually private insurance \) when they first got sick read more private health insurance is a defective consumer product , and congress has no business forcing uninsured americans to buy it in order to get the bill out of committee , speaker nancy pelosi promised singlepayer supporters , led by representative anthony weiner of new york a floor vote in the fall this is a tremendous victory for singlepayer supporters like my group , the 16 , 000member physicians for a national health program members of congress , many of whom say they personally support single payer , must now go on record on the eve of the 2010 electoral cycle constituents take note ! is a senior fellow at she was the administrator of health care financing administration \( now the center for medicare and medicaid services \) from 1990 to 1992 and the chairwoman of the medicare payment advisory commission from 1997 to 2001 for many democrats , a public plan option administered by the government and offered as one of the choices in a health insurance exchange is critical to health care reform it is seen as a way of increasing pressure on insurance companies the only way to keep private insurance honest is the phrase used and of offering more choices to consumers for most republicans and some democrats , a public plan is expected to use the power of government to play by different rules and set belowmarket rates of reimbursement like medicare undermining private insurance to ultimately become the dominant form of insurance the need for and attraction of the public plan depends on which problems are being addressed if it s making sure plans can t discriminate according to health status , that s a goal regulation can accomplish guaranteed issue and renewability and rate bands are already used in massachusetts and some other states in fact , the insurance companies have already offered to support these concepts in exchange for having everyone covered if the objective is to ensure there are choices available , the cooperative idea that senator kent conrad , a democrat from north dakota , and others have mentioned on a state or regional basis is one strategy for areas that have no nonprofit plans currently available of course , it may be that like part d medicare , new coverage will bring forward an unexpected number of new plans read more if , however , the real attraction of a pubic plan is make use of undermarket rate reimbursement to produce savings for the public plan , then the concern raised is a real one like medicare already is shown to do , this will push costs to the private plans and ultimately make them uncompetitive of course , for some , that is the attraction of a public plan , professor and chairman of the department of community and family medicine at howard university college of medicine , is the chief attending physician for the howard university hospital free clinic health reform without a public insurance option will not bring us what is needed to provide adequate health care to the nation and slow escalating medical costs a public insurance option would spur competition among insurance companies and provide a muchneeded blanket of coverage for citizens currently , we have a health care safety net but our net has too many large holes unfortunately , our citizens are slipping through those holes and not getting the health care they need as a result , uninsured patients are using the hospital emergency rooms for their primary care our current public health insurance plans provide coverage only for seniors , the disabled , certain children and some of the nation s poor but while some are helped through medicaid , many are not , because eligibility is determined by states with differing standards consequently , a person covered in california might go without coverage in texas and it is nearly impossible for a single male to get coverage under medicaid a public health option in the proposed health reform plan would change that read more most important , the public insurance option provides competition , the ingredient that historically has spurred growth , innovation and kept prices within reach of the average american not having the option just allows the private sector to mandate care for many americans and stimulate unrestrained expenditures when one considers that some regions , in some cases entire states , are dependent upon only one health insurance company , the need for the competition a public option would bring is apparent we have competition now between the united states post service , fedex and the united parcel service and while most would applaud the innovations and changes to the market and to the us postal service that fedex and ups have brought , no one is proposing shutting down the nation s postal service then why are we so fearful of a governmentsponsored option for health insurance \? is a principal scientist at she has worked at the health care financing administration \( now the center for medicare and medicaid services \) on health care , among other issues , under both republican and democratic administrations consideration of a publicsponsored health insurance plan may be waning because of fear of a government takeover of health care , despite the modest realities of what has actually been proposed this development is not good for lasting health care reform because it removes a potential costreducing mechanism from the policy debate the biggest challenge for reform is reducing health care costs unless reform includes ways to lower care prices , the costs of health insurance and the amount and effectiveness of care americans receive , we won t achieve meaningful change a public health insurance option is one potential way to lower health insurance costs governmentsponsored health insurance options , like the federal medicare program , have a number of structural differences that make them inherently less expensive than private insurance public programs like medicare operate efficiently , with much lower administrative and operational costs public programs devote far fewer health care dollars to marketing and enrollment , and don t take profits medicare administrative costs are less than half those of typical private insurers , saving 5 percent or more of total health care spending these differences suggest that health insurance competition with a public plan would create strong incentives for private plans to lower their costs in order to compete lower costs that could be passed on to employers , individuals and other organizations that purchase insurance read more when private plans operate in the current market place , many of them compete having similar internal administrative , profit , marketing and other cost drivers introduction of a lower cost public plan will give the health insurance market another different competitor against which to benchmark costs the alternative to competition with a public plan could be government price regulation , but this would involve even greater , more powerful government intervention competition among health insurance plans has existed for decades , and that s a good thing that should continue on new terms
practically , you might say , the state of colorado has two junior senators , separated by just a few weeks the resignation yesterday of ken salazar , who became the new interior secretary , paved the way for today s swearingin of michael bennet , the denver schools chief appointed to the post by gov bill ritter mr salazar and colorado s other new senator , mark udall , who was elected in november and sworn in earlier this month , escorted mr bennet down the aisle for the official ceremony , presided at by none other than vice president joseph r biden jr , \( a longtime former senator himself \) the newest member also holds another distinction he s the youngest member at age 44 the democrat is joining the senate at a time when a changing of the guard is quite conspicuous , having lost the institutional knowledge of such elders as john warner , ted stevens or pete domenici all of whom are gone \( not to mention mr biden , who had been in the senate since he turned 30 \) senator mark pryor had been the youngest he turned 46 on jan 10 while the average age of the senate body remains about 63 , several new members are younger alaska senator mark begich is 46 jeff merkley of oregon is 52 and several other newcomers are in their 50 s or early 60 s in welcoming mr bennet , senate majority leader harry reid noted that mr bennet s leadership will be invaluable as we expand educational opportunities for all americans , address the needs of the american west and face many great challenges throughout the nation with several of the newcomers hailing from the west , mr reid s brief mention of the region isn t without merit population shifts and renewed emphasis on the environment bode well for enhancing the credentials and influence of congressional members from that part of the country mr bennet s seat comes open in 2010 , and he has indicated that he intends to run for election to it this class of freshman senators has been growing nearly every week so far we d bet that roland burris , sworn in just last week after corruptionrelated scandals surrounding the illinois governor waylaid the seating of president obama s replacement , greeted mr bennet with an inner smile in one week , he outgrew his status \( or lack thereof \) as the newest or greenest member of the senate and depending on how things go in new york they have been a little bumpy this week in the empire state mr bennet may be able to shed his newbie label once gov david paterson gets around to naming a replacement for hillary rodham clinton that would leave only minnesota without a senator , until the situation between democrat al franken and former incumbent norm coleman is resolved right now , the democratic majority stands at 57 , with two independents
