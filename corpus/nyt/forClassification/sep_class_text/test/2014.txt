the 2014 season ended in with an explosion of joy not only from lewis hamilton , his family and his mercedes team as the briton and his second drivers' title much of britain also celebrated , with the story making headlines at the major media outlets , helped by prince harry referring to hamilton as a living legend over the car radio on the last lap but it was not just hamilton s supporters and camp who celebrated most formula one fans welcomed a fitting end to an exciting season that perhaps should have been a bore , so dominant was hamilton s mercedes team from beginning to end but it was thanks to the tight battle between hamilton and his teammate , nico rosberg , that the season was a tense affair to the end not since 1988 has a single team so dominated a formula one season while offering a gripping fight for the title between its drivers that year , mclaren won all but one of the 16 races , as its drivers , ayrton senna and alain prost , two of the sport s greatest rivals , waged a fierce battle for the champion s crown in 2014 , there were 19 races , and mercedes beat mclaren s record of 15 victories in a season , as hamilton and rosberg won 16 races they also set a record of finishing first and second 11 times this year s competition , like that of 1988 , pitted two almost evenly matched drivers against each other in a tight and sometimes vicious battle for the title they both knew that the only true rival they had was their teammate , and the pressure sometimes pushed them to the edge of fair play it s been so intense between us all year long , there s been good moments and bad moments , hamilton said after winning but i think with our relationship , we 'll continue to try to lift the team up , we 'll work together as we have done all year long perhaps things naturally will ease up a little now the tension in the final race was accentuated by the decision this year to award double points in the season finale , a move that was made in hopes of extending the title battle to the end of the season although hamilton had twice as many victories as rosberg 11 to 5 and led the german by 17 points , the new policy meant that rosberg s chances of winning the title were double what they would be in the traditional points system so there was general relief that the man with the most victories won the title in the end i was delighted to see lewis hamilton win the world championship , stirling moss , often considered the best driver never to have won a title , wrote in the daily mail without a doubt he has been the fastest man in the fastest car and he deserved his victory from the start of the season , however , the biggest story apart from the battle of the mercedes teammates was that of the new engine regulations what first dominated the news was the fact that the new 16liter engines were so technologically advanced that they had done away with one of the defining , excitementgenerating factors of the series noise but the new engines went on to have far greater repercussions , generating virtually every other controversy and racing highlight of the season it was obvious from the outset that mercedes had beaten both ferrari and renault to the challenge of creating the best engine under the new rules for a downsized , hybrid engine the failure of ferrari and renault meant that renault not only let down its clients this year but also lost clients for next year and it generated a bloodbath of personnel changes at the ferrari team like none seen in decades the team first fired the head of its engine project , luca marmorini it then dropped its sporting director , stefano domenicali , replacing him in april with marco mattiacci , a director from the ferrari road car division in the united states who had no previous experience with the racing team it followed that with the firing of the chairman of ferrari , luca cordero di montezemolo , who last decade had been the architect of the team s greatest era finally , on monday , the team announced that it was replacing mattiacci after only seven months on the job ferrari s engine failure also led to the departure of the spanish driver fernando alonso after he had spent five years chasing his third drivers' title without success ferrari then announced that it would hire sebastian vettel away from the red bull team , where he had won four straight drivers' titles beginning in 2010 but vettel s decision to leave red bull was also prompted by the failure of the renault engine and the success of the mercedes engine , which brought to an end the vettelred bull domination , giving fans a change of air the mercedes engine also was involved in the reemergence of williams , a team that had been strong but that had fallen into a long period of languishing farther and farther away from the front of the grid it was a fitting end to the season , said rob smedley , the team s head of performance engineering , after the two williams drivers , felipe massa and valtteri bottas , finished second and third in abu dhabi , ensuring that the team finished third over all in the series the team has come on over the year in an incredible fashion to get our best result of the season in the final race is a fitting tribute to all the work we have done , he added it s been over 10 years since williams was last p3 in the constructors' and that is testament to the effort that the guys have made , many of whom have been here through the tough times and are now reaping the benefit of their commitment so while the new engine formula had been widely criticized within the series , its effects were farreaching and even entertaining moreover , the new engine and chassis regulations actually helped create tighter racing up and down the pack , except against the two mercedes cars it was at one of the teams at the back of the pack that the series brought a tragic reminder of the high stakes on a wet track at the japanese grand prix at suzuka in october , the marussia driver jules bianchi spun out of control and into a crane vehicle that was clearing away a car from a previous crash in the same spot bianchi suffered serious head injuries and has not yet returned to consciousness , nearly two months later but at the seasonending abu dhabi grand prix , there were words of encouragement and support from several teams and drivers for the frenchman , with the forzajules twitter hashtag visible throughout the weekend on signs and elsewhere
this spring , the students union at the university college london banned meetings of a group called the nietzsche club , which was formed to discuss the ideas of philosophers who inspired , among others , farright politicians and leaders of the past , like benito mussolini , an admirer of nietzsche s work the union council decided that the discussion of such thinkers and ideas would foster a dangerous wave of fascism among its students , and prevented them from holding a public meeting to those of us in philosophy concerned with ideological censorship , this incident seems like the tip of the iceberg in an impending struggle over the prospects of a serious scholarly engagement with some of the most important philosophers of the 19th and 20 th centuries but , unlike the actual arctic ice sheets that are melting at an alarming rate , the freeze imposed on thinking is showing no signs of abating in particular , there is a menacing chill forming around the work of martin heidegger with the publication of volumes 946 in heidegger s complete works containing the infamous black notebooks \( or private diaries , not yet translated into english \) earlier this year , his critics , pointing at the incontrovertible evidence of heidegger s antisemitism , now claim that his philosophy is suffused with objectionable ideas through and through so much so that the critique of modernity developed by the german thinker is being reinterpreted as a way to launder his antisemitism  as a jew , who suffered from antisemitic discrimination in the final years of the soviet union , i am weary of the contemporary manifestations of this hateful ideology but i also find irksome the attempts to use the label antisemitism as a tool for silencing dissent both opposition to zionism and the thinking inspired by heidegger now incur this charge , which is leveled too lightly , thoughtlessly , and therefore without a minimum of respect for the actual victims of ethnic or religious oppression of course , none of the recent revelations about heidegger should be suppressed or dismissed but neither should they turn into mantras and formulas , meant to discredit one of the most original philosophical frameworks of the past century at issue are not only concepts \( such as beingintheworld \) or methodologies \( such as hermeneutical ontology \) but the ever fresh way of thinking that holds in store countless possibilities that are not sanctioned by the prevalent technoscientific rationality , which governs much of philosophy within the walls of the academia it is , in fact , these possibilities that are the true targets of heidegger s detractors , who are determined to smear the entirety of his thought and work with the double charge of nazism and antisemitism now , if canonical philosophers were blacklisted based on their prejudices and political engagements , then there wouldn t be all that many left in the western tradition plato and aristotle would be out as defenders of slavery and chauvinism st augustine would be expelled for his intolerance toward heretics and heathens hegel would be banned for his unconditional admiration for napoleon bonaparte , in whom he saw world spirit on horseback as for heidegger himself , those minimally versed in his thought will know whether they admit it or not that his antisemitism contradicts both the spirit and the letter of his texts , regardless of the ontological or metaphysical mantle he bestows upon antisemitic discourse perhaps the german thinker did not sense this contradiction , but this does not mean that it was not there let me give you an example in one deplorable turn of phrase in black notebooks , heidegger writes about the worldlessness of judaism and associates the jews uprooting from a national territory with the worldhistorical task of uprooting all beings from being , which , according to heidegger , judaism presumably shares with modernity as well as with bolshevism , americanism , british imperialism , and so on the french philosopher emmanuel faye is correct to trace this concept of worldlessness that describes the state of an inanimate object , such as a stone , back to heidegger s 1929 course on the fundamental concepts of metaphysics as worldless , the jews are reduced to the level of things a classical dehumanization technique but from this valid argument , faye jumps to a ridiculous conclusion that the heideggerian notion of beingintheworld , which is central to being and time , may take on the meaning of a discriminatory term with antisemitic intent while his first point probes the depths of heidegger s antisemitism , the second is an amateurish trick , endeavoring to taint a fecund idea by means of nothing but free association well before the publication of black notebooks , heidegger s organicist metaphors for spiritual life that is rooted , plantlike , in the native soil \( for instance in discourse on thinking \) could be read as denying genuine talent and creativity to those who did not enjoy a strong connection to the home ground , including , in the first instance , the jewish people but such racist nearsightedness does not at all follow from the content of his philosophy in fact , one could say that the jewish mode of rootedness was temporal , rather than spatial before the zionist project undertook to change this state of affairs , the jews were grounded only in the tradition , instead of a national territory such grounding is anathema to the uprooted condition of modernity , with which heidegger hurriedly identified jewish life and thought and which is expressed , precisely , in the destruction of tradition from the perspective of the author of being and time , the temporal nature of jewish rootedness should have been viewed as more desirable than spatial ties to the soil after all , didn t heidegger want to make \( finite \) time , rather than space , fundamental to human existence \? there is , then , a profound disconnect between heidegger s antisemitic prejudice and his philosophy , which influenced a number of prominent jewish thinkers , from hannah arendt to jacques derrida , and from leo strauss to emmanuel levinas yet , more and more , one is forced to justify the very act of reading his works for purposes other than denunciation and censure as my colleague marcia cavalcante schuback \( who translated being and time into portuguese \) and i write in our forthcoming commentary on heidegger s 19345 seminar analyzing hegel s political philosophy the case of heidegger , or l affaire heidegger , as the french call it , is the case of philosophy facing the loss of its right and what are all the controversies surrounding heidegger s nazism about if not the right of and to his thought , not to mention the right to think further on his path , despite , against , or with his past \? more broadly formulated , the question is about who has the right to pursue philosophy , to call herself or himself a philosopher , and to deny this appellation to others in his book , heidegger the introduction of nazism into philosophy , when referring to heidegger , faye often renders the word philosopher in quotation marks the current fight for the possibility of reading certain philosophical works is , therefore , a fight over the very meaning of philosophy , with or without quotation marks is a philosophy professor at the university of the basque country \( upvehu \) , vitoriagasteiz his most recent book is phenomena critique logos the project of critical phenomenology

the arrived at madison square garden on wednesday for their second game \( in two countries \) in a 27hour span they were hoping to avoid the pitfalls of the dreaded backtoback , one of the more exhausting realities of the nba schedule no practice little rest and facing an opponent that was benefiting from plenty of both so the appeared to have everything going for them , and then they went about wasting every advantage they had in a 9795 loss to the magic before j r smith s lastgasp 3pointer sailed long , the knicks \( 27 \) were undone by poor perimeter defense and foul trouble their losing streak reached six games , a psychological drag on their halting pursuit of competence the postmortems are already beginning to sound familiar talked about the loss being a tough one to swallow coach derek fisher again referred to bad habits and smith was left to explain his curious choices i think it was the right shot , smith said of his 27footer , a haphazard attempt that banked off the bottom of the backboard i just did n't make it anthony , who had called for the ball without success , looked disgusted as the buzzer sounded he finished with 27 points while shooting 10 of 17 i mean , he had an open shot or he thought he had an open shot , anthony said of smith i do n't think i'm going to get it every time evan fournier scored 28 points for the magic \( 36 \) , who shot 471 percent and went to the freethrow line 32 times we 're a team that s working to create a new identity in the face of what used to be , fisher said and right now , our guys are n't trusting that they know how to win and close these games out and we have to find a way to break through that fear of failing before the game , fisher said he was grateful for the opportunity to practice tuesday the knicks had played five games in seven days , losing every one of them , so an afternoon to regroup qualified as a luxury practice allows you to prepare for games , fisher said if his point was obvious , it was still worth making there was work to be done that work will continue with his team trailing by 10 against the magic , fisher called a timeout 54 seconds into the third quarter the knicks managed to respond anthony scored 7 points in a 90 run as the knicks regained the lead before he retreated to the bench with four fouls anthony picked up his fifth midway through the fourth quarter despite his struggles on defense , anthony did what he could to compensate at the other end after he whittled the lead to 2 with a 3pointer and a free throw , orlando s channing frye sank a turnaround jumper in the lane for a 9490 lead anthony later drilled a 3pointer to cut the lead to 9695 with 43 seconds left after fournier sank 1 of 2 free throws , the knicks had time to set up a final play pablo prigioni inbounded the ball to smith , who threw one up from deep game over fisher said the play had multiple options , although none of them involved smith launching a leaning 3pointer once the ball came to j r , he trusted himself , fisher said i have no problem with a guy believing in himself fisher has continuously shuffled his lineups , and he was at it again at the start of wednesday s game , sliding anthony to small forward to make room for quincy acy at power forward acy has been hampered by a sore wrist , but fisher said he was hoping that acy could put defensive pressure on frye fournier turned out to be the bigger issue he was 5 of 6 from the field in the first quarter , scoring 15 points the magic ran out to a 5650 lead by halftime the early season has been a process , difficult at times , for the knicks when phil jackson , the team president , spoke with members of the news media monday , he said the team would probably have a good feel for which players were picking up on the system by late november or december he seemed to be implying some sort of informal deadline it is no secret that the knicks will undergo enormous change next summer , with jackson preserving space under the salary cap to bolster the roster while allowing several expensive contracts to expire on wednesday , fisher was asked about investing so much time and energy in players who may not be here for long to assume anything is not very smart at all , fisher said guys that you assume will be here for a long time may not guys that you think wo n't be here could be here forever so it s really only my job to focus on the here and now even if , after another loss , the here and now is not a particularly pleasant place to be
masahiro tanaka introduced himself to the on wednesday with a captivating fourhit shutout in ron darling , a former mets pitcher and an sny broadcaster , had seen something like it before last month , when the hosted the chicago cubs for a chilly matinee , darling ventured to the bronx and saw tanaka darling , who was not on the mets' trip , could not resist the lure of seeing tanaka in person he was a joy to watch , darling said i had to watch him i mean , my job is to watch him , but i'm also a fan to darling , tanaka stood out for the way he carried himself regally , darling said , as if he knew he belonged and for his mechanics tom seaver may be the godfather of the dropanddrive delivery , but tanaka is a descendant seaver was listed at 6 feet 1 inch and 195 pounds , roughly the same as tanaka , who is 62 and 205 pounds his size makes him more of a dropanddrive guy , darling said we see guys 6foot5 , 240 , all the time throwing 100 miles an hour he s not small , but he s smallish for a righthander , but he s able to max it out so he uses his legs he uses his ability to push from the rubber once he starts his windup , he looks more like someone from my generation of pitchers than from today s generation making his first appearance in queens , where seaver spent most of his hall of fame career , tanaka on wednesday throttled a mets lineup that had punished his teammates for 21 runs the previous two nights tanaka walked none , struck out eight and never let a runner past second base in an interview last month , seaver said he was not familiar with tanaka but seaver , who dropped so low in his delivery that his back knee often scraped the dirt as he drove off the rubber , had a simple explanation for his style what are the biggest muscles in your body \? seaver said legs and butt makes sense to me do you want your shoulder to do all the work \? pitching in an era in which the number of pitching injuries is increasing more often to the elbow than to the shoulder tanaka theoretically takes pressure off his arm by using his legs the yankees have already lost three of their five projected starters to injury , and they need tanaka to stay sturdy david cone , a former mets and yankees righthander who calls games for the yes network , said tanaka generated an exceptionally long stride by driving with his legs when i look at a pitcher , i always look at his leg kick , cone said if you have a guy that has a leg kick that s just pick it up and put it down' and has a shorter stride , that s a control artist , a guy that s sacrificing velocity for control the front leg tells you a lot tanaka s got a little extension that helps him reach out and extend his stride , and he does push off the back leg pretty well you see him in the middle of his delivery , and from contact with the rubber with the back leg to where he ends up landing , it s pretty wide espn sport science measured tanaka s stride as 610 roughly 110 percent of his height , compared with an average of 85 percent this allows tanaka to release his pitches closer to the plate , getting them there more quickly and with a later break seaver , who was also known for a long stride , held up long enough to pitch 4 , 783 regularseason innings , ranking 19th on the career list he pitched his final season for the mets in 1983 and was briefly teammates with darling , who remembers a coach in the organization , the former boston pitcher bill monbouquette , shouting , drop and drive ! as young pitchers warmed up that s all you 'd hear , all the time , darling said , adding , i think dropanddrive is synonymous with using your legs because if you do , you wo n't suffer the arm injuries so many people suffer darling said many modern pitchers simply might not have legs strong enough to use them as effectively as tanaka does he does not drop nearly as low as seaver did , but watching tanaka borrow even a little from seaver , while perhaps protecting his arm better than most of his peers , should be comforting to the yankees he was everything they needed on wednesday and looked most impressive in the seventh inning facing the mets' 345 hitters for the third time in the game , tanaka struck out the side , using a different weapon to finish each hitter david wright went down swinging on a slider , curtis granderson took a thirdstrike curveball , and chris young whiffed on 93mileperhour heat wright said tanaka kept the mets off balance with exceptional command of his fastball , curveball , slider and splitter the mets' futility , wright said , had nothing to do with their unfamiliarity tanaka , with a style that would fit in any era , showed timeless dominance the way he threw the ball tonight , wright said , no matter how many times we 'd seen him , the result probably would have been the same
hortense fiquet c zanne is one of the great mystery women in art she sat for 29 paintings by her husband and smiles in none of them more often than not , she is portrayed indoors , a matronly woman with her hair primly parted in the middle and her dress buttoned up almost to her chin yet there is something appealing about her plainness she is nothing like her contemporaries in impressionist pictures , who pass their days at boating parties and picnics , their long dresses billowing in the breeze , sunlight warming their skin madame c zanne , by contrast , looks as if she does not get out of the house much and could use a break the good news is that hortense fiquet is about to have her moment in the sun madame c zanne , which opened this week at the metropolitan museum of art , is the first exhibition devoted to paul c zanne s portraits of his wife it is a remarkably comprehensive show that brings together drawings , watercolors and 24 paintings nearly every existing painting of her , not counting the two that belong to the nonlending barnes foundation and remain on permanent view in philadelphia organized by dita amory , the met show revisits those mythic years in late19thcentury france when c zanne was working in relative obscurity , developing a style of painting that would later be hailed as the source of all things modern his wife was his most frequent model and awaits rescue from decades of dismissive and even misogynistic scholarship she has been belittled as sullen , shallow , unfeminine and fat earlier scholars often mentioned that c zanne himself joked that hortense , as everyone called her , liked nothing except switzerland and lemonade , a comment that can be used to mean anything john rewald , the c zanne expert , claimed that hortense had no influence on her husband whatsoever based on hearsay and the entrenched chauvinism of his era , rewald described her as a clotheshorse who cared little for art in his biography of the artist , he repeats the baseless rumor that hortense , who was living in paris , failed to materialize at her husband s deathbed in aixenprovence because she had a pressing appointment with her dressmaker the negativity that surrounds her life story extends to the paintings as well it has often been said that c zanne s portraits of hortense are less sexy than the apples in his still lifes , less animated than the expressively blurred pinetree branches in his views of mont saintevictoire on the other hand , to learn about hortense c zanne is to come up quickly against the limits of biography the gaps and omissions in her life story are more striking than the facts she left no diaries or date books , and only two of her letters are known to survive c zanne s art was itself a defiant exercise in antibiography when he painted a portrait , he was n't trying to produce a realistic likeness or capture a personality rather , the central drama of his work lies in the attention he paid to form in arthistory textbooks , he is invariably pegged as a protocubist who laid the groundwork for abstract painting and sought to treat nature in terms of the cylinder , the sphere and the cone , as he put it , a comment i found completely baffling in my student days it left me with an image of an artistgeologist wandering the south of france with an xray machine , trying to uncover euclidean shapes in every tree and hillside what was so radical about that \? you can no more find cylinders in c zanne s paintings than you can find unicycles he invented a new kind of pictorial structure that seemed to give every mark equal weight and integrity he liked to paint the same motifs from slightly different angles , to explore the rotating point of view , to borrow a phrase from jasper johns , another master of restrained emotion who , as it turns out , is lending two graphite drawings by c zanne to the exhibition at the met c zanne s portraits of hortense span a period of 20 years , and she looks different from one painting to the next although she is always seated , she can variously evoke a melancholy madonna , a severe school principal or an androgynous boy with no chest the met show reunites the four dramatic paintings known colloquially as madame c zanne in a red dress in each of them , she sits in the same bluish room , wearing a country dress with long sleeves and a tie belt they culminate in the version owned by the met , in which she leans stiffly to the right , composed and imperturbable as an earthquakelike force sets her chair and the walls around her at a slant in general , c zanne favored female models who were solid and stocky , as if their physical heft enabled him to concentrate on form rather than flesh this is especially true in his drawings he liked to sketch his wife s head as a weighty geometric orb topped by a little bun of hair i paint a head like a door , c zanne once said , without irony his friends bestowed a callous nickname on his wife la boule , which is french for the ball who was mariehortense fiquet , her name at birth \? she met c zanne in paris early in 1869 she was a 19yearold bookbinder and artist s model from a workingclass family he was 11 years older and lived on a meager allowance from his bankerfather by most accounts , he was gruff , withdrawn and suspicious he harbored an aversion to being touched his artwork seemed overly intense as well at the time they met , he had been painting for a decade not the airy landscapes of his later years , with their brushy patches of green and ocher , nor the chunky , skyblue bathers rather , his early work is dark and psychologically disturbing it abounds with fantasy scenes of rape , murder and bacchanalian orgies c zanne kept his relationship with hortense hidden from his family he claimed that his father , who wanted him to be a lawyer and pushed him through law school , would cut off his income if he knew the charade continued for years , even after hortense gave birth to paul jr in 1872 c zanne would remove himself for months at a stretch to his parents' house in his native aixenprovence hortense and the boy would be left in paris , or would come to stay in aix too , but discreetly , in a different house he finally married her after they had been together for 17 years today , it is easy to see hortense in sympathetic terms the useless , donothing wife derided by john rewald sounds more like a beleaguered single mother trying to scrape by in the big city she spent countless hours posing for her husband , who worked slowly and was said to let as much as 20 minutes lapse between the application of one brush stroke and the next the notion of hortense as a clotheshorse defies logic when you recall that she is dressed modestly in the portraits and married a man who had no taste for material trappings c zanne was 56 years old when ambroise vollard gave him his first oneman show it seems likely that hortense was independent and selfpossessed , that she provided c zanne with enough space for him to develop his work , which became classical and monumental in his later years granted , husband and wife lived apart , in different cities , long before death finalized the arrangement c zanne died in 1906 , at 67 , a few days after catching pneumonia he was buried near his parents in aixenprovence he had , unkindly , written hortense out of his will , although their son stepped up to provide for her until her death in 1922 she had always preferred the city to the country , and was buried in paris , at the p re lachaise cemetery paul jr lies beside her at the metropolitan show , some viewers will no doubt discern marital tenderness in the portraits of hortense others will counter that c zanne was manipulative and pressed his wife into service as a model simply for the sake of convenience in truth , she is a rorschach test and , in the absence of documentation not a single letter survives between c zanne and his wife any conclusion you draw about the emotional tenor of their marriage is likely to reflect more on you than on them in the end , all of the labels model , mistress , muse , wife fit poorly , and it is hard to envisage madame c zanne springing from her wan , flattened existence in her husband s paintings into breathing life she remains , despite our best efforts to see her in the round , a homely middleaged woman trapped in a web of brush strokes still , common sense rules in her favor you suspect she believed in c zanne s greatness , and now it is our turn to believe in hers
washington today is the start of the trial in starr international co inc v united states , the case alleging that the government s 2008 bailout of aig amounted to an unconstitutional plunder of the company s shareholders starr , a firm run by the former aig chief executive maurice r greenberg , was the insurer s largest single shareholder at the time it saw the government grab almost 80 percent of its common stock amid the bailout \( a proportion that eventually rose to 92 percent \) , and is asking for a cool 40 billion to make it whole as a legal matter , most experts believe the case is farfetched that the government has no obligation to live up to some abstract notion of fairness when it seizes assets to prevent a global crisis morally , the claim is even weaker aig s stock would have been worthless absent a bailout it is now worth about 80 billion or , as the government s lawyers have put it , the shareholders' stake after washington took most of the company was worth more than their 100 percent equity stake before the rescue arguing that the shareholders deserved even more is like a formerly starving man s insisting he deserved filet mignon rather than a ribeye and yet , as asinine as the starr suit may be in legal terms , it may end up serving a constructive purpose among starr s key claims is that a chunk of the roughly 180 billion the government eventually poured into aig was unnecessary , at least if the point was to save the insurance giant in practice , tens of billions went out the door to other financial institutions , like goldman sachs and deutsche bank , whose risky mortgage securities aig had foolishly insured in the runup to the crisis starr contends that the government could have spent less money on aig and therefore imposed less onerous terms on the company had the bailout s architects directed some of their tough love at the goldmans and deutsche banks of the world and starr is hardly alone in making these claims ever since the details of the aig rescue entered the popular consciousness , everyone from members of congress to financial commentators to occupy wall street protesters and tea party activists have fulminated against the backdoor bailout of goldman et al by fully litigating the issue , the starr trial may finally help heal this festering wound at the heart of the controversy is the fact that the government has never provided a plausible explanation for why the federal reserve bank of new york , which had enormous leverage over banks like goldman thanks to its role as their regulator , did n't lean on them to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar in their payouts from aig former treasury secretary timothy f geithner , who orchestrated the bailout from his previous perch as new york fed president , insists that extracting these haircuts would have shattered the market s confidence and undermined the aig bailout but this explanation is both counterintuitive the haircuts would have helped save aig and stabilize the financial system and ahistoric the fed has long used its leverage over banks in similar situations , to great effect during the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s , an episode mr geithner observed up close as a senior treasury official , the new york fed president , william j mcdonough , leaned on korea s creditors to roll over and lengthen their loans and prevent that country s financial collapse which leaves only two possible explanations for the overly solicitous treatment of goldman and the others the first is that their own financial position was so precarious that accepting anything less than the billions they expected from aig would have destabilized them , too which is to say , it really was a backdoor bailout of the banks many of which , like goldman , claimed they did n't need one alternatively , maybe mr geithner simply felt that goldman and the like had a more legitimate claim to billions of dollars in funds than the taxpayers who were footing the bill either way , forcing an honest admission out of mr geithner , who is scheduled to testify in the trial , would be a helpful , even cathartic , development traumatic historical episodes often require a highprofile public reckoning before the country can move on during the great depression , that reckoning came in the form of the pecora investigation , in which a congressional panel summoned the titans of wall street to answer for their shady dealings in the runup to the crash the aftermath of our recent crisis has brought a variety of attempts to recreate that level of drama from the congressional oversight panel hearings chaired by elizabeth warren to the congressionally chartered financial crisis inquiry commission but none fully exposed the weakness of mr geithner s logic about the aig payouts , at least not in a prominent public forum the starr trial could change that starr s lead lawyer , david boies , is arguably the best litigator of his generation and the dizzyingly high stakes 40 billion is real money , even for the government ensure that the press attention will be smothering legally , starr is unlikely to prevail even if mr boies comes away with a win at the trial court , which has been a favorable venue for wall street , appeals courts are unlikely to accept a decision that effectively requires sweetheart deals for any bailout recipient politically , however , the case could be a coup it s hard to begrudge mr geithner and the fed for doing what they believed was necessary to save the economy but what they should n't be allowed to do is insult our intelligence in the process the starr case , its chutzpah notwithstanding , may be our last hope for ending the charade
a warrant for the arrest of adrian peterson , one of the national football league s top stars , was issued friday after he was charged in a child abuse investigation in texas , the latest criminal case to rock the country s most popular sport the charges against peterson , a running back for the minnesota vikings regarded as one of the best in history , came after the police investigated claims

nfl spokesman did not respond to a message seeking comment depending on the outcome of his case , peterson could be penalized by goodell , who has wide discretion to discipline players who violate the league s personal conduct policy two weeks ago , goodell , in response to criticism that he was too lenient in the rice case , strengthened penalties for players involved in domestic violence under

during the past school year , several leading american universities , including yale , princeton , dartmouth and carnegiemellon , welcomed new presidents these men were leading scholars , and they were experienced administrators in some cases , they held degrees from the universities they now lead and none of them not one inherited the job from his father or mother that goes without saying , right \? nonprofit , taxexempt universities are not typically family dynasties people would think it queer if daughter succeeded her mother as president of harvard but at evangelical christian colleges , including some of the most prominent , there are different expectations since 2007 , the world s largest christian university , liberty university , in lynchburg , va , has been led by jerry falwell jr , the son of the famous founder the presidency of oral roberts university , in tulsa , okla , passed from father to son \( although it has since passed out of the family \) until friday , when stephen jones stepped down as president of bob jones university , in greenville , sc , the college had been led only by bob jones and three generations of his direct descendants in some cases , the transition has worked out well since taking over his father s university in 2007 , mr falwell has overseen stable budgets and explosive enrollment between campus and online students , liberty now enrolls over 100 , 000 men and women but other descendants' tenures have ended badly in 2007 , richard roberts , son of oral , was forced out after accusations that he had misused school funds dr jones , at bob jones university , left after a year in which he was of not being serious about investigating charges of sexual abuse some orthodox jews have rabbinical dynasties , too , and mainline protestantism has its royal families henry sloane coffin , for example , was a leader of the presbyterian church , and his nephew william sloane coffin was the legendary chaplain of yale in the 1960s but in evangelicalism , in particular , where it is common for any solo preacher to found a church , some of the churches are likely to be treated as family businesses , with indigenous cultures that only a few can understand there s obviously a distrust of outsiders , so you want people who know the system , the ministry , what you are about , said , who teaches history at washington state university and is the author of american apocalypse a history of modern evangelicalism the assumption is that people within family know that best and can protect the heritage many of the men who have founded evangelical colleges , like the elder jerry falwell , did so as offshoots of the churches they founded and often they founded those churches because they believed their specific message was not being conveyed by any existing church or large denomination it would thus be a small band of insiders , versed in the particulars of the founder s message , who would even be eligible to carry it into the future that may be why , for example , the presidential search committee at bob jones university , while not seeking another jones descendant , has stated a preference for a bju graduate elesha coffman , a church historian at the university of dubuque theological seminary , in iowa , said prestige could accrue differently in the evangelical world your ministerial credentials in both evangelicalism and pentecostalism have more to do with your biography , your personal story , dr coffman said whereas in the mainline , your credentials are the framed things you hang on the wall so having worked alongside a famous preacher , having been raised by him , is especially valuable on an evangelical s r sum but d michael lindsay , the president of gordon college , an evangelical school near boston , and the author of view from the top , published this week , said this dynastic trend was clustered mainly in newer colleges you 're citing about five examples , out of 500 or so christian colleges in the country , dr lindsay said and you can see it s not happening in more established institutions liberty was started in 1971 that s very different than wheaton billy graham s alma mater , near chicago , founded in 1860 it s the same dynamic you see in family companies william wilson , the second president of oral roberts university not to come from the roberts family , noted that once upon a time , even our most prestigious colleges were startups that hired from within the family at princeton , the theologian and great awakening evangelist took his soninlaw s place as president when he died , dr wilson said at yale , there were two timothy dwights who were president , father and son mr falwell , the current liberty president , said that in fact he was not really inheriting his father s job although the elder falwell had held the title of president , he was focused mainly on his television show and on being a public figure everyone assumed he was running the university , mr falwell said but he was doing other things related to the church in later days , he did have a role in student recruitment by contrast , mr falwell became general counsel of the university in the early 1990s and helped resolve wellpublicized financial problems my job for 15 years was restructuring debt by the time his father , he said , he was far more involved in administration than his father ever was and it is not just in higher education that sons take over for their fathers , or mothers churches and mission groups are inherited by children , too the has been handed off to mr graham s older son , franklin when the pentecostal preacher died in 1944 , her son , rolf , took over the foursquare gospel church , as well as its college , a baptist minister in nashville and a liberty university trustee , agreed that dynastic succession ought to have its limits in the third or fourth generation , it would be more unusual that jerry jr s son would succeed him , he said but for the time being , dr mims said , the board s choice has worked out beautifully i think there s no question that he s the best possible person it remains to be seen whether , when dr mims retires as senior pastor of his church , his own son , jeff , who works under him as a pastor , will take over
abu dhabi , united arab emirates not long after sunrise one recent morning , a camel race here began , as they all do , with two starts first , there was the expected opening about a dozen camels pressed their noses against a dangling metal barrier , and when a man in a sparkling white robe gave the signal , the gate lifted and the herd surged forward , necks bobbing and humps hopping as spindly legs galloped off into the fog a beat later came the second wave as the camels sprinted toward their first turn at alwathba racetrack , a fleet of sport utility vehicles , five or six wide , shifted into gear and zoomed after them , tailing the animals on the paved roads that flanked both sides of the soft dirt track to the uninitiated , it looked like a presidential motorcade locked in a lowspeed chase with a pack of bedouins to the more familiar , it was simply camel racing , modernized inside one of the vehicles , hamad mohammed watched the action from the passenger seat mohammed , who works for an emirati sheikh and trains numerous camels , was tracking his entry , miyan , while a friend navigated through the glut of semidistracted drivers circling the 37mile track miyan broke from the starting line and quickly pulled away from the typical jumbling she settled on an inside position and churned along , flanks heaving beneath green silks the car was quiet , save for the thundering tones of the radio announcer calling the race from a van about 15 feet away , also following the camels as the race neared its midpoint , mohammed picked up a walkietalkie , leaned his face against the window and began to make a clucking sound it was not a word not in arabic or any other language but more of a murmur , a throaty noise like one might use to coax a hesitant dog mohammed made the sound over and over , and miyan , who was at least 20 yards away , responded , surging forward a bit good , mohammed said softly to his friend the robot is working sports are important in this region , both in the uae where bigmoney sponsorships and highend events happen in everything from cricket and soccer to rugby and golf and in other countries , like qatar , which will host the 2019 track and field world championships and the 2022 world cup yet while much of the action here is geared toward outsiders , there is at least one aspect of sporting life that remains primarily a locals' game camel racing , in one form or another , has been part of arabian culture for generations , with some historians tracing races to the seventh century camels are viewed as magnificent creatures here there are even camel beauty pageants and racing is seen as a unifying activity , a sport that brings together people of all backgrounds , whether royals or paupers , businessmen or laborers racing in the uae became more organized in the 1980s and '90s , when zayed bin sultan alnahyan , the first president of the federation , oversaw construction of several racetracks as races became more competitive and prize money grew , many camel owners began to use lightweight children as jockeys , some as young as 2 or 3 , importing them from countries like bangladesh , afghanistan , pakistan and sudan falls and critical injuries were common trading , bartering and kidnapping of child jockeys , as well as accusations of physical and sexual abuse , were frighteningly frequent , too at one point , it was estimated that 40 , 000 child jockeys were being used across the persian gulf the horrors of that human trafficking left a scar for the sport that lingers even now , 12 years after the practice was officially banned in the uae some owners said quietly that they still might prefer to have human jockeys though none would say so publicly but a majority , perhaps recognizing the troubling perception of having children ride animals that stand 6 feet tall and can run up to 40 miles per hour , unabashedly praised the technology now widely used instead robots early models of the robots , which were first produced in 2003 , were cumbersome and weighed as much as 30 pounds the camels generally did not respond well to them , and owners were put off by the difficulty of obtaining them in the years since , the production of the robots has become more local and more streamlined now , camel owners can go to numerous shops or markets in the uae to buy robots and accessories , which can even include deluxe silks \( the robots are made to actually look like tiny jockeys \) the latest version of the robot weighs only a few pounds one shop , located a quick ride \( or , alternately , a leisurely stroll on a camel \) from the racetrack in dubai , advertised its wares with a display of robots in various colors outside the front door inside , two pakistani men , who gave their names as raheem and jameel , worked at tables strewn with tools , bolts and power drills the dewalt power drill is the heart and lungs of the modern robot jockey shop workers like raheem and jameel order the drills in bulk and use them , and their rechargeable batteries , to construct the core of each robot remoteentry clickers \( the kind used for cars \) combine with long ribbons of plastic wrapped in cotton to make a spinning whip that can be activated from afar , and walkietalkies allow the owner to speak to the camel from a trailing suv tailored silks and a spongy head of sorts complete the robot , which can cost less than 2 , 000 dirhams , or around 500 , for a generic model the robots sit on molded metal saddles when they race raheem estimated that he and jameel could make 10 to 20 robots a day , though not all of their customers ask for a full device the shop also handles repairs , and salim ali , a camel owner in dubai , said that the robots could last for several years if taken in for regular checkups nader al jabri , an owner from oman , said that he often shopped for robot parts in the uae because of the high quality of production there he entered the shop in dubai on a recent afternoon and began negotiating the price of a whip with raheem , who was asking for about 10 after a friendly backandforth , al jabri departed with the whip and a smile raheem and jameel went back to work there are always more to make , raheem said the waiting area behind the starting line of a camel racetrack is a gathering of characters walking every which way , some dressed in robes , some dressed in slacks , some leading camels , some talking to or , really , for robots there are owners , trainers , training riders and handlers very rarely are there fans or tourists when mohammed and his friend tracked miyan that morning , they did so in front of an empty grandstand at alwathba this is not uncommon , since betting on camel racing in the uae is not allowed so unless a particularly big race is being contested one seasonending race has a firstplace prize of 1 million dirhams , or about 272 , 000 the interested parties , including sheikhs , generally prefer to watch the events on television a lack of attendance , though , does not equate to a lack of passion owning a camel is an honor in many gulf countries , and there are laws about how much tax a camel owner must pay \( it depends , in part , on how many camels he or she owns \) camels can also be used to pay a woman s dowry prices vary or as collateral in a trade of goods or services buying camels at an auction the suv carrying mohammed had pamphlets from old auctions littered on the floor requires heavy research \( much as buying a thoroughbred does \) , and sale prices for camels can range from as little as 2 , 700 to about 815 , 000 feeding , training and housing a camel costs around 275 per month , according to saeed fayed al zarie , a trainer in dubai who oversees about 40 camels that are mostly kept in a camel community \( a collection of lowceilinged barns \) near the track every day , zarie wakes up at 4 am and feeds the camels , who rouse and begin their walk to training by about 6 am the camels train until around 9 am , then walk back to the barns , eat again and nap until the midafternoon then it s another training session , then more food , and they are back asleep not long after 5 pm , their bellies full with the nine pounds of food , much of it barley , that they eat each day on a race day , the camels line up in the area behind the starting line and wait for their race , kneeling in the sand while their trainers saddle them with the robot jockey and doublecheck the whip and walkietalkie the length of the race depends on the age of the camels , but unlike the action at a horse track , the racing is nearly continuous there are no lulls , no breaks between races as soon as one group crosses the finish line , another gathers at the start then the gate is lifted and the next race begins during the race , the soundtrack is a mix of car horns owners beep at their camels for reasons they struggle to articulate and loud thwacks , which are the sounds made by the robot whips smacking against the camels' hindquarters watching miyan , mohammed waited until the race was about twothirds through before he began to use the whip , alternating between throaty murmurs via the walkietalkie and remotely enabled pops to the rear miyan began to fade as the camels made the final turn , mohammed pressed the whip button a few times and made desperate squawks into the receiver , but there was no kick , no burst he and his friend sighed miyan lumbered on , a bit of foam frothing her lips as she bounced to the finish i am disappointed , mohammed said this is very average miyan came in seventh , good for about 2 , 500 after she crossed the finish line , handlers removed her robot and saddle selected camels and their equipment are tested after races to ensure no drugs or artificial substances were used and led her back through a gate if she had finished in one of the top three places , her head and neck would have been rubbed with golden saffron , a sacred spice , as a show of honor on this day , she simply went to the waiting area to cool down mohammed and his friend idled in the suv , discussing miyan s race and groaning about her performance after a few moments , the friend hit the gas and mohammed sat back in his seat there was another race beginning , another opportunity the gate lifted the camels bolted from the start line the engines thundered and the suvs lurched forward , their horns beeping and their tires squealing as they chased the robots through a thin layer of earlymorning fog
beverly hills , calif power in hollywood is still signaled by who sits where at a handful of watering holes , but restaurant real estate as status symbol is fleeting lose that studio chairmanship on monday , say hello to siberia on tuesday that is one reason movie and television executives , for nearly four decades , have placed so much value on the caricatures covering the walls of the local palm steakhouse lose at the box office , lose the big client , lose the moviestar good looks you never lost your spot at the palm status cemented until now the palm restaurant here has started over , its 39yearold west hollywood location and opening a 4 million new restaurant here last friday and the walls are almost bare , glaringly portraitfree slates that have caused a ripple of anxiety in moviedom over revoked statuses and set up a subtle new immortalization competition the handwringing over the caricatures has taken years off my life , said bruce b bozzi jr , the executive vice president of the , which has 26 locations do we move the old ones \? that was n't possible there were 2 , 300 of them do we pick 100 to move \? the most powerful \? no , i would be a dead man so he decided to start over , even though he knew some traditionalists would be unhappy only one image , to his knowledge , had ever been removed from the west hollywood location oj simpson \( the restaurant covered him up after somebody following his 1995 murder trial stuck a steak knife in his portrait forehead \) some hollywood heavyweights insist they are thrilled to be obliterated i'm personally relieved to have that picture of me go away , said ron meyer , the vice chairman of nbcuniversal , who first made the palm s wall as a cofounder of creative artists agency in the mid1970s i had an afro and glasses that were too big barry diller , the chairman of iac interactivecorp and onetime head of paramount and fox , called the decision to start over very clever , helping to refocus entertainment industry attention on the palm , which had to newer outposts like soho house besides , mr diller said , the palm had awarded so many caricatures over the years that the prestige factor had worn off it got a little stale , he said but at least one former entertainment mogul struck a bitter tone it s not a lot of fun to be thrown out in the trash , the semiretired executive said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw attention to his status \( or lack thereof \) imagine if sardi s announced one day that it was going to remove its cartoons people would be heartsick mr bozzi , 48 , said he understood the hard feelings aside from serving as a time capsule , the palm s famed drawings slice to the heart of one of hollywood s core personality defects vanity the hitdriven nature of the entertainment industry also leads to deep insecurity , making public validation all the more valuable the same is true of the palm in washington , which has been around since 1972 and where there are caricature hierarchies some regulars joke that you are not really anyone at that location unless you appear twice , signaling staying power over multiple presidencies people get very worked up over these silly pictures , mr bozzi said caricatures have been what mr bozzi calls a rivet of the palm restaurants since shortly after his greatgrandfather pio bozzi cofounded the company in 1926 the first location , opened on second avenue in midtown manhattan , became a news media hangout when newspaper cartoonists were short on cash , particularly during the depression , they were at times allowed to exchange artwork for a meal mr bozzi noted that none of the old west hollywood caricatures were thrown in the trash instead , each picture was sawed off the wall and offered as a gift to the person who inspired it mr meyer s office picked his up steven spielberg and brad grey , paramount s current chairman , were among the others to request the images , mr bozzi said in the end , he did move a few of the old caricatures to the new restaurant warren beatty and jack nicholson , for instance , occupy a spot next to the front door farrah fawcett and lee majors , painted as a pair , also made the cut i wanted to pay homage to the '70s , when we first put down roots , mr bozzi said so far , mr bozzi has authorized five new power portraits amy pascal , a cochairwoman of sony pictures entertainment , a talent agent who died in 2011 sherry lansing , the former chief executive of paramount steven tyler of aerosmith and the bravo television personality andy cohen why them \? because they 're fabulous , mr bozzi said , flashing a smile \( and at least a couple are \) mr bozzi , whose companion is bryan lourd , the creative artists agency , says he sees the new location as an opportunity to reclaim the power lunch crowd by moving into the heart of beverly hills the palm was pushed out of its old location by a condominium and retail complex the restaurant is now in walking distance of entertainment companies like metrogoldwynmayer and william morris endeavor still , william morris and creative artists are vehement rivals will wme hold my ties to caa against me \?

sochi , russia after finishing her 1 , 500meter race sunday , heather richardson stepped off the speedskating oval and buried her face in her hands she did not have to say a thing the leader board said it all the united states speedskating team s nightmare of an olympics was nearly halfway done , but its woes were far from over dutch skaters were dominating so much that the likes of it had not been seen since the east german team and its doping machine crushed the competition in the 1980s and the americans , even though several were favorites entering the sochi games , could do little to compete , including sunday , when  i went home and cried forever after the 1 , 000 , richardson said of the 1 , 000meter race last week , in which she finished seventh she was seventh in the 1 , 500 , too but you eventually have to let it go it is hard to let it go , though , when the united states speedskating team has come up empty time and again here and that is partly the fault of the coaches , who introduced distractions when the team needed to remain focused american speedskaters longtrack and shorttrack ones were projected to win 10 medals here , but through eight events , with eight left , they have none the biggest disappointment has been shani davis , who finished eighth  what makes all this particularly shocking is that speedskating has been the most successful winter games sport for the united states american speedskaters have won 85 olympic medals , about a third of the medals won by the united states over all in the winter games at the 2010 olympics , the united states took home 10 medals , four in longtrack and six in shorttrack the sport has produced some of america s most decorated olympians eric heiden , bonnie blair and apolo ohno , to name a few but no stars have emerged from these games , and no one can explain why but they can guess some blame the new skin suits the americans wore specifically for these games they were called the world s fastest skin suits , the mach 39 , and the united states coaches decided the athletes would wait until the olympics to compete in them , so other teams would not have an opportunity to copy the technology the suits , made by under armour , were manufactured in conjunction with the aerospace giant lockheed martin they were tested in wind tunnels , finetuned and supposedly perfected and the athletes evidently loved the suits , until they started to perform poorly late last week , to the under armour suits it had worn during the world cup season , but the performances did not improve ryan shimabukuro , one of the united states coaches , did not blame the suits instead , he explained how well the team prepares for competition it is built on consistency , he said , and does n't change anything we make sure we do n't change anything on competition day , he said if that s true , then it made little sense to have the athletes wait until the last minute to compete in new gear those new uniforms gave them an excuse when they did not skate well , and that could have affected their confidence for the rest of the competition mike plant , the executive vice president for business operations for the atlanta braves , who took over as the president of us speedskating last year , said sunday that the timing of the switch had not been not ideal it s a lesson learned now , that we should get the athletes more comfortable with new things before we use them in competition , he said plant also dismissed the suggestion that training at a high altitude before coming to sochi had caused problems one skater s coach criticized the highaltitude training because the ice was harder and faster than the ice in sochi , which is at sea level plant said he had a better excuse maybe the dutch are just better speedskating is second only to soccer in popularity in the netherlands , and the talent pool from which the country chooses its olympians is deep in sochi , the dutch have won 16 speedskating medals in long track , breaking the record of 13 set by the east germans in 1988 other teams have been suffering because of that success south korea won 13 speedskating medals in 2010 , including five golds , but has won only one medal in sochi so far japan and germany , like the americans , have none in trying to explain how surprised the americans have been in their struggles , plant compared the team to the denver broncos , who were dealt a humiliating 438 defeat by the seattle seahawks in this year s super bowl right now , it s like we 're john fox of the broncos the morning after the super bowl , saying , wow , what the heck happened \? ' plant said we were one of the best teams going in now we have to do a deep dive into this , and look at data , talk to experts , to figure out what went wrong perhaps an answer will materialize , but it is never a good sign to be bickering about excuses in the middle of the games and it is never a good sign to be compared to the broncos , though at least that team eked out 8 points the united states speedskaters have been shut out so far at least one american athlete , jilleanne rookard , who was 18th in the 1 , 500 on sunday , was not optimistic that the team could get back on track right away it might be heartbreaking for the athletes who have trained so hard for so many years , but she was just being realistic probably not this olympics , she said you know , my little niece is 8 , so hopefully in eight years , we 'll have it figured out by then
in 17thcentury china , newly rich merchants and bureaucrats bought albums of poetry and woodblock prints to give themselves an intellectual air the library , art collections , and botanical gardens in san marino , calif , has acquired a set of texts and images from the 1630s that owners showed often to their friends but preserved nearly intact the works' publisher , hu zhengyan , used various artists' designs to carve wood blocks with feathery and stippled details that imitate brushwork he ran a workshop in nanjing called ten bamboo , so the collection is titled the ten bamboo studio collection of calligraphy and pictures the huntington bought it from the gallery in manhattan for an unspecified price in the six figures it is believed to be the most complete ten bamboo set to survive , said mary ann rogers , an owner of kaikodo two of the original 326 pages are missing crude copies of hu s work abound if all you 'd seen were later prints , it would be hard to imagine what the first edition looked like , said t june li , a huntington curator who helped finance the acquisition hu s artist team depicted birds , rocks , fruit , bamboo , orchids and hands holding paintbrushes the historian suzanne e wright , who has ten bamboo , said that the workshop also offered stationery to clients seeking to join the literary class hu collected ancient bronzes and jades and studied their inscriptions , and he carved seals for customers including members of the ming court a politician friend in his circle described his work as treasured beyond wealth ten editions of his prints and poetry were eventually published in china and japan , sometimes with eroded wood blocks that had been gouged by worms none are worth looking at , a japanese publisher insisted in the 1880s the edition sets were broken up again and again over the centuries individual pages typically bring a few hundred dollars at  the huntington s album was exported to japan around 1760 , and it eventually belonged to a series of japanese artists who were influenced by hu s naturalism at some point the bindings were dismantled , and the ten bamboo gossamer papers were mounted on heavier backings american collectors who thought the prints were japanese acquired them after  the huntington will be scanning the set for posting online and is also planning to exhibit works by hu and his competitors letters written on their stationery have been turning up , dr wright said , and she has also found playing cards from the era s publishers that helped educate owners about historical figures and popular fiction plots there s a whole set that focuses on famous drunkards , she said the only property owned by the british novelist d h lawrence , which he called kiowa ranch , near taos , nm , reopened to the public in early july after years of being a shuttered health hazard traces of hantavirus had been found in mouse droppings at the 160acre site the property s owner , the university of new mexico , had stopped letting the public visit the scattered cabins and a 1930s memorial chapel a dozen 1940s guest huts , originally used by los alamos scientists and infested by mice , remain off limits they were a blight , stan riveles , president of the , said lawrence spent summers on the ranch in the 1920s , and his germanborn wife , a baroness whose maiden name was emma maria frieda johanna von richthofen , stayed on for three decades after his death in 1930 , at 44 frieda lawrence had his cremated remains transferred there from a medieval cemetery in southern france , and she is believed to have incorporated the ashes into the chapel s concrete sunflowers are painted on the chapel walls , and she is buried just outside the front door the cabins have weathered furniture but no one is quite sure which pieces date to lawrence s era , when he helped build and repair the ranch buildings as tuberculosis ruined his health there s an old wooden chair that he may have made , william haller , president of the , said researchers are looking for artifacts that were long at the site but are now missing , he said , including a typewriter , a suitcase and clothing believed to have belonged to the author , his wife and their companion dorothy brett , a british painter longtime caretakers left behind boxes of unsorted papers there s documentary material there that needs to be archived , mr riveles said we do n't know what s there the taos area has numerous preserved homes and collections that belonged to members of the lawrence circle , which included the oil heiress millicent , the writer dodge luhan \( d h lawrence painted geometric patterns on her bathroom windows \) and the artists fechin , eanger irving , joseph h sharp and l blumenschein the on the town plaza displays nine 1920s erotic paintings by lawrence scholars have been comparing numerous memoirs of life at kiowa ranch luhan and brett wrote versions of the story that portray frieda lawrence as a moody villainess in frieda lawrence s telling , however , she did n't want to make herself look unhappy , because she thought it was humiliating not to keep up appearances , said katherine toy miller , a writer in taos in 2016 , the museum of art in taos will present an exhibition about luhan and her celebrated friends , including gertrude stein , georgia o'keeffe , ansel adams , marsden hartley and willa cather a handful of objects that luhan owned during her friendship with the lawrences have been found , including a steamer trunk , persian and mughal paintings of hunting scenes and navajo turquoise jewelry much of the contents of luhan s house , however , belonged to a subsequent owner of the property , the actor dennis hopper , who kept it in storage lois palken rudnick , a curator of the luhan show , said , we do n't have a clue as to what happened to that furniture
london in the drizzle outside craven cottage , the stadium that is home to fulham , one of england s oldest professional teams , the knots of fans who gathered during training sessions thursday night for a shot at the autographs of their heroes had two men atop their lists one was james rodr guez , real madrid s colombian midfielder , who was the top scorer at last summer s world cup in brazil the other was a quiet , unassuming 50yearold whose glory days as a player crested when many of the younger fans clustering at the stadium gate were barely out of their cradles his name is jurgen klinsmann , and what brought him to craven cottage , along with rodr guez , was the friendly match set for friday between colombia and the united states men s national team , coached by klinsmann for klinsmann , is something of a homecoming he is celebrated here , as few other foreign players have been , , where he played with success during a nomadic career that also took him to stuttgart , germany milan monaco munich and genoa , italy in his three years as the united states coach , klinsmann has sometimes been less popular among his team s fans than among those who cheered him at spurs he stirred controversy recently with remarks that some american soccer officials interpreted as disparaging of his own players and especially of the quality of play in major league soccer , at least compared with the top european leagues meeting reporters on thursday , klinsmann avoided reigniting that debate and instead noted the ties that made fulham a natural choice for an american team competing in england other top english clubs have fielded american players the united states team s best player at last summer s world cup , tim howard , is the longtime starting goalkeeper at everton , and defender geoff cameron is a regular at stoke city but none have had as many american players on their rosters as fulham that list includes the former national team players carlos bocanegra , brian mcbride , kasey keller and clint dempsey the current fulham squad includes emerson hyndman , a promising young american the club was even nicknamed fulamerica at one point it is a very special place for us , klinsmann said in soccer , friendly internationals can , at their worst , pack all the punch of a damp firecracker but the london contest has the potential to defy the norm a day before kickoff , the game was heading for a sellout , with 23 , 000 tickets sold , a record for an international at fulham while many londonbased americans are expected , most of the tickets appear to have gone to colombians based in london and elsewhere in northern europe , to the point that klinsmann and others in the american camp have said that they are approaching the match as a colombia home game klinsmann has billed the london game and another friendly , against ireland in dublin on tuesday , as important steppingstones on the path to the next world cup on thursday , he described friday s match as a very , very good benchmark against a team that is the top five in the world he said the game provided an opportunity to introduce a group of younger players and to have team veterans mentor them klinsmann named some of his world cup veterans to his traveling roster , but the list is far more interesting to american fans for the prospects on it among them are jordan morris , 20 , who plays for stanford and rubio rubin , 18 , who is under contract with the dutch club utrecht another american drawing notice , especially in this city , is deandre yedlin , 21 , a defender for the seattle sounders in mls yedlin was a standout for the american team in brazil , and he has since signed to join klinsmann s old club , yedlin told reporters that klinsmann had been an important influence in his decision to move to europe but speaking with a caution that suggested a reluctance to reignite the sensitivities that klinsmann s remarks had stirred , yedlin also called mls one of the top four or five leagues in the world still , he said , soccer is the biggest sport over here , it s a little bit more competitive yedlin added , if we want to get to the top , we need to have more of our players in the top leagues yedlin was signed for his play over the summer , but some of his teammates are no doubt hoping to take his place our message to the players is always to push themselves to reach their highest potential possible , klinsmann there is certainly value in being in the type of football environment where there is pressure every day from teammates , fans and the media for you to perform obviously there is a lot of quality in the biggest competitions in europe , and that can only help you get better the key no matter where you are is that you have earned playing time
athens stood in a packed hall on a recent afternoon and pumped his fist toward a cheering crowd financial markets have been forcing to dance to their tune , mr tsipras , the firebrand leader of s leftist syriza party , shouted during a rally on the island of crete now , we will lead the dance , and the markets will follow ! it was the kind of talk that has built mr tsipras a powerful following in this austerityweary country it has also spooked international investors as greece faces the possibility of an unexpectedly early general election that could bring mr tsipras and his party to power next year , opening the door to a sharp change in the nation s relationship with europe and even a rethinking of its commitment to continued membership at all costs in the european currency but while greece is being closely watched by the rest of the european union and global financial markets , the machinations here have not yet produced the sense of crisis felt across the continent in 2012 , when it last seemed possible that the country could drop out of the euro in brussels , in national capitals and on trading floors , there is a general sense that europe could survive a breakup with greece , if it came to that , with relatively minimal damage , thanks to an array of recent regulatory changes and a renewed commitment among the leaders of the largest countries to keeping the european union moving forward even in the face of setbacks the situation is shaping up as the first big test of europe s progress in building safeguards against the financial contagion that rocked the continent five years ago and insulating the core political union against the antieuropean populist backlash from both left and right that has taken root in nearly every country if greece were to step out , this would not lead to an immediate contagion threatening the other countries because financially we have strengthened the system , said paul de grauwe , a professor of european political economy at the london school of economics but other risks political risks are still there the first step in the maneuvering toward a possible general election took place wednesday evening , when parliament took the first of three votes scheduled over the next several weeks to select a new president , a largely ceremonial post if the current centerright government , led by prime minister antonis samaras , cannot elect its presidential candidate by the end of the third vote , on dec 29 , it is likely to call a quick general election , which polls at the moment suggest mr tsipras s party would win the government got 160 votes on wednesday for its candidate , 40 short of the 200 necessary to prevail in this round and 20 short of the 180 necessary in the third and final round though greece and other european economies are still reeling from the effects of the longrunning , new firewalls designed to insulate the eurozone from widespread turmoil appear to be working a pledge by the european central bank to do whatever it takes to prevent a resurgence of the crisis has kept markets calm two new institutions that aim to provide financial assistance to weak countries have created added insurance regulators have centralized their oversight of european banks to make sure none are taking the types of risky bets that helped ignite europe s and other nations that were forced to take billions in taxpayer bailouts during the crisis , including ireland and spain , have recovered and are less likely to be tainted by any new financial tremors that greece might produce the architecture of the euro is much more solid , and an escalation of the crisis similar to what we saw in 2012 from any potential escalation in greece is unlikely today , said martin lueck , an economist at the swiss bank ubs in frankfurt the biggest remaining vulnerability to any shock induced by greece may be political with unemployment still high in most countries , national governments still cutting back on social welfare programs and divisive issues like immigration fueling intense debates , populist and nationalistic appeals from both left and right have resonated across the continent , many of them with a distinct antieuropean message should mr tsipras take power in greece , it would give more prominence and credibility to other antieuropean parties mr tsipras and others on the far right and left in countries including italy , france and spain represent a backlash against everything the euro stands for , professor de grauwe said today the political elites who are currently in power have invested their capital in keeping the eurozone together , he said but now we have other politicians investing in doing exactly the opposite too many countries could at some point say , we do n't want to be part of this , ' and that could still drive the euro apart the longer governments wait to address the underlying causes of economic malaise , said mohamed elerian , the chief economic adviser at allianz , the more complex the economic challenges and the greater the political complications will be each delay reinforces economic obstacles to growth , empowers extreme political parties , and makes it harder for governments to agree on a common interpretation of the past and present , let alone come together to deliver a better future for the eurozone , he said eurozone leaders have also shied away from creating a federalist architecture to more readily transfer financial support to weak countries , which economists say is also critical to bolstering the euro s foundations a look at greece s problems explains why even without such a system , taxpayers in germany , spain , ireland and other nations are partly financing the 240 billion euro bailout being administered by the socalled troika the european commission , the european central bank and the should mr tsipras come to power and compel greece s creditors to forgive billions of euros in debt , taxpayers in those countries will lose money mr tsipras has said he does not want greece to leave the eurozone , and has made it a point to soften the fiery remarks he employed during national elections in 2012 , when he threatened to tear up greece s bailout agreement and default on the debt instead , he wants creditors to accept a writedown of the debt , saying that the nation , reeling from a fiveyear recession and a 25 percent unemployment rate , can probably never pay back all it owes but he has threatened to reverse austerity cuts required for greece to continue receiving its bailout money or a new credit line , including raising the minimum wage and reinstating christmas bonuses he has not said how he would pay for those spending increases on the streets of athens , such pledges hold growing appeal andonis koulaxizis , 58 , an accountant whose income has slumped amid a fiveyear recession , said he did not believe mr tsipras could keep any of his promises but he blamed the current government for worsening the economy , and said the prospect of edging mr samaras from power was appealing , despite the wider risks that might come from fresh political chaos now is the opportunity to protest what this government has put us through , said mr koulaxizis , whose clients have lost jobs and earnings , leaving many unable to pay him for his services other greeks feel more frightened after mr samaras pushed forward the timing for the selection of a new president , 15 billion was wiped off the athens stock exchange last week , and foreign investors immediately pulled back from greece everything has stopped working , and the conversation about a possible exit is back again , said a person who helps run one of greece s biggest construction companies , who declined to be named for fear of running afoul of politicians we are just on the verge of getting out of a recession , he said why destroy everything now \?
read    the phrase absence of evidence isn t evidence of absence has been attributed to martin rees , om , astronomer royal , former master of trinity college , and expresident of the royal society 1 it was used by him and then by carl sagan in discussions about the possibility of intelligent life somewhere else in the cosmos \( there are those who believe we have no direct evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence and those who believe we might have direct evidence , eg , the wow ! signal , a strong signal detected by a radio telescope that has never been repeated \) 2 and it involves questions about the nature of evidence , about how to separate in a mass of data the signal from the noise i have met martin rees a number of times , most recently at stephen hawking s 70thbirthday party , and so i called him hoping to get some additional insight into his use of the phrase errol morris the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence every time i ve tried to track down its origins , it leads back to you martin rees i ve used it , but i m sure i wasn t the first to use it errol morris does it appear in any of your books or writings \? martin rees it certainly appears in some of my written lectures the citations are few and far between but it was attributed to martin rees in a symposium on extraterrestrial intelligence , life beyond earth and the mind of man , edited by richard berendzen 3  errol morris even if you didn t originate it , i was hoping you would explain to me what you meant by it martin rees i don t think it s anything profound it s within the context of looking for aliens if we don t see anything , it doesn t mean they re not there they may be very different from us they may not be trying to communicate when i ve used it , it s just been in that specific sense errol morris well , i think what happened is and i could be completely wrong about this that it appeared initially in the context of , is there life elsewhere in the universe \? and it s not just an absence of evidence , because we have all kinds of statistical evidence that would suggest that there is  martin rees no , we don t we don t have any evidence errol morris yes and no we have statistical evidence we have evidence of how many planets that might be like ours \? for example , the drake equation the equation that estimates the likelihood of life elsewhere in the universe 4  martin rees yes but we don t know if life started in these places certainly , at the time of the cyclops project cyclops a design study of a system for detecting extraterrestrial intelligent life , nasa , 1971 , they were looking for signals from intelligent life and even if simple life is common , then intelligent life may be rare and only a tiny subset of intelligent life might be sending out signals errol morris but rumsfeld , when he used it martin rees i didn t know he had used it errol morris he used it again and again he used it in the case of weapons of mass destruction in iraq presumably , the argument is , just because we can t find any evidence that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction , that doesn t mean he doesn t have weapons of mass destruction martin rees i don t regard that as profound it s a fairly obvious comment that is used in all kinds of different contexts errol morris and the known known and the known unknown \? martin rees this is not profound , either , but it s an interesting distinction most people who write about risk and hazard would distinguish between risk and uncertainty errol morris yes , but martin rees risk is something where you can assign a probability but as to what s going to happen in 10 or 20 years , then you can t really assign realistic probabilities i suppose that d be what you d call an unknown unknown ultimately , i don t think there s anything special in the scientific method that goes beyond what a detective does i believe martin rees is correct there is no direct evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe , though we have statistical evidence to suggest that it might be out there we have theories about where to look for it , how we might detect it , how rare it might be , and so on we have charts and equations and tools and algorithms to help direct our focus 5 but is combing the cosmos for signs of intelligent life really just like inspecting iraq for signs of wmd \? martin rees wrote in our cosmic habitat  some brains may package reality in a fashion that we can t conceive others could be uncommunicative living contemplative lives , perhaps deep under some planetary ocean , doing nothing to reveal their presence there may be a lot more life out there than we could ever detect absence of evidence is not evidence of absence 6 absence of direct evidence , may not be proof of absence , but often absence of evidence is evidence of absence if a weapons inspector looks for wmd in a building and finds nothing , is that absence of evidence \? or evidence of absence \? i would argue that it is evidence of absence rumsfeld took a principle used in one context is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and applied it to iraq imagine someone tells you that there is an elephant in the room you search the room , opening drawers , checking closets , looking under the bed no elephant absence of evidence or evidence of absence \? hans blix , the executive chairman of the united nations monitoring , verification , and inspection commission , addressed some of these concerns in his book disarming iraq  several countries , including the us , had given us a good number of sites for possible inspection , and at none of the many sites we actually inspected had we found any prohibited activity the sites we had been given were supposedly the best that the various intelligence agencies could give this shocked me if this was the best , what was the rest \? well , i could not exclude the possibility that there was solid nonsite related intelligence that was not shared with us , and which conclusively showed that iraq still had weapons of mass destruction but could there be 100percent certainty about the existence of weapons of mass destruction but zeropercent knowledge about their location \? 7 blix leaves us with a rhetorical question could there be 100 percent certainty of the existence of wmd in iraq and no knowledge of where they might be \? blix s answer is probably not in a news conference on sept 26 , 2002 , pam hess asked rumsfeld pam hess if an inspection team goes in now and finds nothing , because perhaps iraq is very good at hiding it , or perhaps they have nothing but you all are of the belief that they have it if they find nothing , does it make your job more difficult in trying to assemble an international coalition to disarm him by other means \? donald rumsfeld goodness gracious , that is kind of like looking down the road for every conceivable pothole you can find and then driving into it i don t get up in the morning and ask myself that we know they have weapons of mass destruction we know they have active programs there isn t any debate about it my emphasis ultimately , wmd were not found in iraq , and rumsfeld s belief proved to be false many people assume that rumsfeld was lying that he knew that there were no wmd in iraq but i believe that he was able to convince himself that he was telling the truth or even worse , that he lacked the ability to discriminate between truth and fantasy that over the years he had developed a gobbledygook philosophy that seemingly paying lip service to empiricism devalued evidence and made a mockery of logic alas , if you believe that you are 100 percent right , then your beliefs are like a hard , impenetrable , protective shell , like the carapace of a turtle 8 what do i take from this \? to me , progress hinges on our ability to discriminate knowledge from belief , fact from fantasy , on the basis of evidence it s not the known unknown from the known known , or the unknown unknown from the known unknown , that is crucial to progress it s what evidence do you have for x , y or z \? what is the justification for your beliefs \? when confronted with such a question , rumsfeld was never , ever able to come up with an answer the history of the iraq war is replete with false assumptions , misinterpreted evidence , errors in judgment mistakes can be made we all make them but rumsfeld created a climate where mistakes could be made with little or no way to correct them basic questions about evidence for wmd were replaced with equivocations and obfuscations a hall of mirrors an infinite regress to nowhere what do i know i know \? what do i know i know i know \? what do i know i don t know i don t know \? ad infinitum absence of evidence could be evidence of absence or evidence of presence take your pick an obscurantist s dream there s a quotation i have never liked it comes from f scott fitzgerald s the crackup the test of a firstrate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time , and still retain the ability to function not really the test of a firstrate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and know they are opposed people embrace contradictory positions , often without being aware of it sometimes not caring sometimes proud of it rumsfeld seems \( with pleasure \) to say p and notp what he would call the two sides of the coin one side if you wish for peace , prepare for war the other side , belief in the inevitability of conflict can become one of its main causes not exactly a contradiction but where does he stand \? his followup all generalizations are false , including this one doesn t clarify much of anything 9 when asked how colin powell could have presented such shoddy evidence for wmd in iraq to the united nations , rumsfeld told me , because he believed it fine , as far as it goes my guess is rumsfeld is right when powell appeared before the united nations on feb 5 , 2003 , he believed what he was saying 10 the secretary also showed satellite photographs of what he said were chemical and biological facilities , and drawings based on witnesses descriptions of trucks and rail cars converted into mobile laboratories for lethal materials , allegedly intended to evade detection he said various records and intelligence showed that mr hussein was making nuclear weapons and developing rockets and aircraft to deliver all his weapons 11 rumsfeld , too , may believe what he is saying but believing something does not make it true the question is why he believed what he believed on the basis of what evidence \? mere belief is not enough in lewis carroll s alice in wonderland , alice , perplexed by her encounter with the cheshire cat , says , i have seen a cat without a grin , but i have never seen a grin without a cat i had a similar experience with donald rumsfeld his grin and my puzzlement about what it might mean i was left with the frightening suspicion that the grin might not be hiding anything it was a grin of supreme selfsatisfaction and behind the grin might be nothing at all 1 in a somewhat different form it appears in the writings of william cowper , although i have been hardpressed to find any specific attribution but cowper s version involves proof , not evidence that absence of proof isn t proof of absence just because we haven t been able to prove that god exists doesn t mean that he doesn t samuel joeckel writes in an article for quodlibet journal entitled localizing the problem of evil william cowper and the poetics of perspectivalism throughout his life , cowper suffered from psychological disorders and traumas that racked his tempestuous mind and soul in his provocatively titled study , boswell s clap and other essays medical analyses of literary men s afflictions , medical doctor william b ober diagnoses cowper as a psychotic who suffered from mental depression with suicidal tendencies his madness was colored strongly by religious delusions centering about his own damnation 2 on the night of aug 15 , 1977 , an extraordinary signal was detected by the big ear radio telescope at the ohio state university dr jerry ehman reviewing the recent computer printouts recording what big ear had heard was astonished to see that the telescope had detected a strong , narrowband radio signal that seemed to fit the pattern researchers expected to see if intelligent life attempted to make contact the alphanumeric sequence circled in the wow ! signal indicates the intensity variation of the signal as received at the big ear radio telescope , and functions as a sort of signaltonoise ratio each number or letter indicates the number of standard deviations \( a 10 , b 11 , etc \) by which the received signal exceeded the average background noise these numbers and letters tell us both that the signal received was way louder than the noise of space , and also that it increased and faded in intensity in a manner consistent with a transmission received from an extraterrestrial source that is to say , it came from outer space , it was loud , and it lasted for as long as we could measure alas , it was never detected again 3 berendzen writes a generation ago almost all scientists would have argued , often ex cathedra , that there probably is no life in the universe besides what we know here on earth but as martin rees , the cosmologist , has succinctly put it , absence of evidence is not evidence of absence 4 the drake equation calculates n , the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which radiocommunication might be possible based on r the average rate of star formation in our galaxy f the fraction of those stars that have planets n the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets f the fraction of planets that could support life

beirut , lebanon the syrian government announced on monday that president bashar alassad would compete in a scheduled for june 3 that is widely seen as an attempt to enhance his perceived legitimacy despite a that has pushed his government out of much of the country and displaced millions of citizens although recent legal changes mean that mr assad will run opposed for the first time since he took over from his father , hafez alassad , in 2000 , his victory is considered a foregone conclusion , and most expect it will do nothing to stop the war the syrian election comes amid a series of votes across the arab world that despite purporting to show democracy in action indicate how little the protest movements known collectively as the arab spring have affected the region s traditional power structures egypt has engaged in a wideranging crackdown on dissent before a vote that will almost surely name abdulfattah elsisi , the former defense minister , president algeria on monday witnessed the swearing in of its ailing septuagenarian president , abdelaziz bouteflika lebanese leaders continue to barter over who will become their new , largely symbolic head of state in syria , election preparations have highlighted the yawning gaps between the supporters of mr assad s government , who say he is fighting a necessary war against foreignbacked extremists , and the opposition , which considers him a brutal dictator who must be overthrown after mr assad s candidacy was announced , armed men sped through parts of damascus , firing guns in the air , and hundreds of people , many of them high school students and government employees , staged proassad rallies i love president bashar and my whole family loves him , said rania , a high school student at a rally who declined to give her last name to the foreign news media i do n't care about the other candidates , she said i do n't even know their names the news barely made a ripple in opposition areas what do you think of this criminal and killer who wants to dress up in a new outfit and say , i'm the legitimate president \? ' said tamam hazim , an antigovernment activist reached through skype in aleppo , where he said his home had recently been destroyed by a bomb dropped from a government helicopter speaking of mr assad , he cited an arabic proverb he has destroyed it and is sitting on the ruins the lack of reliable polling inside the country makes it impossible to gauge how much support mr assad has , although many syrians have stuck by him , seeing him as a symbol of the nation or fearing that an opposition victory could lead to islamist rule the syrian national coalition , the group of syrian exiles that purports to lead the uprising , has failed to gather significant support inside the country and has called the vote a farce the syrian government has given no indication of how it will gather votes from the millions of syrians who have sought refuge from the violence in neighboring countries , other than saying syrian expatriates can vote in their embassies nor has it explained how it will organize voting in areas controlled by armed rebel groups instead , the state news media has focused on the strict formality of the process holding an election in such circumstances has less to do with determining the will of the people than with projecting an image of normality and power , said joshua stacher , a political scientist at kent state university who wrote a examining the structure of mr assad s rule it is basically a message to opponents and to potential opponents that you do n't stand a chance , that we are so powerful that we can rig an election in the middle of a civil war , he said the other six people who have announced their intention to run include businessmen , former ministers , members of parliament and one woman none have made any public statements about the policies they would pursue nor implied that they would lead the country better than mr assad undermining the government s portrayal of its complete control , antigovernment activists reported on monday that the nusra front , the qaeda affiliate in syria , had agreed to restore electricity to governmentcontrolled neighborhoods in aleppo in exchange for reduced shelling of opposition neighborhoods rebels who took over the power station that supplies the city shut off the electricity to governmentheld neighborhoods 10 days ago to protest continued government attacks , according to aleppobased activists and the syrian observatory for human rights , which tracks the conflict from britain through contacts inside syria after mediation by prominent aleppo residents , the nusra front and other rebel groups turned the power back on , activists said an online statement attributed to the nusra front warned that if the government did not stop striking opposition neighborhoods , it would cut the power again our response will be harsher than before , the statement said the government did not comment
the online voting platform for the unofficial referendum now underway on hong kong s political future has been subjected to one of the most severe cyberattacks of its kind ever seen , according to the head of the internet security company tasked with protecting it matthew prince , chief executive and cofounder of the san franciscobased company cloudflare , said in an email friday that the distributed denialofservice attack \( also known as ddos \) on occupy central s voting platform was one of the largest and most persistent ever mr prince said the attackers appeared to have commanded a network of compromised computers around the world to overwhelm the platform with traffic in hopes of disabling it the owners of the computers exploited in such attacks are usually unaware that they have been compromised despite minor hiccups in the voting system , apparently caused by the denialofservice attack , by saturday it had recorded more than half a million votes in less than 30 hours , in a city with a population of 72 million voting in the unofficial referendum , which asks permanent residents of hong kong to choose one of three methods for nominating candidates for chief executive , is to continue until june 29 on friday , the first day of voting , beijing denounced the referendum as illegal and invalid hong kong s chief executive , leung chunying , said none of the three proposals complied with hong kong s basic law , the territory s de facto constitution all three plans would allow candidates to get onto the ballot by collecting enough signatures , which would mean the chinese government could not screen candidates through allies on a nominating committee occupy central supporters suspect that the central government is behind the attack opponents have asserted that it is a ploy by the campaign s sympathizers to rally public support mr prince said that about 20 percent of the computers used in the attack were from indonesia , 10 percent from brazil and the rest from elsewhere indonesia and brazil are known to have a large number of compromised computers , he said china , notably , was not among the 10 countries with the most computers involved , mr prince said that s actually surprising , and not just for the political reasons that may be motivating this attack , but more because china typically has a very large number of compromised machines , he said in the email while the computers used in the attack could be traced , it was impossible to tell where the herder , the person directing the attacks , was located , he said next media , which publishes apple daily , a chineselanguage hong kong newspaper supportive of occupy central , was also subjected to a severe cyberattack before the voting began the polling organization commissioned by occupy central to conduct the referendum said friday that it would increase the number of voting booths to be provided on june 29 , the last day of voting it also said that a police investigation into the denialofservice attack had begun the mobile application used for voting has become the most popular iphone app in hong kong and the secondmostpopular for androidbased devices while the initial attacks interrupted much of the online registration process , the actual voting has been smooth many supporters of the campaign , including charles mok , a legislator representing the information technology sector , have praised cloudflare for its work thank you eastdakota and cloudflare for your support for the democratic aspirations of the people of hong kong !  charles mok \( charlesmok \) 20 jun 14 responding to his sudden popularity in hong kong , mr prince said that he might come to the city during the first week of july \( a large prodemocracy march is held in hong kong each year on july 1 , the anniversary of the former british colony s return to chinese sovereignty \) he also said he might open the company s first asian office in hong kong instead of singapore were thinking of opening cloudflare s asian office in singapore after all the love tonight , thinking maybe hong kong instead  matthew prince \( eastdakota \) 20 jun 14
s o paulo , brazil near dusk on a recent sunday afternoon , a crowd of about 50 people mingled around a makeshift stage while warbling , in sloppy karaoke , the lyrics to the brazilian song que se chama amor \( or that is called love \) nearby , a group of women sipped wine from paper cups while watching a group of boys kick a soccer ball back and forth next to them , a pair of families pushed strollers none of this would have been particularly notable , except for the fact that all of it was taking place in the middle of a fourlane highway in the heart of a city known for its concrete skyline and perpetually choked roads , there is , at least once a week , a slice of relief technically , this 22mile stretch of road is named the via elevada presidente costa e silva , but every paulista knows it simply as the minhoc o the english translation of minhoc o is earthworm , though the highway s name also evokes a mythical 80foot long creature that , legend has it , has been slinking its way through south american backwaters for more than a century in this city , the minhoc o is not a creature it is a haven on weekdays , the highway is packed with cars that creep along its elevated path at 10 or 20 miles per hour still an improvement over the crushing gridlock of the surface streets below after 9 pm , however , and , more important , for the entire day on sundays and holidays , the minhoc o is closed to traffic at these times , it becomes that alluring combination of ugliness and beauty the road is not pretty it is cracked and crumbling \( it opened in 1970 \) , and graffiti covers its skin its charm , though , lies in its pieces the median , where families sit crosslegged and have picnics the sides , which are so close to the apartment buildings flanking the road that it feels as if you could turn on an oven from the right lane and the ramps , which welcome joggers and skateboarders and strollers and dogs and cats and children and wheelchairs and , of course , boys juggling soccer balls with wellworn covers almost from the moment it was built , there has been public discussion about tearing down the minhoc o it is , by all objective measures , a blight its presence crushed the housing market in the area after all , living near a highway , let alone within touching distance of one , is not desirable the minhoc o s underbelly , too , has become a focal point for drug users and the homeless yet the people of this neighborhood are hesitant yes , it is loud yes , the smoke and exhaust can be suffocating but on sundays , yes , on sundays , there is peace for us , it is like when we see the movies and there is san francisco , said geraldo souza , 57 , stopping for a moment to lean against a barrier at the side of the road he waved his hand in the movies , there are always the trolleys on the streets in san francisco that is what people know he shrugged here , there is the minhoc o it is not perfect but it is ours
on tuesday evening , jared donaldson entered a mostly empty interview room after a matteroffact , straightsets loss at the to ga l monfils of france at 17 , donaldson is part of a vanguard the united states tennis association hopes will invigorate men s tennis in this country while the business of tennis in the united states is doing fine , the championship imperative seems to have vanished the men have been invisible , and the women are hanging by the thread of s dominance i asked donaldson if he felt men s tennis was dead in the united states and , if so , if he took it to heart i do n't take it personally , he said i use it as motivation he added i think what people who follow tennis , what people in this country want is a person contending for grand slams , someone they can get behind , saying , he has a chance at the australian , a chance at the french , a chance at wimbledon and a chance to win here' we 're trying hard it s tough in many ways , the life \( or death \) of men s tennis in the united states has become irrelevant \( who is from switzerland \) , rafael nadal \( spain \) and novak djokovic \( serbia \) have become role models and beacons for american players in a way that has obliterated the need or hope for an american men s champion legendary american players like john mcenroe , jimmy connors and even pete sampras are relics for me it s hard to relate with those players because i did n't grow up watching them , donaldson said i admire roger federer that s really who i rooted for when i was young i always wanted him to win slams i really admire djokovic s game right now sampras was the dominant force in men s tennis when donaldson was born in 1996 seven years later , andy roddick won the us open he is the last american man to have won the tournament while the intervening years have produced a widening talent gap , fueled by players who come from places other than the united states , there remains a vibrant pipeline of american women , even if the pipeline is defined by serena williams on tuesday , the teenager catherine bellis , the no 12 seed at the end of bellis s match , the small court was overflowing with spectators as news spread about the 15year old girl from california around the same time , 19yearold madison keys , the no 27 seed , was finishing off a 60 , 63 rout of jarmila gajdosova at louis armstrong stadium keys said she felt she was in a surge of talented young players from the united states i definitely think there s a big group of women and men right now that are slowly doing better and better , kind of making a name for us tennis more and more , she said , sounding offended at the perception that america s tennis game was singularly defined by williams when people say that american tennis is dead and things like that , you know , you kind of take it a little personal , keys said someone went as far as to say that serena williams is the only american player , male or female , worth talking about or watching or anything like that so i took that a little personal but the fact remains that williams and her sister venus have been the global face of american tennis for 15 years , and their dominance has both obscured progress being made by the younger generation and set unrealistic expectations i think a lot of times people expect every american to live up to that standard , and that s not going to happen , keys said you know , there s only so many serena williams or chris evert or martina navratilovas i definitely think american tennis is getting better , and there are more people in the top 100 and competing in grand slams so i think everyone is kind of expecting a lot she added i think everyone is just a little impatient right now because there was definitely a lull for a while where there were n't many people but i think we 're definitely getting better i think in the next five years there will be a big group of americans zina garrison , who helps coach taylor townsend , another top american women s prospect , said that rather than looking for the next , tennis should focus on identifying the many we should be more worried about numbers getting more people out there than finding the next no 1 player in the world , she said , adding if you get more numbers , you 're going to get somebody to break through we still like to find the person who is supposed to be the next person , then we put so much pressure on them garrison understands the search for a star , saying , venus and serena are getting older they 're not going to be playing much longer , so we have to start looking but , she added , it puts too much pressure on kids will any of the latest crop of players emerge as stars , and is it really such a tragedy if none of them do \? as americans , we 're intrigued by youth and addicted to winning this toxic combination can ruin the very character we 're trying to build sloane stephens s emergence is a classic example of a toomuchtoosoon syndrome that defines our youth sports culture after a victory over serena williams at the australian open , stephens , 21 , became the tennis world s hot new commodity she was serena in waiting she has done little since then to justify the early coronation on wednesday she suffered her earliest loss at the , falling to 96thranked johanna larsson stephens compounded a poor showing on the court with a less than gracious performance at the news conference after the match , where she was alternately condescending and short by every account stephens is goodnatured and insightful , but since the victory over williams , she has come off as the young player spoiled by modest success fruit picked before its time with sensational players from around the world excelling , tennis does not need americans in order to be great america needs america to be great but the harm we do to our children in pursuit of that vanity is incalculable
in a statement last wednesday just hours after the government reported headlinegrabbing economic growth of 4 percent in the second quarter it would continue to stimulate the economy because , despite overall growth , the labor market remained weak the same day in kansas city , mo , president obama echoed the fed i'm glad that gdp is growing , and i'm glad that corporate profits are high , and i'm glad that the stock market is booming , he said , \( which it was before profittaking at week s end dented its performance \) but what i really want to see is a guy working 9 to 5 , and then working some overtime those cautionary views were validated on friday , when the employment report for july showed slower job growth , flat earnings , stagnant hours and stubbornly high longterm unemployment the challenge now , as always , is to translate official concern over the job market into change for the better the economy added 209 , 000 jobs last month , a decent enough figure in and of itself , but a slow start to the third quarter compared with the average monthly gain of 277 , 000 last quarter worse , july s relatively slow pace of growth may not be sustainable many of last month s job gains were in automobile manufacturing , which could reflect a statistical blip from shorterthanusual factory shutdowns in july rather than new positions added moreover , the upswing in the auto industry is tied to a surge in , an unstable foundation for future growth in addition , the sectors that generally add the most jobs each month all slowed in july from their pace in june , including bars and restaurants , retail , health care and temporary services as for the president s vision of a 40hour week plus overtime well , if only for the fifth straight month , the average workweek for most of the labor force was stuck at 337 hours factory overtime , once a mainstay in the lives of workingclass americans , dropped in july for the second straight month average hourly wages have , at best , kept pace with inflation over the past year pay is languishing , but working longer hours is not an option in its statement , the fed said it was basically a tossup whether the economy would speed up or slow down faster growth , however , generally requires a healthy real estate market and that requires a healthy job market , especially for younger workers but in july , the jobless rate for workers ages 25 to 34 was 66 percent , compared with 62 percent over all among young people who are working , many are in lowwage or parttime jobs , or jobs that otherwise do not make use of their education or experience so it is not surprising that the sale of new homes plummeted recently at the fastest pace in nearly a year sales of existing homes have risen , a positive sign but a questionable trend given the stillailing job market the most likely scenario is for the economy to continue to muddle along at an overall annual pace of 2 percent to 25 percent the fed has affirmed its commitment to keep interest rates low until the labor market recovers , but the real test of its resolve will come if and when inflation meets or exceeds its preferred annual rate of 2 percent in a sluggish economy with significant employment slack , continued stimulus policy would be called for even if inflation exceeded the target , but whether the fed will oblige is unknown as for mr obama , he seems to understand that with a republicandominated house and republican senators keen on winning a majority in the senate , he is on his own to push for change he can and should continue to issue executive orders to and for the federal contract work force he should work with the labor department on to reestablish a broad right to timeandahalf for overtime and he should continue to rally public support for democratic legislation to raise the minimum wage and the growing use of unpredictable parttime scheduling none of that is enough to counter significantly the forces responsible for job growth that is too weak , wages that are too low and workweeks that are too short for that , a functional political climate is needed , one in which leaders find compromise solutions to the nation s problems without that , the fed s modest prediction that the economy has an even chance of getting better may in fact be too optimistic
there s no avoiding the impression that the fix was in from the start on a provision in the federal spending bill passed on thursday by the house that repeals a part of the dodd frank financial reform law the law required the biggest banks to conduct some of their riskiest derivatives transactions in subsidiaries outside the cozy confines of federallyinsured institutions the repeal of the socalled pushout rule will mean that banks can continue to speculate secure in the knowledge that taxpayers stand ready to cover any catastrophic losses house republicans have never made any bones about their drive to repeal the pushout rule , while many congressional democrats have more quietly angled for repeal in 2013 , when 70 house democrats joined with house republicans to pass a bill to repeal the push out rule , their approval was spun as a freebie that is , the yes votes let democrats curry favor with the banks without actually giving the banks anything , since the bill was not expected to pass the senate the problem in the senate was not lack of highlevel democratic support for weakening dodd frank new york senator charles schumer , for one , in the past showed a willingness to delay and weaken some of the law s provisions the problem in 2013 was the political infeasibility of attempting outright repeal of a provision of dodd frank a democratic law in the democratically controlled senate fast forward to the lame duck session house republicans knew they would need democratic support to pass the spending bill , which gave democrats leverage over what went into it but democrats didn t pitch a fit over the repeal provision until after the public found out about it suddenly , house minority leader nancy pelosi was up in arms it s possible she was caught off guard by the repeal details or had a change of heart after the public weighed in with its own disapproval and outrage possible , but not probable repeal of the push out provision is a priority for the banks , and no one in washington with responsibility for wall street donations wants to defy them ms pelosi did express frustration with president obama , who urged passage of the spending bill despite the repeal provision they may have been having a real fight , but they may also simply have been playing their respective political roles meanwhile , senators with credibility on financial reform have raised substantive protest to the repeal , including elizabeth warren , richard durbin and sherrod brown republican david vitter , who has teamed up with mr brown in bankreform efforts , also condemned the repeal effort none of which is likely to derail its ultimate passage and signing into law
imagine a house ablaze now picture a team of firefighters pulling up to it they behold the flames shooting through its roof they feel its heat on their faces and they get in position to fight it with squirt guns that house is america , and those rescuers are the candidates in these misbegotten midterms we 're living through a chapter of uncommonly , when a majority of adults do n't think their kids will have as many opportunities as they did when there s waning faith in social mobility and a widening gap between rich and poor when our standing in the world is diminished and our sense of insecurity has intensified accordingly when the environment itself is turning on us and demanding the sorts of longterm adjustments we 've seldom been good at and yet nothing about the discussion during these long months of campaigning has fully reflected that or been scaled to it none of the candidates have spoken with the necessary urgency or requisite sweep no one has stepped forward with originality , authenticity and a pledge to tear up the dreary political script of recent years and lead us into a future that we 're ceasing to believe in in iowa , joni ernst and bruce braley talked of harleys , hogs and chickens in florida , charlie crist and rick scott bickered over a fan in colorado , mark udall s focus was more wombcentric than the handmaid s tale while i believe strongly in reproductive freedom and salute him for defending it , i also wish i could tell you , without intensive research , what sort of script he has for restoring this country s confidence but i do n't know the answer for him or for just about any of the other 2014 candidates i know where they stand on the minimum wage and maybe on immigration reform , though there s been a whole lot of waffling there i know that they think the islamic state is evil and ebola scary but a visionary plan \? a detailed route back to the optimism at the core of the american character \? i did n't catch those , so i 'd be wary of any party leader or pundit who tells you that there s a clear moral to the outcome of tuesday s voting , a bold lesson after a sometimes breathtakingly cynical campaign bereft of big ideas , few americans will actually be voting anything or anyone , at least in the congressional contests the midterms have had too little real substance to have too much predictive relevance in the los angeles times a month ago , the columnist doyle mcmanus drew attention to a poll that asked voters if they intended their choices to send a message to washington only 13 percent said they would be voting in support of republican policies , mcmanus an even smaller number said they would be voting in favor of democratic ideas the largest group of all , 42 percent , said they did n't have a bigger message in mind at all many of them wo n't even whichever politician they wind up voting for in senate race after senate race , they 're choosing between the lesser of evils at least as many voters have unfavorable as favorable views of both the democratic and republican candidates in iowa , in north carolina , in georgia and in kentucky , where mitch mcconnell , the republican , marveled recently at a sinkhole that had opened up in the state s moist earth i think of that maw as nature s response to the election , its attempt to wipe the slate clean , or rather swallow it whole and start from scratch it was in kentucky that the democratic aspirant , alison lundergan grimes , provided the election s defining moment , refusing to say whether she 'd voted for barack obama in 2008 and 2012 with an eye toward whatever calibrations might constitute a winning formula , she tossed character , honesty and any kind of mature conversation with voters to the side analysts of this election have cast it as a referendum on competence , a referendum on obama , a referendum on an economic recovery that s been slow and spotty there s some truth to each of those observations , and to the sum of them but if republicans wrest control of the senate , it will mostly reflect the particularities of the individual races and states themselves , and the larger takeaway , to the extent that there is one , will be the same as the takeaway from most of the last five elections the turnover in the chamber will be a retort to the status quo , which is a democratic senate majority , along with a democratic president for more than a decade , consistently , more americans have said that the country is on the wrong track than have said it s on the right one this is remarkable and in almost every election during that span , the party in control of the white house , the senate or the house of representatives has changed it s been a nearly constant seesaw , with a sustained message from voters what we have is n't working give us different if you 're the candidate of continuity and sameness , whether a republican or a democrat , you 're quite likely vulnerable that s why udall s aides raised a stink when his opponent , cory gardner , ran a tv commercial underscoring the generations of politicians in the udall family udall said it represented an outofbounds personal attack , which was ridiculous what it did was weld udall to the status quo , and that rightly spooked him being welded to the status quo obviously spooks hillary clinton as well , and that s why , if she runs for president , she 'll bang the first woman ever drum in a manner that she did n't last time around it s a way to argue that putting another democrat in the white house after obama is n't mere perpetuation the leaders of whichever party fares better than expected or at least better than the other in the midterms will talk a lot about 2016 , claiming not just victory but a proven connection with the zeitgeist and what americans really want your correct response to this inevitable aria of selfcongratulation will be laughter , or maybe tears , because what americans crave and fantasize about is difference of a magnitude and a passion you might even say an audacity that was absent from this election cycle here s a wager for 2016 , based not on 2014 but on our trudge through the doldrums and government sclerosis of so many years now the spoils will go to the candidate who comes to the conflagration with more than a toy and a piddling amount of water
slovyansk , ukraine ukrainian security forces and antigovernment rebels clashed on the edges of this rebelcontrolled city on monday as the acting president , oleksandr v turchynov , said roadblocks were being set up around ukraine s capital , kiev , because of fears of disturbances or violence during an emotionally charged holiday later in the week as many as 10 rebels and four soldiers were killed in the fighting , according to the official accounts from both sides , along with a woman who was shot while standing on an apartment balcony during a bloody firefight along the highway to slovyansk s east but at the end of the day the violence accomplished little for either side besides deepening resentments and anger and appearing to push the crisis further from a chance at peaceful resolution the rebels yielded a single checkpoint to the government , at rybkhoz , from which they withdrew during a morning advance by a ukrainian armored unit but the antigovernment forces still held slovyansk , where residents continued to fell trees and stack tires to create obstacles to any military push the most pitched fighting , at semyonovka , at the city s eastern border , ended with both sides pulling back with their wounded or dead , , and a gas station that was rocked by the explosion of a commercial propane tank the fighting there also included the civilian death , which is likely to fuel the city s building sense of anger and grief in kiev , the provisional government said vehicle checkpoints had been set up at strategic locations around the capital in anticipation of potential violence before a holiday on friday commemorating victory over the nazis in world war ii war is in effect being waged against us , and we must be ready to repel this aggression , mr turchynov said , announcing the roadblocks on monday in an interview on ukraine s channel 5 television station mr turchynov also said that parliament would meet in a special closed session on tuesday for a report by security agencies on measures to stabilize the country in a statement , mr turchynov urged all lawmakers to attend and said that important decisions will be taken related to the security of ukraine the government seemed to be stepping up its efforts to counter the prorussian disinformation campaign that has flooded the television airwaves in the country s east and portrayed the central authorities as illegitimate mr turchynov s office released a number of statements , including one that criticized efforts by those it called terrorists to enlist miners from eastern ukraine in antigovernment actions most of the residents of slovyansk , a small industrial city , have never experienced war , and in khimik , a neighborhood about a mile and a half from the battle , people crowded on the upperstory balconies of an apartment building to listen and watch as the two sides clashed at an intersection beside the railway crossing in semyonovka this curiosity proved fatal , according to sergey n sheptenko , when his wife , irina boevets , 30 , was struck by a bullet in the head mr sheptenko found her moments later , lying on her right side in a pool of blood standing with reddened eyes before his apartment door , he seemed in shock , describing a loss he had only begun to know there is no one , no one is home , he whispered , hoarsely only silence it was not clear whether ms boevets was targeted or struck by a stray bullet her husband said he suspected a sniper the fighting at semyonovka raged in the morning after rebels took up a position on the highway , one witness said the ukrainian government said the rebels ambushed a convoy , but the witness described it differently , saying that a patrol of armored vehicles attacked the new rebel position , killing many of them at a gas station near the intersection , ordnance appeared to strike a large storage tank , causing an explosion that set fire to a fourdoor hatchback car , knocked aside another tank and heaved debris that smashed the front end of a cargo truck the attendant , who said he was pressed flat to the floor as the station was rocked by the blast and hit with bullets , spoke with dismay i do n't know how we can resolve this , he said what steps can the ukrainian people take to stop the shooting \? we have children in andreyevka , where ukrainian forces took a bridge and subsequently withdrew from it last week , an explosion late in the morning set the bridge s guards scrambling rebels crouched along walls and in the vegetation nearby , saying they had been attacked by a helicopter none were wounded , thank god , said maksim , a former paratrooper who , like many fighters , withheld his last name arsen avakov , the acting interior minister , was present for part of the fighting , according to the interfaxukraine news agency he offered an explanation for the gradual tightening of the ukrainian forces around slovyansk , which he has called a blockade while militants remain sandbagged in official buildings inside , he said , the only tactic is to advance little by little toward the center the head of ukraine s national guard , stepan poltorak , was quoted as telling agence francepresse , they are doing all they can to make us resort to heavy weapons , but we wo n't do that in order to spare the civilian population in odessa on monday , burials began for the 46 people who died in street fighting and a fire three days before mourners stood around the open grave of one of the prorussian leaders , vyachislav markin , and then in turn took handfuls of black earth and cast them silently onto the coffin relatives sobbed and his supporters spoke of a man who had died before his time mr markin perished in the fire that burned a trade union building where prorussian activists had holed up after losing a street battle with proukrainian activists on friday with the threeday period of mourning declared by the city ending tuesday , mr avakov , the interior minister , said he had sent a newly formed police unit called kiev1 from the capital to odessa , in case fighting erupts again in a facebook post , mr avakov held police officials in odessa responsible for failing to prevent a prorussian mob from attacking a proukrainian rally , a confrontation that touched off the violence on friday the new police unit was drawn from the street activists who helped topple ukraine s government in february after months of demonstrations on a central plaza in kiev in favor of closer economic ties with europe and against corruption mr avakov said he had fired the entire leadership of the odessa police tensions remained high in odessa , with the sense that the street fighting of last week was not so much over as in abeyance with ukrainian flags flying about town and proukrainian groups clearly stronger in the streets , it was unclear if the prorussian group could muster the forces to mount another struggle to seize buildings or raise russian flags in public prorussian militants angry about their dead have posted the names and addresses of proukrainian activists online to invite revenge attacks
the cartoonist gilbert hernandez still recalls vividly the first time he saw zap comix as a boy it was issue no 2 , and it oozed with druggy phantasmagorias , sex , overthetop violence , sex , demons and , yes , sex it was funny , too , 52 pages of , as the cover promised , gags , jokes , kozmic trooths all for 50 cents i remember thinking , i'm going to go to hell for reading this , ' said mr hernandez , who created the muchpraised independent comic with his brothers in the 1980s the zap artists , they 're like these crazy children the naughtiest kids in the world but i enjoyed zap in a weird , lurid way and while it never really went away the most recent issue came out in 2004 zap , born in late 1967 in the fever dreams of r crumb , is emphatically back in a big way fantagraphics books of seattle in november is publishing the complete zap , a strikingly designed 500 hardcover boxed set of more than 1 , 100 pages not bad for a blackandwhite comic book series whose first issue cost a quarter in 1968 while the early issues stand as rowdy documents of the 1960s counterculture , zap was also more in reinventing the comic book , it set off legal battles and conversations over censorship , brought attention to cartoonists as artists , and set an example for generations of alternative comics creators like charles burns , , joe matt and the hernandez brothers the five volumes in the complete zap include issues 0 to 16 the final issue , no 16 , is being published for the first time a portfolio of zap covers , and an oral history as told by zap s artists but as the underground comix historian patrick rosenkranz writes in his introduction to the history be warned these books contain an incendiary collection of radical propositions and unsettling notions do not confuse them for a quaint relic from the longgone age of aquarius countercultural comics had appeared in alternative newspapers , but the arrival of zap no 1 in early 1968 with its kozmic kapers and freak out funnies strips was the moment comic books got psychedelicized and became comix , aimed at an adult , if stoned , audience within four issues , zap grew to a collective of seven artists and became the unofficial flagship of the comix movement , inspiring the publication of hundreds of undergrounds but none approached the quality of zap and its allstar lineup as mr crumb says in the oral history , they were the baddest gang of cartoonists ever to wield their crow quills together asked why he wanted to publish the complete zap , gary groth , fantagraphics' founder and publisher , said i consider zap one of the most important comics ever published it s a landmark in comic art the work is brilliant , and it stands for the underground movement it stands for the times zap changed the conception of what comics are capable of outside r crumb s lonely san francisco room in 1967 , the vietnam war continued to roil the nation as the summer of love gave way to late fall inside , mr crumb , burning up with drugfueled visions , was transforming cultural notions of comics and art there s a sweet crumb drawing in volume 5 of the boxed set that shows him with his pregnant first wife , dana , selling copies of zap no 1 from a baby carriage on the haight mr crumb looks ill at ease , dana putupon , and the san francisco hippies nonplused by this 25cent comic book we had no distributor , mr crumb said in a phone interview from his home in the south of france we were one step up from running it off on a mimeograph machine i had to explain to the head shop guys that it was a psychedelic comic book with the simple goal of just wanting to make a modest living doing comics , mr crumb wrote and drew the first two issues of zap , nos 0 and 1 , in late 1967 48 pages in all it was way lsdinspired , mr crumb said , and looking at it brings back that lsd feeling those blackandwhite epiphanies included characters like mr natural , whiteman , shuman the human and mr crumb s endlessly pirated keep on truckin' images a lot of ink has gone under the bridge since back then , he said but i'm grateful that this stuff still has a timely appeal sometimes , it looks like a different person did it i'm not that person anymore i was crazy i was depressed but the depression made me productive and mr crumb soon found out that his comics were speaking to kindred souls , like the popular rockposter artists rick griffin and victor moscoso , and the nebraska wild man s clay wilson , who enlisted for zap no 2 i was amazed they were interested , mr crumb said i worked in total isolation until then and by issue no 4 the zap lineup the seven samurai of the undergrounds was complete as gilbert shelton , and robert williams joined up their influences ranged from hieronymus bosch and the surrealists , to funny animal comics and vintage cartoons , to 1950s ec horror and crime comics and , who created mad for ec as a kid , i loved mad magazine , because it regurgitated 1950s america in an incredibly brilliant way , mr crumb says in the oral history and just as mad mapped out a screwball path for zap artists , zap did the same for later cartoonists zap paved several roads to what comics can be , said mr hernandez , whose latest graphic novels are bumperhead and loverboys and indie comics are indebted to that pondering zap s legacy during a phone interview , paul mavrides , who joined the crew after griffin died in a motorcycle crash in 1991 , laughed and said , all the blown minds left in its wake zap is the house that r crumb built but s clay wilson is its howling muse mr wilson threw down his filthy gauntlet to his fellow zapsters right away in no 2 with a onepage exercise in excess called head first starring his pervert pirates , it revels and rollicks in sex , radical dismemberment and cannibalism he showed us we had been censoring ourselves , mr moscoso said in a phone interview he blew the doors off the church wilson is one of the major artists of our generation little wonder the taboobreaking novelist william s burroughs once said , i have always found wilson s art hilarious , relevant and timely mr wilson s unhinged drawings , which robert williams called vulgarly lyrical , are a cross between bosch and walt kelly s pogo , by way of the most gruesome ec comics but mr wilson , who stopped drawing after a severe brain injury in 2008 , embraced his pornographic riffs sex sells , he says in the history , and i like drawing dirty pictures but not everyone admired how raw and feral zap was as its popularity grew its first 16 issues are said to have sold more than three million copies over the decades zap attracted unwanted attention it was part of a nationwide crackdown on the sale of undergrounds the poet lawrence ferlinghetti and his city lights bookstore in san francisco were even busted in 1969 for selling zap we got in a lot of trouble , mr williams said in a phone interview we were in the middle of a seditious act then there was the trouble with women as mr crumb , mr wilson , mr williams and their buddies unleashed their raging ids , relishing dark abysses of sex , drugs and violence , some of their female peers accused them of casual sexism and worse mr crumb nods toward their collective guilt , a bit tongueincheek , in the history as trina robbins says , i ruined comix by encouraging all the younger boy artists to be bad and do comics about their own horrible sex fantasies what , a cartoonist contemporary of team zap , said , as quoted in mr rosenkranz s indispensable history of the undergrounds , rebel visions , is i objected from the very beginning to all the sexism , to the incredible misogyny she went on , we 're talking about representation of rape and mutilation , and murder that involved women , as something funny but mr groth said you have to look at it historically they were liberating themselves from all restraints they were defiant , breaking taboos some female cartoonists , like the macarthur foundation fellow alison bechdel \( fun home \) and lynda barry \( one hundred demons \) , who first read zap as a seventh grader , cite the comic and mr crumb as crucial influences ms barry devotes three pages in her book what it is to discovering zap , noting that she once copied the whole of zap no 0 and , in a surprise , mr crumb smuggled his current wife , aline kominskycrumb who halfjokingly calls herself the yoko ono of the undergrounds into zap no 16 they share the work on the aline bob fullpage strips , the first time a female cartoonist has appeared in the comic an air of elegy hangs over zap s 84page final issue , no 16 the cover is mr crumb s , 46 years after his two solo blasts heard round the counterculture it includes last stories by mr wilson and mr rodriguez , who died in 2012 , and mr moscoso s muted back cover says , adi s it s like attending one last high school reunion but these venerable iconoclasts say they 're fine with closing up shop on zap after all , we 're dying , mr moscoso said this is n't walt disney enterprises , where it s going to go on after we die in the end , let s give the last word to mr crumb asked what he s most proud of about zap , which he lovingly called crude , homemade and artistic , he did n't even pause for a halfmoment it s authentic
call me obtuse , but i was surprised when president obama , running for reelection two summers ago , that costco is representative of what america is all about it is \? more than the marshall plan or the bill of rights \? or walmart \? well , now things are confusing because costco also in the state of the union address as a shining discountwarehouse on the hill but the meaningofamerica encomium was now on the rewards of capitalism americans understand that some people will earn more money than others , and we do n't resent those who , by virtue of their efforts , achieve incredible success that s what america s all about well , why not \? horatio alger the american dream the president was n't saying something that had n't been said before the trouble is , he keeps changing his story just two days later , in nashville , mr obama was , as our defining quality , not the big payday but educational opportunity now , giving every student that chance that s our goal that s what america is all about really \? two weeks earlier , in raleigh , nc , the president had a different formulation for americanness r d and that s what america is all about , he declared we have always been about research , innovation , and then commercializing that research and innovation so that everybody can benefit talk about about face any day now , he will say america is all about nougat on sundry occasions , the president has cited quality manufacturing , military service , freedom from discrimination , community service and succeeding from humble beginnings as the unique characteristic that explains our nation goodness gracious , hamlet dithered less but i'm not blaming mr obama for a podium reflex that s not what i'm about when it comes to turning every issue into a matter of fundamental americanism , the definer in chief has no monopoly on glib reductions of the national essence a swift survey finds that what america is all about is also ignoring educated elites \( thomas sowell \) condoleezza rice s career \( john mccain \) exceptionalism \( fred thompson \) amoral ambition \( william gaddis \) community service \( penny pritzker \) and gun ownership \( the american spectator \) the exercise seems to be something of a rorschach test , telling us more about the american than america itself take terry thompson , a man quoted last december by bloomberg news , who believes the detroit autoworker is what america is all about mr thompson is a detroit autoworker the impulse for reductiveness is like one of those stickon closet lights seldom very illuminating obviously , america is about many things political freedom , economic opportunity , the melting pot , cat videos , the cult of celebrity , the cult of the military , franchised inauthentic ethnic cuisine , super pacs and 89 brands of riding mower but none of them singularly defines the american way the question really is , what is america all about that is truly distinctive \? helping others less fortunate is a genuinely american impulse , but it ranks high in norway , too likewise , the notion of exceptionalism we may deem the american way , in peace and war , to be a cut above , but a similar sense of selfregard runs pretty high in serbia , i hear and let us not even discuss french chauvinism , the finest in the world to divine our one true essence , should we not settle on a list of defining institutions both transcendent and rare \? i humbly propose the following the constitution , nasdaq and costco
it will take a while to understand fully how the affordable care act affects the quality of health care and access to doctors in this country but a new offers encouraging reviews from people who signed up for private plans or medicaid during the first enrollment period from october 2013 through march 2014 the survey , sponsored by the commonwealth fund , a research group that tracks health care reform , conducted phone interviews with some 4 , 400 workingage adults around the country from april 9 to june 2 , shortly after the first open enrollment period ended it found that 78 percent of the newly insured were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their new insurance that included 73 percent of those who bought private health plans and 84 percent who signed up for medicaid it seems that once enrolled , whatever uncertainties or ideological opposition people might have to health reform largely melts away of the democrats , 85 percent were happy with the new insurance , as were 74 percent of republicans by the beginning of june , 60 percent of the adults with new coverage said they had used their plans to go to a doctor or hospital or fill a prescription , and 62 percent of that group said they would not have been able to afford care before getting this new coverage more than half of the adults said their plan included all or some of the doctors they wanted only 5 percent said none of their preferred doctors were included in their plans most of the newly insured people had no trouble finding a primary care doctor , and most waited less than two weeks for an appointment whether that will hold true when millions more patients flood into the market remains to be seen the survey found that by the end of the enrollment period in march , 95 million fewer adults were uninsured the largest gains in coverage were among young adults , ages 19 through 34 , latinos and lowincome adults the report also found that lowincome patients were much better off in states that have expanded their medicaid programs than in states that have not the affordable care act provided very generous federal matching funds for states to expand medicaid eligibility to those whose incomes fell below 15 , 856 for a single adult or 32 , 499 for a family of four last year yet about half the states , mostly led by republican governors or legislators , have refused to expand medicaid in states that have , the percentage of adults below the federal poverty level who are uninsured dropped to 17 percent from 28 percent that figure in the other states remained essentially unchanged at 36 percent many people who gained new insurance coverage reported that their health was fair or poor or that they had at least one chronic disease most said they were better off now than before even those who had no health problems said they were better off the reform effort is off to a very good start , especially in states determined to take full advantage of the new law
akron , ohio rory mcilroy was in the grips of the secondround yips when he sat down in florida in june for a casual meeting with jack nicklaus , the golfing great , who has taken a paternal interest in mcilroy s career in may , at a tournament that nicklaus hosts in ohio , mcilroy s secondround score had been 15 shots higher than his opening 63 nicklaus thought he might be able to help with what had become a troubling pattern , and in the course of their conversation , he made a few swings to demonstrate how mcilroy s hips were getting ahead of his hands on his downswing others had commented that mcilroy seemed to be getting stuck , but none of them had won 18 majors like nicklaus whatever nicklaus showed mcilroy , it clicked literally and metaphorically it s so funny , mcilroy , 25 , said saturday he got up out of his seat and started giving me this lesson , and his hip creaked since the start of july , mcilroy s swing has looked as fluid as a rushing river , and he has sunk the competition the reigning british open champion , mcilroy won his first start since claiming the claret jug as he came from three strokes off the pace sunday to defeat , the 54hole leader , at the bridgestone invitational closing with a fourunderpar 66 , his fourth consecutive sub70 score at firestone country club , mcilroy finished at 15under 265 , two strokes better than garc a \( 71 \) marc leishman closed with a 67 to finish third , at 12 under the victory was mcilroy s first in a world golf championships event it also returned him to no 1 in the rankings , a spot he surrendered in march 2013 to tiger woods , whose status for the pga championship and the ryder cup is in doubt after he withdrew from the bridgestone on sunday with back spasms mcilroy s victory march was slowed only by a morning rainstorm that caused a 75minute delay in the teeoff times of the final 21 groups woods , 38 , had already lost the top ranking to adam scott , who held it for 11 weeks now scott will be supplanted by mcilroy , who said it felt like a long time since i lost that no 1 spot , but it feels good to be back on the top hopefully i can keep it for a while mcilroy s 66 was nowhere near the low round of the day phil mickelson had 10 birdies while hitting only 11 greens in his closing 62 , which put him in a tie for 15th at 275 mickelson , who had opening rounds of 71 and 73 , saw his midas touch around the greens return he needed only 21 putts , the last of which was a 5footer for par that followed two highlightreelworthy shots mickelson s drive at the par4 18th traveled 300 yards and came to rest under a pine tree , perilously near a root the prudent shot would have been to pitch out mickelson mulled his options for so long , it was obvious he was picturing a shot with a little more panache when at last he asked for his utility club , his caddie , jim mackay , said , make sure you do n't hurt yourself mickelson used the club to hit a high majestic shot just an easy little strike , he said that landed on the fairway , 19 yards from the green he then chipped to 5 feet this was a big day for me heading into next week , mickelson said , referring to the pga championship , the year s final men s major i have a little momentum heading in , and i do n't feel like i'm searching as much mickelson , 44 , was scheduled to play the first two rounds of the pga with woods in a marquee grouping , a vintage version of mcilroy versus garc a but woods and mickelson may get no nearer than they were sunday when mickelson , from the 11th hole , saw woods walking down the ninth it looked like he was really in pain , mickelson said he added , i hope it s a muscle and nothing serious , because i'm really looking forward to playing with him even as mcilroy and garc a battled for the lead like two dogs over a bone , they walked the fairways side by side and kept up a conversation the pleasure they took in competing and in each other s company was palpable garc a displayed his best behavior after his worst shot , an errant drive on the third hole that knocked the diamond off a female spectator s ring he made sure to get her contact information , ostensibly to send her a replacement diamond , but in the only victory garc a could claim sunday , the original was found i was prepared to buy her one , garc a said referring to his girlfriend , he added , i do n't know how kathy would have felt about that , but other than that , it was ok garc a s 5 on the hole , coupled with mcilroy s 3 \( his third consecutive birdie \) , cost garc a the lead with a 15foot birdie putt at 9 , he moved back into a tie with mcilroy , who then made a birdie at 11 , after a 318yard drive , for the only cushion he required mcilroy quickly put the victory behind him going into valhalla in good form , he said , referring to the pga championship site , and try to get three in a row
dhanora , india in this sleepy village in eastern maharashtra , about 50 miles south of nagpur , the sense of desperation is palpable the dirt road that leads to the village passes through desolate fields , where the winter plantings of cotton , soybean and legumes have been ruined by unseasonal rains , harsh winds and an unusual hailstorm that hit this state and several others in february in all , 28 districts of maharashtra have seen crop devastation this winter , adding to the misery of farmers who were already struggling to cope with the impact of severe droughts in 2011 and 2012 vinayak deshmukh , technical officer to the state s commissioner of agriculture , said about two million hectares of farmland in maharashtra were affected , and local news reports estimated the damage to state crops amounted to about 50 billion rupees , or 829 million for bhagwanta haribhar mahajan , a 60yearold farmer from dhanora in the vidarbha region who was already 7 , 500 in debt after his wife s mouth cancer treatments and previous loans , seeing 80 percent of his soybean crops destroyed was too much to bear he was already having trouble paying his debt , which was equivalent to three years of income when mr mahajan failed to return home from the fields late last month , his son , pramod bhagwant mahajan , set out with a flashlight and neighbors to search for him they were nearly giving up hope when they spotted a towel and pair of slippers set neatly by a well in a field a short while later , his father s body emerged from the well , his legs bound together with rope i never thought he would take this step , said mr mahajan , 29 , a tall , stocky man with a look of steely determination in his eyes perhaps if this year our crop hadn t been ruined , maybe this wouldn t have happened since late february , 156 farmers in the state have committed suicide , according to kishor tiwari , president of the vidarbha jan aandolan samiti , a farmer activist group compared with the state s population of 112 million , the number of farmer suicides is a statistical blip , but the issue of farmer suicides is an emotional one in a country where 70 percent of the population depends on agriculture as a livelihood and where farmers are far more likely to kill themselves compared with the rest of the population in an election year , each farmer s death takes on an outsize importance in the past , maharashtra s small farmers have reliably voted for the indian national congress in the state , where it has a governing alliance with the nationalist congress party , and in national elections , helping it retain control of new delhi in 2009 but the party s rivals are tapping into the frustration felt by members of this voting bloc on the same day the elder mr mahajan committed suicide , narendra modi , the opposition party s candidate for prime minister , criticized the government s agrarian policies at a gathering of farmers in the vidarbha region meanwhile , some farmers in the vidarbha region are threatening to exercise the none of the above option on the ballot , which is being offered for the first time in the national elections most areas in vidarbha will vote thursday in the first of the threephase elections in maharashtra ramdas jagganath kaye , 74 , a farmer in dhanora , said all of the villagers were resolved to pick none of the candidates on the ballot none of these politicians are capable of running the government , he said across the region , farmers expressed frustration with the false promises made by politicians courting their vote these politicians , no matter what party , are only seen in this region when the time comes to vote , said sudhir chaple , 42 , a farmer in dhanora whose crop was damaged by the rain and hailstorm otherwise , it s been five years we haven t seen their faces around here they say , we will do this , we will change that , but then years pass by and everything remains the same the ruined crops could also contribute to higher food prices , which was one of the chief reasons for the congress party s defeat in state assembly elections last year mr deshmukh , the technical officer to the commissioner of agriculture , said that state residents were likely to pay more for grapes , pomegranates , mangoes , legumes , sorghum and wheat and that nationally there would be a price increase in sorghum and legumes because of the shortage on march 20 , a meeting of ministers of the central government decided that the national disaster response fund would provide 143 , 000 to maharashtra for damage to crops from the rains and hailstorm , according to reports from the press trust of india the agriculture ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment mr deshmukh said that the state had decided on a relief program that would provide assistance only to farmers who had suffered over 50 percent crop damage he said the government would pay a onetime monetary compensation of 416 per hectare for land under horticulture , 250 per hectare for irrigated land and 166 per hectare for nonirrigated but cultivated land used for field crops the state would waive the interest on crop loans worth a total of 4445 million and clear electricity bills worth 3317 million the distribution of aid was delayed because the state government had to seek special permission from the election commission to avoid the appearance of bribery in the period before the elections however , activists in the vidarbha region said that the money allotted to farmers rarely reached them and that when it did , it was often insufficient to cover the cost of seeds and fertilizers used on the land any aid , however , would come too late for mr mahajan s family renutai bhagwant mahajan , 50 , the wife of

washington many of the fans who stayed at nationals park until late saturday night , waiting for the end of washington s national league division series game against the , stood and waved towels and made as much noise as they could for hours , this had been a tense , dramatic affair jordan zimmermann and tim hudson had been locked in a pitchers' duel nationals manager matt williams had pulled zimmermann in the ninth , one out from a shutout , and the giants had tied the score on a pablo sandoval double off closer drew storen a close call at home plate on that play had nearly given the giants the lead it took the giants another nine innings to score again and record the teams tied the record for the longest game in major league postseason history in terms of innings and broke the record for the longest game by time , at 6 hours 23 minutes williams and asdrubal cabrera were ejected in the 10th and missed almost half the game in the 18th , the giants' brandon belt , who was 0 for 6 to that point , crushed a home run to right field , and his teammates mobbed him in the dugout the nationals put a runner on in the bottom half of the inning , but they could not muster anything more as the giants took a twogamestonone lead in this bestoffive series just a great ballgame to be a part of , giants manager bruce bochy said you are hoping that somebody gets ahold of one , and belt finally did that is a game that i will always remember the nationals now face elimination in game 3 , set to be played in san francisco on monday the nationals , who lost , had made an early exit in their last postseason trip , losing a division series in 2012 after finishing the season with the best record in baseball having finished with the best record in the nl this year , they are trying to avoid another embarrassing collapse maybe that was why nationals fans were sensitive about comments hudson made before the series in which he suggested that the nationals did not have the same grit as the giants the crowd booed loudly as hudson was introduced and again when he came to bat hudson , though , had spoken from experience he had made 31 career starts against the franchise , and his 18 wins against it were his most against any major league team in the third inning , with two outs and a runner on third , hudson challenged anthony rendon with a 11 sinker that rendon pulled for a single cabrera clenched his fist as he trotted home for the game s first run zimmermann , meanwhile , was starting to gain momentum zimmermann , who had thrown a nohitter to close out the regular season , was putting his fastball wherever he wanted , and the giants could not make solid contact still , in game 1 , the giants had set an nl record by extending their postseason winning streak to nine games surely , then , the nationals could not feel comfortable with a onerun lead after zimmermann recorded two quick outs in the ninth , he walked the giants rookie joe panik on five pitches no matter that he had retired the previous 20 batters in order or that he had not allowed a run in more than 20 innings or that he was one out away from finishing a threehit shutout williams pulled zimmermann , and the fans applauded him as he left but they sounded a bit uneasy asked why he took zimmermann out , williams said because if he got in trouble in the ninth or got a base runner , we were going to bring our closer in that is what we have done all year with three pitches from storen , zimmermann s work came undone posey singled on the first pitch then sandoval stroked a double to left field , scoring panik posey nearly scored , too , but the relay bryce harper to ian desmond to catcher wilson ramos nipped him at the plate the giants asked for a replay review , but the call was upheld i do n't know how they came up with their call , bochy said we saw the replay it looked like he was safe the scene recalled the nationals' 2012 collapse in game 5 of a division series against the st louis cardinals , storen came on in the ninth with a tworun lead and surrendered four twoout runs , effectively ending the nationals' season the crowd dwindled on saturday as the game wore on many of those who were not standing slouched in their seats and shoved their hands into their jackets for eight innings , from the 10th to the 17th , each team managed two hits yusmeiro petit pitched six scoreless innings for the giants by the bottom of the 18th , most of the fans were standing they clapped and chanted with what was left of their voices just after midnight , jayson werth flied out for the 108th and final out of the game i like this group against anybody in baseball , hudson said i do n't care who we 're playing i do n't care who s on the mound for the other team he added , who 'd have thought we 'd come in here and win the first two \? in the nationals' clubhouse , the players quietly packed their belongings to extend the series , they will have to beat the giants' ace , madison bumgarner , on monday i'm sure it s going to be a quiet flight , zimmermann said

washington in the skies above , the pentagon s armed have stopped flying , a result of the ban on american military drone strikes imposed by the government there after a number of botched operations in recent years killed yemeni civilians but the s drone war in yemen continues in , the cia remains in charge of drone operations , and may continue to be long after american troops have left  and in , it is the cia rather than the pentagon that is running a program to arm and train syrian rebels a concession to the jordanian government , which will not allow an overt military presence in the country just over a year ago , the cia s newly nominated director , said at his confirmation hearing that it was time to refocus an agency that had become largely a paramilitary organization after the sept 11 attacks toward more traditional roles carrying out espionage , intelligence collection and analysis and in a speech last may in which he sought to redefine american policy toward terrorism , expanded on that theme , announcing new procedures for drone operations , which white house officials said would gradually become the responsibility of the pentagon but change has come slowly to the cia some might want to get the cia out of the killing business , but that s not happening anytime soon , said michael a sheehan , who until last year was the senior pentagon official in charge of special operations and now holds the distinguished chair at west point s  a number of factors including bureaucratic turf fights , congressional pressure and the demands of foreign governments have contributed to this delay at the same time , mr brennan is facing a reckoning for other aspects of the cia s role at the forefront of the secret wars the united states has waged since 2001 the declassification of a scathing report by the senate intelligence committee about the agency s detention and interrogation program will once again cast a harsh light on a period of cia history mr brennan has publicly disavowed the justice department has been drawn into a dispute between the agency and the committee , and is looking into a charge by senator dianne feinstein , the committee s chairwoman , that the agency broke the law by monitoring computers of committee staff working on the report before taking charge of the cia last march , mr brennan had spent four years as mr obama s top counterterrorism adviser , a job that put him in charge of the targeted killing operations that became a signature of the obama administration s approach to terrorism it also made mr brennan who before working for mr obama had spent 25 years at the cia a powerful influence on a president with no experience in intelligence american officials said that in that role mr brennan repeatedly cautioned mr obama that the cia s counterterrorism mission threatened to attenuate the agency s other activities , most notably those of penetrating foreign governments and analyzing global trends during his confirmation hearings , mr brennan obliquely criticized the performance of american spy agencies in providing intelligence and analysis of the arab revolutions that began in 2009 , and said the cia needed to cede some of its paramilitary role to the pentagon the cia should not be doing traditional military activities and operations , he said but now mr brennan is in charge of a counterterrorism apparatus that has steadily grown in budget , manpower and influence for more than a decade while officials said that mr brennan has pushed for more resources to counter traditional adversaries like russia and china , as well as newer threats like , the agency s counterterrorism center , known as the ctc , remains a powerful force both inside the agency and on capitol hill i think that most of the cia is behind the changes , but the ctc community has grown dramatically since 9 11 and is fighting to keep its turf , mr sheehan said and , they 've been somewhat successful in that regard , especially with the drone programs influential lawmakers from both parties have fought to protect the cia s role in the drone wars and prevent the proposed shift of the bulk of drone operations to the pentagon both ms feinstein and representative mike rogers of michigan , chairman of the house intelligence committee , have urged mr brennan to push back against the white house policy announced last may , citing what they regard as the pentagon s poor performance in lethal operations outside of iraq and afghanistan a number of bungled drone strikes carried out by the joint special operations command in yemen led the government there in recent months to temporarily ban drone strikes by the military , which are launched from an american base in djibouti officials said that the ban , not previously reported , came after a military drone strike in december killed a number of civilians who were part of a wedding procession in a desolate region south of yemen s capital , sana meanwhile , the cia continues to wage its own drone war in yemen , launching the unmanned planes from saudi arabia in pakistan , where the cia also is in charge of the drone program , the pace of strikes has declined sharply , and there have been none since the government in islamabad formally entered peace talks with the pakistani taliban , according to the , a group that tracks drone strikes but american officials said that the drone program there could continue for years , and pakistan s government has long insisted that it be run by the cia , not the american military this was one of the terms of the deal reached a decade ago between the bush administration and pervez musharraf , then the president of pakistan , who said he would allow armed drone strikes in the country s tribal areas only if they were conducted as a cia covert action and not acknowledged by either country for pakistan to agree to any changes in this arrangement , the united states would most likely have to agree to integrating pakistan s military into the drone operations a white house spokeswoman said there had been no change in policy since president obama s speech last may announcing changes to the targeted killing policy the plan is to transition to these standards and procedures over time , in a careful , coordinated and deliberate manner , said caitlin hayden , the spokeswoman i'm not going to speculate on how long the transition will take , but we 're going to ensure that it s done right and not rushed it was during the string of revolts across the arab world several years ago that concerns first surfaced that the years of focus on targeting terrorists had undermined the cia s ability to forecast and analyze global events in egypt , the agency had few sources beyond the country s intelligence chief and one of the agency s closest partners in the middle east , mr suleiman was not about to give the cia an honest assessment of the fragility of president hosni mubarak s government responding to a written question from the senate intelligence committee during his confirmation process , mr brennan said that with billions of dollars invested in cia over the past decade , policy maker expectations of cia s ability to anticipate major geopolitical events should be high recent events in the arab world , however , indicate that cia needs to improve its capabilities and its performance still further the previous year , a panel of advisers had warned mr obama that american spy agencies were overly focused on paramilitary operations , at the expense of intelligence collection in the middle east , china and other locations philip d zelikow , a former member of the panel , called the report a very broad critique of the cia , and said the agency should not be carrying out drone strikes i think these kind of military operations over the long haul are best confined to the department of defense , mr zelikow said in recent weeks , the heads of several intelligence agencies have faced accusations from lawmakers that american spies and analysts were caught by surprise when russia swiftly annexed crimea particular criticism has been reserved for the defense intelligence agency , responsible for intelligence collection about foreign militaries , for concluding that russian troop movements near the ukraine border were unlikely to lead to an invasion of the crimean peninsula even if the cia eventually does give up the work of firing missiles and dropping bombs in farflung regions of the earth , mr brennan insists that its counterterrorism mission will endure despite rampant rumors that the cia is getting out of the counterterrorism business , nothing could be further from the truth , the cia director said during a speech last month at the council on foreign relations the agency s covert action authorities and relationships with foreign spy services , mr brennan said , will keep the cia on the front lines of our counterterrorism efforts for many years to come
diego forlan was one of the top scorers at the 2010 world cup and played for some of the biggest clubs in the world manchester united and inter milan before he signed in late january with cerezo osaka in japan but even with that pedigree , the uruguayan may not be the most significant new player in the new jleague season that accolade could belong to the indonesian forward irfan bachdim if bachdim , 25 , succeeds with his new club , ventforet kofu , it will be a huge lift to the jleague s concerted attempts to become a force throughout asia in general , and southeast asia in particular the asia project , as the jleague has called it , started in 2012 and seems to be bearing fruit in january , the jleague signed an official partnership with the indonesia federation to promote the exchange of players and coaches and to help grow soccer in the country of about 240 million it was the sixth such deal that the league has made in the region , along with malaysia , vietnam , myanmar , singapore and cambodia many japanese companies have been targeting southeast asia , and the jleague is trying to do the same , said kei koyama of the league s asia strategy office we are trying to increase the fan base of the jleague while at the same time helping asian soccer develop , which benefits everyone southeast asia may be the most passionate part of the continent when it comes to soccer , but its achievements lag behind the love none of its teams have appeared at the world cup since 1938 , when indonesia participated as dutch east indies no nation qualified for the 16team asian cup , the continent s quadrennial tournament , in 2011 , and the same looks likely to happen for the 2015 competition there are 600 million people in the region , and when it comes to international soccer , they largely are loyal to english clubs manchester united , arsenal , liverpool and chelsea regularly visit to play exhibition games there in between the summer tours , however , contact is minimal , and japan is looking to fill the gap the english premier league is huge in southeast asia , koyama admitted we are not trying to follow that , and we are more interested in collaborating with local leagues top players from the region will go to japan , and people will start paying more attention the response from the indonesian media to the arrival of bachdim has been encouraging , but such interest will only endure if the attacker makes the field on a regular basis while koyama insists that southeast asia has players of sufficient quality to adapt to the jleague , which is widely recognized as the best on the continent , there are no guarantees that they will shine or settle down le cong vinh , vietnam s biggest star , played 11 games on a shortterm loan with consadole sapporo in japan s second tier in 2013 the striker impressed enough for the club to offer 240 , 000 to make the move permanent , but he left in december , saying he wanted to return home it is important for the asian project that the deal for bachdim , who was born in the netherlands to a dutch mother and an indonesian father , works out , though he did not play in the first game of the season , a 40 loss at home to kashima antlers this is a new step in my life and my career , bachdim said in a statement after the deal was announced it was always my dream to come to the higher stages of asia now i 've reached that goal so now i hope to play as many games as possible and represent indonesia in japan i hope that my move will introduce japanese football to other indonesian players so hopefully , it will open a few doors and they may come and follow me an advantage that the jleague has over its english counterpart is the fact that its level of play , while recognized as the best on the continent , is attainable for players from all of southeast asia the fact it is an asian league means there is a realistic chance of our players doing well , said jason chua , marketing manager of the singapore fa if singaporeans played in the jleague , there would be immense interest bachdim s moves will be watched at home , as jleague games are set to be broadcast in indonesia as part of a new japanese television channel jleague games are already being broadcast on dedicated sports channels in other countries in southeast asia the league has sold broadcasting rights to an agent in the region for an undisclosed sum , but with the contract expiring at the end of 2014 , there is an eagerness to increase its popularity to ensure the next contract is more lucrative but it is not all about taking players to japan , and officials are keen to stress that the benefits go both ways soccer may be very popular in southeast asia , but the national teams are not yet good enough , said koyama we can help with our knowhow of how to build a successful league in addition to the collaborations between the jleague and national federations , there are six partnerships between jleague clubs and their counterparts in southeast asia , with more expected soon japanese coaches are increasingly active in the region kokichi kimura is in charge of laos national team and four thai clubs have japanese coaches , helping to raise standards in that country in singapore , the japan fa and jleague held classes in november for local coaches the jleague is the standard bearer as far as asia is concerned , said chua from marketing , to sponsorships and the academies , they are streets ahead what was really impressive was their execution they had a vision and a plan and they saw it to fruition the partnership creates opportunities for coaches , players and clubs to learn and develop
washington gen qassim suleimani , the shadowy commander of s paramilitary quds force , flew to this week with dozens of his officers to advise the country s beleaguered leadership about how to blunt the advance of militant forces on baghdad , american officials said friday in meeting with general suleimani , the iraqis are hosting the mastermind of iran s strategy in iraq when iraqi shiite militias trained by iran fought american troops the general is also the current architect of iranian military support in syria for president bashar alassad the contact suggests that the iraqis see the possibility of significant aid from iran as a means of pressuring the united states to come to iraq s defense with aid of its own and it highlights the complex web of alliances brought to the fore in the current crisis both the united states and iran , traditional antagonists , see it in their interest to come to the aid of an embattled partner to repel the advance of the islamic state of iraq and syria , or isis clearly , any arrival and activation of iranian military personnel on the ground in iraq would be extremely significant , symbolically but also practically , said charles lister , a visiting fellow at the brookings doha center in qatar the terrorism threat in iraq is perceived strongly by both iran and the us the american officials who described general suleimani s visit to iraq spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing information in classified intelligence reports but officials on friday dismissed any notion that the united states and iran were formally coordinating their efforts to counter the isis threat we 're not talking to the iranians about iraq , marie harf , a state department spokeswoman , told reporters what we 've said is that all of iraq s neighbors , including the iranians , need to not do things to destabilize the situation even further , to not try to promote any sectarian tensions mr lister said it was unlikely that both iran and the united states could play an active role in countering militancy in iraq at the same time , but the strangebedfellows element of the situation had led even iran and israel bitter historical enemies to find common cause everybody has an interest in checking isis , said amos yadlin , a retired general and former head of israeli military intelligence who is now executive director of israel s institute of national security studies mr yadlin warned that the united states should not let any shared interest it has with iran in the current crisis cloud its judgment as western nations negotiate to get iran to abandon its  if the price for getting cooperation on isis is giving iran a free pass on the nuclear issue , then israel is worried , he said american intelligence and military officials said iran had sent some weaponry and equipment to iraq , but discounted news reports on friday that the quds had sent hundreds of troops to reinforce the iraqi army , whose northern divisions have folded in the face of the sunni militants but american officials said they were monitoring the reports closely , expressing concerns that sending shiite militias into iraq would only further destabilize a rapidly deteriorating security situation in the country we encourage all of iraq s neighbors , including iran , to play a constructive role , rear adm john f kirby , the pentagon press secretary , told reporters on friday asked what such a role might entail , admiral kirby said they could stop supporting extremist networks , right \? that s one thing a senior iraqi official on friday warned , however , that his country might be forced to turn to iran for military help if none were forthcoming from the united states even as he insisted he was unaware of any iranian military units in his country at the moment the official , who is an adviser to iraq s prime minister , nuri kamal almaliki , said that the iraqi government wanted air support and intelligence sharing , in particular , from the united states what changes this is if the us does not help , iran will come in and this is really dangerous , the adviser said if they do n't help i do n't think iran will let the iraqi government collapse they will fight and fight very hard the iraqi official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to make press statements , was severely critical of the obama administration for its handling of the iraq crisis , and for failing to better prepare the country s military for an emergency more than a year ago , general suleimani assured mr maliki in a meeting in baghdad that if iraq was ever in jeopardy , mr maliki could mobilize iraqi shiite militias to fight on behalf of the government , an american official said these would be similar to the socalled special groups iraqi shiites trained by the iranian quds force in iran that battled the americans during the iraq war after the 2003 american invasion of iraq , general suleimani took on the mission of expanding iran s influence in the country , tying down the american military and , ultimately , encouraging its exit paramount objectives for an iranian government that was determined to be a major power in the region and that felt threatened by expanding american military presence on its western and eastern flanks gen david h petraeus , who came to know the quds force commander s influence when he served in iraq , once described general suleimani as a truly evil figure in a letter to robert m gates , then the defense secretary in another letter , he acknowledged the influence that general suleimani had brought to bear in iraq the most sobering surprise of the week was probably the extent of direct iranian involvement in iraqi political intrigue , general petraeus wrote in an april 2008 letter to mr gates even as the quds force under general suleimani armed and trained shiite militias in iraq , he hosted some of iraq s most senior politicians by stoking violence and then mediating the conflict , former american officials say , he could make himself indispensable and keep the iraqis off balance in 2011 , the united states treasury department put general suleimani on its sanctions list because american officials said he had been involved in a plot to kill the saudi ambassador to washington
suddenly , dave chappelle , the great disappearing man of comedy , is everywhere he s cracking jokes on latenight television with david letterman and jimmy fallon , giving a quotation to gq magazine and even on today his welcome return is surely being made at the expense of some mystique once you chat with matt lauer while holding a handmade sign plugging your new shows , your days as a reclusive rebel are over that shift is reflected in his comedy his performance wednesday night at radio city music hall , the first of a muchballyhooed , seemed to make an effort to move past his on comedy central in 2005 i saw him perform four times last year , but this was a more conventional , less introspective set it was often hilarious as you would expect from one of the greatest comedians of his generation and a year of steady performing has tightened his jokes and polished his act , but maybe too much so he s streamlined or discarded some of his ambling , poetic yarns , stopped indulging in elaborate riffs and turned epic tales into more traditional , jokedense set pieces he still has moments of unexpectedly explosive line readings , but not as many as before he s been on tour a long time , and it feels that way as beautiful as it may be , radio city music hall is a cavernous room that swallows up standup comedy it s way too large to get the charged atmosphere and acoustics of the best comedy clubs , and it s particularly ill suited to mr chappelle never a kinetic performer , mr chappelle , who has always had an intimate , even offhand style , has become even more static and low energy soon after emerging onstage , wearing tight black clothes and smoking a cigarette , he placed himself in his spotlight and stayed there for most of the show , occasionally wandering off to get a new cigarette he made fun of his own comeback , calling it ill conceived and tedious , at times , then rehashed the moment he in hartford last year in response to heckling he made glancing mention of leaving his comedy central show and the rumors surrounding it \( the only place i feel comfortable talking is at the illuminati christmas party , he said , referring to some more outlandish theories about why he left \) but he steered clear of the allegorical tales he was that seemed like parables about regret now he s doing more sex jokes and stories of fatherhood mr chappelle presents himself as an overgrown kid of a dad unlike the parenthood jokes of bill cosby and louis c k , mr chappelle s do n't aim for you to identify with his exasperation or failures his goal is not to make you see some ordinary thing in a new way so much as to follow him as he maps out his perspective on a bizarre story some of his best material has always been about celebrities in scandal countless comedians have done michael jackson jokes , but none have been better than the bit on mr chappelle s last special now he takes aim at paula deen , rob ford and donald sterling in jokes that play like sketches scenes envisioning what would happen if donald sterling had told his players about his tape before the story broke , or if mr chappelle had asked ms deen to be his personal chef are reminders of what a great comic actor mr chappelle can be and they are also reminders of his gift for finding knowing , skeptical takes on race on the controversy over mr sterling , he adopts a sardonic tone it was revealed in america that an 80yearold white man has racist tendencies , he said in mock surprise did n't see that coming but while there were many sharp bits , they rarely built momentum the show wandered and strangely fizzled at the end , squandering several big laughs that would have made strong closing jokes at his best , mr chappelle weaves long stories , finding laughs before and after the joke when he introduced a bit as one of the worst he had ever written , he seemed to use it as a challenge , establishing the premise of a friend who pitches him terrible movie ideas with precise characterization and a sense of suspense his savvy opening act , tony woods , was an older , more established comic in washington when mr chappelle was just getting started , and in comedy circles , many see mr woods s laidback , looselimbed style as an influence on mr chappelle whereas mr woods still laughs at his own jokes , even when they fail , mr chappelle has adopted a more somber tone last year , he often giggled at his own jokes and ran downstage after one that particularly tickled him but he appears less joyous now this can give his comedy an unusual heft that pays off , but he can also seem remote mr chappelle also sometimes seemed so assured that he appeared to be phoning it in , running through jokes , some of which were a little musty , like the one that ended with a ralph nader reference and when it came to president obama , mr chappelle never found a fresh angle on him being a rich black dude is like wearing an itchy sweater , he said toward the end of the show it keeps you warm , but it s not quite comfortable it s a good line , but it resonated more when he said it to james lipton during his 2006 interview on inside the actors studio \( mr lipton , incidentally , introduced the opening act \) mr chappelle also told a joke about men finding it difficult to report having been raped , which has been in his repertoire for many years there s nothing wrong with bringing back jokes louis c k may regularly toss out material , but jerry seinfeld mixes old and new jokes whereas mr seinfeld mastered a certain consistent showbusiness salesmanship , mr chappelle s comedy has different strengths restless ambition , an improvisational instinct and a hardearned sense of danger he s not a reliable old pro and here s hoping he never becomes one
underscoring everything is the tension between the black and hispanic inmates , and the swelling power of vee , who is by now well established as litchfield s own cruella de vil the episode opens with some issues in spanish harlem sewage begins to gurgle up from the shower drains in the hispanic block gloria mendoza , who replaced red leading the kitchen , asks if the hispanic inmates can use the ghetto , or the showers that black inmates use vee replies , my girls are not inclined to offer special privileges your girls \? mendoza says when did that happen \? a very good question , because she does seem to have amassed power swiftly taystee seems fully in her fold again , even poussey no longer seems wary , and crazy eyes is following vee around like a puppy \( a dalmation , presumably \) the black inmates mildly mock vee for her in my day , black women ran the joint nostalgia but they increasingly seethe over slights , local and societal \( the racial tensions are played to good humor when the hispanics discover that the water pressure is better in the ghetto , one says , it s like they re getting special privileges , and we re the black people \) the hispanic inmates in the kitchen ruin the food for the black inmates with too much salt the black prisoners , in turn , tie the hispanic women s boots together in an overwhelming knot at that , mendoza orders vee into the bathroom to work it out but just when you expect a confrontation , vee begins to quiver i thought we could be friends , she tells mendoza she complains of the burden of the younger black women they want me to be some kind of den mother she tells mendoza that her camp can use the black bathroom without incident but she needs something in return taystee and watson want to work in custodial , so two others have to move out mendoza agrees she ll talk to caputo to have them moved to the kitchen as mendoza walks out , vee s crocodile tears dry up , replaced by a crooked grin red is the wise one increasingly this season , it seems she played you ! she tells mendoza once she discovers the girls have been moved from custodial so the big question going forward is what is vee up to \? mendoza is the star of this episode s flashbacks , which are set off by her encounters with vee but the connection between present and past is not as obvious as in earlier episodes is the common thread mendoza s fear of trusting the wrong people \?

do we suspect it s not that simple \? put your predictions but no spoilers , please in the comments
in architecture , everyone s a critic one of us , steven , was recently driving down elliott avenue in charlottesville , va , his hometown , with his 88yearold mother they passed a house designed and built by architecture students at the university of virginia to steven , an architect , this model for affordable housing a tough pair of stacked boxes , sheathed in corrugated metal was a bold design statement but to his mother s eye , the house was a blight on the landscape , an insult to its historic neighbors it looks like somebody piled a couple of boxcars on top of each other , then covered them up with cheap metal and whatever else they could find at the junkyard ! she said it s easy to dismiss mrs bingler as an unsophisticated layperson but that s the problem for too long , our profession has flatly dismissed the general public s take on our work , even as we talk about making that work more relevant with worthy ideas like sustainability , smart growth and resilience planning we 've confronted this problem before , with the backlash against what was seen as soulless modernism in the 1960s and '70s but our response , broadly speaking , was more of the same , dressed differently postmodernism , deconstructivism and a dozen other isms that made for vibrant debate among the professionals but pushed everyone else further away and we 're more insulated today , with an archipelago of graduate schools , magazines and blogs that reinforce our own worldview , supported by a small number of wealthy public and private clients the question is , at what point does architecture s potential to improve human life become lost because of its inability to connect with actual humans \? in 2007 steven s firm , concordia , was one of 13 invited to new orleans by the foundation to create prototypes for sustainable , affordable homes in the lower ninth ward , a neighborhood devastated by hurricane katrina early in the process , make it right s founder , brad pitt , invited a few returning residents to critique the designs , most of which tried to take a basic form , the singlefamily home , and squeeze it into the latest style , with little consideration of local needs or the local vernacular architecture the residents were n't impressed , and asked perfectly logical questions what s with the flat roofs you know it rains a lot here , right \? architecture , of the capital a variety , is exceptionally capable of creating signature pieces , glorious oneoffs we 're brilliant at devising sublime \( or bombastic \) structures for a global elite who share our values we seem increasingly incapable , however , of creating artful , harmonious work that resonates with a broad swath of the general population , the very people we are , at least theoretically , meant to serve thus , a paradox while architects design a tiny percentage of all buildings , our powers of selfcongratulation have never been greater although the term starchitect has become something of an insult , its currency within celebrity culture speaks to our profession s broad but superficial reach highprofile work has been swallowed into the great media maw , albeit as a cultural sideshow occasionally diverting but not relevant to the everyday lives of most people this might be acceptable if our only role were to serve those able to afford our services and the world would be a drearier place without fallingwater , the guggenheim bilbao and the sydney opera house the problem is n't the infinitesimal speck of buildings created by celebrity architects \( some arresting , some almost comic in their dysfunction \) , but rather the distorting influence these projects have had on the values and ambitions of the profession s middle ranks we 've taught generations of architects to speak out as artists , but we have n't taught them how to listen so when crisis has called upon our profession to step up in new york , for example , post9 11 , and in new orleans after katrina we have failed to give the public good reason to trust us in china and in other parts of asia , western architects continue to perform their oneoff magic , while at the same time repeating many of the urban design catastrophes of the previous century , at significantly larger scales architecture s disconnect is both physical and spiritual we 're attempting to sell the public buildings and neighborhoods they do n't particularly want , in a language they do n't understand in the meantime , we 've ceded the rest of the built environment to hacks , with sprawl and dreck rolling out all around us it was n't always like this for millenniums , architects , artist and craftspeople a surprisingly sophisticated set of collaborators , none of them conversant with architectural software created buildings that resonated deeply across a wide spectrum of the population they drew on myriad styles that had one thing in common reliance on the physical laws and mathematical principles that undergird the fundamental elegance and practicality of the natural world these creative resources transcend style they not only have wide aesthetic appeal , but they 're also profoundly human , tied to our own dna they 're the reason both philip johnson and the proverbial little old lady from dubuque could stand beneath the rose window at chartres and share a sense of awe to get back there , we must rethink how we respond to the needs of diverse constituencies by designing for them and their interests , not ours we must hone our skills through authentic collaboration , not slick salesmanship , reevaluate our obsession with mechanization and materiality , and explore more universal forms and natural design principles not all architects are equally proficient at producing seminal work but we do have access to the same set of tools and inspirations and let s be honest reconnecting architecture with its users rediscovering the radical middle , where we meet , listen and truly collaborate with the public , speak a common language and still advance the art of architecture is long overdue it s also one of the great design challenges of our time
medell n , colombia most everyone agrees the only thing worse than killing is being killed if our lives are threatened , we have the right to defend ourselves , with force if necessary in a civilized society , that defense is delegated to the state but not all of us , apparently , live in that kind of civilized society colombia in the 1990s saw the rise of vigilante selfdefense groups in its impotence and desperation at not being able to rapidly win the war against the guerrilla army \( which was essentially a drug cartel \) and against the drug lord pablo escobar s private army , the state gave the green light to these groups called convivir they were made up of agricultural laborers , trained by soldiers , and financed by landowners and agribusinesses when they began to extort money from the very businessmen who were financing them , they were declared illegal but it was already too late they had become clandestine paramilitary groups , using the same weapons as those they were fighting kidnapping , murder of innocents , drug trafficking what has been going on these last few months in mexico , in the western state of michoac n , makes me fear that the same thing is happening there today autodefensas have organized to drive out the vicious local drug cartel , called the knights templar after first demanding that the vigilantes disband , the government of president enrique pe a nieto has now sanctioned them as part of the rural defense corps at least nominally under the control of the military this is how it happens the army , with the blessing of the central authorities , looks for an ally , a lesser evil among the local powers compared with the cruel and bloodthirsty knights templar , the selfdefense groups have popular support and are allowed to operate meanwhile , the government ignores the fact that some of these vigilantes might be financed by the enemies of the knights templar for example , rival drug gangs or another cartel from the neighboring state of jalisco the government allows the vigilantes to act for a while , but when it tries to come back in , the selfdefense groups will have turned into a real armed power with whom the government will have to make a pact , for without them the state wo n't be able to assert its authority mexico , like several latin american countries , is able to guarantee security and the rule of law only in certain zones the lifeblood of law and order manages to flow near the heart of power , around the big cities , but the farther away we get , the weaker the pulse , and in some places there is none at all police officers are few and corrupt , judges live under threat from local despots and strongmen , and the legitimate authorities have been paid off by illegal ones it s like the american wild west , but with 21stcentury armaments , private armies funded by the torrential flow of money from drug trafficking , and no prospect of a righteous sheriff riding in to restore calm sometimes the united states which understands itself so well , but badly misunderstands latin american realities asks governments of its friendly southern neighbors to wage heroic battles it asks for elimination of illicit crops , total war on drugs or extermination of guerrilla forces the most obedient governments ignore what might be real solutions like cutting off the source of the cartels' enormous wealth by legalizing drugs and instead attempt to carry out these requests they send their national armies to undertake the thankless task of fighting against their own compatriots that s what felipe calder n , mexico s previous president , tried but these wars to the death always fail what they generate is local powers defending themselves by arming to the teeth , and outlying territories turning into battlefields where life is impossible for defenseless civilians the legitimate economy and tourism disappear , death tolls soar \( to around 80 , 000 in mexico \) , and the final winner , inevitably , is not the state but some local narcodictator with his own army of mercenaries this is what we learned in colombia when the state is not present , it is local tyrants who take power and brutally impose their rules , which are nothing more than the defense of their privileges the old hobbesian concept , that the natural state of mankind is that man is a wolf to man , seems confirmed in these involuntary latin american anarchist experiments the strongest and richest wolf \( from trafficking drugs or illegal mining \) dominates the other wolves of course , every country is different but i fear that today mexico is making the same mistake colombia did a quarter of a century ago the vigilantes appear to be a cure they are seen as saviors but in reality they are part of the illness , one more illegal army , acting without restraints and financed by dirty money in colombia , the selfdefense groups were eventually pursued until , in 2003 , 25 , 000 of them were forced to demobilize since they were also drug traffickers , a few top paramilitary ringleaders ended up being extradited to the united states but their legacy persists their descendants still live in colombia and still have power now they 're called criminal gangs , and they are still practicing extortion and murder financed by illegal mining and drug money the vigilantes might begin by killing kidnappers , drug dealers and extortionists , but soon they begin killing their relatives , and then their friends , or those they think are their friends , and then the friends' families , until everyone is suspect and they might come knocking at your own door , as happened to us in colombia as happened to my own father , when he was gunned down in the streets of medell n to allow private armies , even if they are supposedly for selfdefense , is to create a monster like the hydra if you cut off one head , two more grow back
as a companion to my last post , i want to say something about an argument made by my friend pascalemmanuel gobry , like me \( if i may so label him \) a conservative catholic with some heterodox tendencies , in defense of divorceandremarried catholics taking communion , because i think it gets at a distinction that s important to my own understanding of catholic doctrine and practice here \( i ll be quoting at length \) he s discussing how advocates of communion might deal with the fact that the remarried , if their marriages aren t annulled , are living in what the church considers a persistent state of public adultery , which they don t intend to leave the juridical gordian knot here is the necessary firm resolve not to commit the sin again but it is not licentious to note that for all of us this firm resolve will be imperfect if we search our hearts , do we not find that firm resolve is drawn in shades of gray , rather than black or white \? let s take an example let s suppose that you are discerning with increasing clarity that god wants you to give up your prestigious and highly remunerative job and do something decidedly unprestigious and unremunerative if not canonically , then spiritually , you will be in a situation similar to that of the divorcedremarriedunchaste person your state of life is contrary to god s plan for you if you are in that position and anyone who s seriously struggled with sin will recognize it your will will be divided you will struggle , you will oscillate you will stumble in the shadows is this not a place where the church should want you to receive the sacraments , which are surely efficacious as means of grace \? is this not a place where it would be wisdom and truth to relativize , ever so slightly , a notion such as a firm resolve not to sin \? in my own prayer and spiritual life , i recognize this often i recognize god s call to do something , and my first response is i want to do your will , lord but if i search myself , i realize that i do not really want to do it part of me wants to , but another often stronger part does not i say i want to do it , but if i am honest with myself , i realize i do not really want it , otherwise i would already have done it a grace i often pray for is god , make me want to do your will , and if not , make me want to want it , and if not , make me want to want to want it i think this is a grace we often overlook god s law is as hard as his mercy is infinite and none of us are righteous under the law and none of us , if we are honest , can even be said to want to be righteous under the law , in every single dimension of our life but , particularly in these delicate and demanding aspects of sexual life and life situations , the grace of wanting to want god s will is already very precious and important and is it not in those phases , where we are broken down , and all we can muster the strength to pray for is to want to want , or even to want to want to want , that the church should be most present with the succor of her sacraments \? if i am a divorcedremarriedunchaste person and , during the eucharistic liturgy , i cry out in my heart , o lord ! i do not understand your law , and i do not have the will to follow it , but i love you , and i beg you for forgiveness of my sins and the grace to want to want to follow in your footsteps and to be able to humbly receive your body , is this a contrition that is sufficient for me to be able to receive the body of christ \? i think so i think there are two possible rejoinders to this argument the first , what you might call the canon lawyer s response , is that this just isn t moral and sacramental theology as the church has traditionally taught it whatever the complexities and shadesofgray involved in human sin , it is very clear in catholic teaching that the medicinal effect , the succor of communion , is inseparable \( like a twodose drug \) from the succor of a good confession , and you simply can t make a good confession , and thus be in a position to benefit spiritually from communion , if you don t intend to take some positive step to separate yourself from a gravely sinful situation or arrangement to use a higherstakes version of the professional case gobry references if you work at a job that by its nature requires grave sin for full participation \( let s say , i dunno , you re a lieutenant for the wolf of wall street in his salad days \) , and you make a confession of sin but have no plan of any kind to disassociate yourself from the business , your confession is by definition insufficient , and saying i do not have the will to stop defrauding people , lord , but i pray to gain it is a sign that you should be praying and not communing the same logic , then , would apply to someone in an institutional arrangement that amounts to public adultery under the church s definitions you need not have the full desire to change \( of course everything is grayer than a term like perfect contrition might suggest \) , but the desire to have the desire is not enough you need to have some intention to change your life , some idea of alteration , to confess and commune in good conscience and absent a significant shift in our understanding of the confessioncommunion relationship , the church s assumption has to be that people who are literally married to their sin do not but with that the church s assumption , the second possible answer enters in , which is that there might well be situations in which someone who feels unable to leave what the church considers an objectively sinful way of life can and should take communion , but that the institutional church is not competent to adjudicate , through formal procedures , who might fall into that category that is to say , the church by its nature has to work through rules and out of its deposit of revelation reason tradition , and if there are exceptions to those rules and places where the church s knowledge does not reach , then by their nature they have to be discerned by individual sinners \( and individual pastors , individual confessors and spiritual directors \) so if you find yourself where gobry s post imagines someone , feeling with certainty that you should take communion even though your state and situation officially forbids it , that decision has to be taken upon your conscience you have to risk the sin , you might say , and trust in god s mercy if you re wrong about what you should do , rather than asking that church for assurances that you aren t sinning , which \( without betraying scripture and tradition \) it simply cannot give this is where my latitudinarian side comes in i believe , like gobry , in the primacy of conscience , and if i were a pastor \( perish the thought ! \) i would be very hesitant about withholding communion , and always attuned the possibility that people who seem objectively in mortal sin are actually right with god because of reasons and circumstances that no church tribunal or doctrinal formulation could necessarily recognize or distill \( and i don t actually have to reach for the pastoral hypothetical , since there are situations in my own life that resemble the script that gobry writes above for myself , and for other people close to me \) indeed , while it can easily be carried too far see the soviet scenario i wrote about in my sunday column i think the universality of catholicism depends , to some extent , on this kind of latitudinarianism on a willingness to uphold rules and then accept to be flouted , to tolerate some distinctioninpractice between the legal and the pastoral , and to allow individuals wide , well , latitude in how they participate in catholic life \( see , for instance , the entire experience of catholic culture in the mediterranean world \) but asking the church to create a set of rules for the exceptions , which by definition depend on interior situations known to god alone , risks either doctrinal incoherence or else \( as has happened in certain religious bodies , i would submit , these last few generations \) the swift conquest of the rules by the exceptions which is why , even setting aside the particular issues related to papal infallibility and doctrinal continuity , it seems to me far better to let the two exist together the ideal and the difficult reality , the rule and consciencedriven departures from its dictates than to either attempt an impossible level of altarrail enforcement or to attempt \( as current proposals would seem to attempt \) to create a system for the unsystemizable , a formal mechanism in an area where the church s competence doesn t reach this not just a catholicspecific point as i ve written before , the idea that modern religious believers might sometimes have to end up living with cognitive dissonance in areas where their lives don t conform fully to their tradition is not necessarily a bug in the religious system it could just as easily be a feature , a spur to selfexamination and spiritual growth , and it might be one of the mild derangements of modernity that these tensions are so often assumed to be something that religious bodies should just bulldoze , in the name of mercy or unity or whatever , out of the individual believer s way for catholics specifically , meanwhile , the idea that there are many things the church doesn t know and can t know about the individual sinner s relationship to god , and about a lot of things besides is not only perfectly orthodox , it s necessary to orthodoxy but in its moral theology , the church still has to work off what it believes it does know , and what it believes it has been given sacrament , scripture , reason , tradition adulterers will go into the kingdom of god ahead of the seeminglyupright , flagrant sinners of all sorts ahead of outwardlyvirtuous whitened sepulchres , and perhaps we even can dare to hope that all men are ultimately save d but how exactly that happens is for god to know , and until we no longer see through a glass darkly it seems like the responsibility for departures from the very plain words of jesus should fallen on the conscience of the individual , and not the conscience of the church
baltimore the and the , two teams with proud postseason legacies dating back decades , had never faced each other in a playoff game until thursday they have 17 american league pennants between them \( 11 for detroit \) , seven world series titles \( four for the tigers \) and numerous other playoff appearances , but none of those had come against the other a notable hole in the fabric of postseason baseball after witnessing the opening game of the teams' american league division series , it seems fair to say that the baseball world has not been missing much although the tigers hit three home runs to the orioles' two , detroit failed to execute plays when it mattered most and baltimore took advantage , scoring eight runs in the eighth inning to turn a competitive game into a rout at camden yards nelson cruz , who hit 40 home runs in his first year with the orioles , swatted a tworun homer in the first inning to start the power surge , and later hit a runscoring single off joba chamberlain as the orioles pulled away in the eighth , thanks in part to a fielding error by andrew romine , the detroit shortstop the orioles rapped out a dozen hits and went 6 for 11 with runners in scoring position as they chased the tigers' starter , max scherzer , out of the game in the eighth , then punished the detroit bullpen for seven more runs our style is n't conventional , said adam jones , the orioles' center fielder we hack , and sometimes we look like we have no idea what we 're doing at the plate but at some point in time it clicks the clicking point thursday came in the eighth the orioles sent twelve men to the plate , only two of whom faced scherzer , and recorded six hits , including two doubles by alejandro de aza with one out , de aza doubled to right , and chamberlain replaced scherzer jones hit a playable ball to the left of romine , who mishandled it , and deaza scored romine chased the ball down in shallow left field and fired it home , too late to get the runner , then bent over in frustration from there it got worse for the tigers , especially when rajai davis committed another error it s a team effort , tigers manager brad ausmus said in baseball , a team effort is , if someone makes an error , you hope the pitcher picks them up if a pitcher struggles , you hope the lineup picks him up tonight , we did n't get it done up until that point in the game , it was a pretty good game cruz s home run in the first was his 15th in 35 postseason games , 14 of those homers coming when he was with the texas rangers the tigers responded in the top of the second inning against baltimore s starting pitcher , chris tillman , as victor martinez led off with a home run to right field , followed by another homer from j d martinez j j hardy , the orioles' shortstop , powered a changeup from scherzer over the wall in center field to lead off the bottom of the seventh and give the orioles an insurance run that seemed important miguel cabrera answered with a basesempty drive to right field off darren o 'day with two outs in the eighth to pull detroit within a run tillman retired 11 in a row after surrendering the two home runs in the second inning but his pitch count grew high as the game went along he needed 105 pitches to get through five innings , signaling the end of his night much of that workload was because of ian kinsler , the tigers' leadoff batter , who saw 30 pitches in his first three atbats , including 14 in his thirdinning plate appearance kinsler proved even more troublesome in the eighth , when he got a leadoff infield hit against o 'day but he tried to steal second base with torii hunter at the plate , and hunter lined out to hardy , who threw to first base to complete the double play ian was on his own there , ausmus said it would n't be a hitandrun in that situation game 2 is scheduled for 12 07 pm on friday , a quick turnaround for a playoff series , and detroit s justin verlander will pitch against weiyin chen during his pregame news conference thursday afternoon , orioles manager buck showalter asked a moderator why the game was set so early , and he was told it had to do with the markets four games are scheduled friday , two in the eastern time zone and two in the west what about our market \? showalter asked he was concerned that the fans in baltimore might be unable to get to a noon game and provide the kind of electric atmosphere that energized camden yards on thursday the fans , most of them wearing orange shirts , were also given small orange towels when they waved them , the ballpark was saturated in an oriolethemed monochrome i do n't care how much you do this , showalter said after the game you do feed off that that was pretty special fun to watch i felt like i wish i had a towel
portauprince , haiti merry christmas ! yet in this season of hope and holiday cheer , haiti might not seem the obvious place to celebrate almost five years after , this country symbolizes poverty and hopelessness to many americans that despair and disdain are misguided haitian politics are still a mess and poverty is deeprooted , but , more children are going to school and health is improving that , in turn , is emblematic of a broader truth that we journalists do n't acknowledge often enough in many ways , the world is becoming a better place there ! i said it bad news is news , and good news is n't we cover planes that crash , not those that take off but a relentless focus on bad news unfortunately leads people to conclude that places from haiti to congo are hopeless , driving away tourists , investors and donors so , at least once a year , it s worth stepping back and acknowledging progress that s particularly true because 2015 will be a crucial year for efforts to combat global poverty there will be that is saving lives on a huge scale , the african union plans to focus on women s empowerment , and the united nations general assembly in september is expected to agree on new that will provide metrics for progress for many years to come so bear this in mind than at any time in recorded history , and more children are in school here in haiti , too many people are still homeless from the earthquake but , in the last few years , the economy has been growing more quickly than the american economy an americanbacked effort in haiti has fizzled but agriculture , which may be the best hope for haiti s economic future , is improving in some important sectors i visited a program that trains flower farmers to use greenhouses and is supported by the united states as part of the one farmer , , told me that , with greenhouses , he has tripled production of chrysanthemums you come back and this hillside will be covered with greenhouses , he predicted he added that the flowers i buy for my wife in new york will eventually be exported from haiti health care likewise shows basic improvements more than four out of five haitian children get some childhood immunizations deworming is now widespread in the old days , these kids would be dead , dr margareth mallet told me as she showed me around a ward treating severely malnourished children at a clinic here in the capital , portauprince now they 're revived with a peanutbased paste or other supplements there has also been a push to encourage haitian moms to breastfeed , because that s regarded by nutrition experts as \( globally , an estimated 800 , 000 children die annually because of problems with breastfeeding \) in 1970 , almost a quarter of haitian children died before their 5th birthday at last count , the figure is 7 percent just compared with 15 years ago , one fewer child dies each hour as families grow confident that their children will survive , they also have fewer of them in 2005 , the average woman in haiti could be expected to have five children is about three births per woman none of this is to gloss over the remaining challenges at least two billion people are malnourished worldwide , in washington is n't this season supposed to be about something more profound than shopping and christmas trees \? so i 'd suggest that the successes against poverty should stimulate us to do more and some steps are remarkably simple consider  when a pregnant woman does n't get enough iodine , her baby s brain does n't develop properly iodize the salt and , years later , children will do better in school and will have higher iq s another nutritional triumph that on your plate it s the mother teresa of foods , a treasure of vitamin a in particular it could prevent blindness or death for millions of children suffering from vitamin a deficiency , so aid groups like grow it in poor countries good for michelle obama this year to encourage their use worldwide the orange sweet potato is gaining ground , and hunger and sickness are retreating so tuck into your meal join the holiday cheer the world still has its problems , but as an incentive to do more , let s acknowledge some reasons for joy
washington he went off to fight , telling a cousin that i may never return but i will gain a name in this war first lt alonzo h cushing proved right on both counts he did not return , and now , after an epic delay notable even in a town famed for taking its time , his name will at long last be honored at the white house more than 150 years after standing his ground against , lieutenant cushing will be awarded the medal of honor by president obama a result both of his heroism in those dark days and of the persistence of a 94yearold wisconsin woman who lobbied on his behalf for more than a quartercentury lieutenant cushing was at the center of the most pivotal day of arguably the most pivotal battle of the civil war an artillery commander at age 22 , he refused to retreat in the face of the confederate infantry assault ordered by gen robert e lee on cemetery ridge and kept firing his cannon even after being wounded after all the blood spilled during the charge , named for maj gen george pickett , the union had repelled the southern rebels , who never fully recovered for the remainder of the war this falls into that category of it s never too late to do the right thing , said representative ron kind , democrat of wisconsin , who cosponsored legislation that allowed lieutenant cushing to receive the medal so long after the war many military historians for years scratched their heads wondering how he was overlooked for the medal of honor at the time coming around full circle 150 years after the fact is the right thing to do nearly half of the previous 3 , 490 recipients of the medal of honor fought in the civil war , but none waited as long as lieutenant cushing the approval of the medal by the first black president adds a certain historical coda to the saga , underscoring how much has changed in this country since lieutenant cushing gave his life in a war that ended slavery in the united states the long delay owes to a variety of factors that speak to how washington works , or does not at the time of lieutenant cushing s death , the medal was not awarded posthumously , so he was ineligible once the rules changed and his cause was taken up , it lingered for years in the bureaucratic and legislative trenches of the capital , where some worried that honoring him would open the floodgates to other requests mr kind said some southern colleagues were also less than enthusiastic there was some resistance to awarding a union soldier the congressional medal at gettysburg even 150 years after the fact , mr kind said they did n't want us refighting the civil war all over again it s still sensitive but we were finally able to bridge that gulf and get it done the nation s leadership has lately been revisiting veterans of other conflicts who were not decorated this past spring , mr obama awarded the medal of honor to 24 veterans from world war ii , korea and vietnam who had been overlooked , most because of their racial or ethnic backgrounds the white house announced tuesday that mr obama would likewise honor two more vietnam veterans on sept 15 but civil war veterans come up less frequently , for obvious reasons the last one awarded the medal of honor was a former slave who fought in south carolina for the union and was honored by president bill clinton shortly before he left office in 2001 the latest case was pressed most passionately by margaret zerwekh , the granddaughter of a union veteran whose house sits on land once owned by lieutenant cushing s father in delafield , wis a history buff who named her pet goose pepin , after charlemagne s son , ms zerwekh became intrigued by the story of lieutenant cushing , who died childless although he is honored by a plaque at gettysburg , she decided to wage a onewoman campaign for the nation s highest recognition mom loves to do research , said sally weber , ms zerwekh s daughter ms zerwekh started by writing to senator william proxmire , democrat of wisconsin , for whom mr kind worked at the time mr proxmire has since died , but mr kind inherited the effort when he won election to the house other wisconsin politicians joined as well , including representative jim sensenbrenner , a republican , and former senator russ feingold , a democrat john m mchugh , the secretary of the army , expressed support in 2010 but the effort still required an act of congress reached by telephone at her home in wisconsin on wednesday , ms zerwekh gave a concise answer to why she cared so much about lieutenant cushing he saved the union , she said lieutenant cushing graduated from the united states military academy at west point and had spent two years fighting for the union by the time general lee drove his army into the north toward gettysburg on july 3 , 1863 , the third and final day of the battle , lieutenant cushing commanded an artillery battery with 125 men trying to stave off a charge of virginians and other confederates lieutenant cushing was wounded by shrapnel in the right shoulder and groin and urged to get off the battlefield , but he refused i 'll stay and fight it out , or die in the attempt , he was reported saying he moved his cannon to a wall and kept firing another soldier , first sgt frederick fuger , held him upright as he gave commands with confederates just 300 to 400 yards away , lieutenant cushing was shot in the mouth and finally fell he died at a particularly momentous event in a very momentous battle , the largest land engagement of the war , and he died in one of the most critical , if not the most critical spot on the field , said kent masterson brown , a civil war historian who wrote a biography of the soldier called cushing of gettysburg mr brown became gripped by the lieutenant s story as a boy when his family visited gettysburg in 1964 , and he eventually published his book in 1993 he is so representative of a people who had that sort of fortitude , who sacrificed that much , he said , adding that the medal would recognize that in that sense , it s a wonderful thing to behold
when the coach of the spanish women s golf team , marta figuerasdotti , was asked to serve as a captain s assistant for the european solheim cup team last year , it marked a turning point this was n't just a personal accolade for the spanish coach it was a statement about the strength of her national program three of the 12 europeans on that 2013 solheim cup team , which beat the united states in colorado to retain the cup , were from spain honestly , i am less and less surprised every day , figuerasdotti said of the recent success of female spanish golfers and when asked about the chance that a spanish woman would win a major title for the first time this week at the evian championship in france , she singled out several players who seem poised to peak at the right time azahara mu oz , carlota ciganda and bel n mozo i think azahara has a chance to win because her mind is so strong and she has been right up there every week , figuerasdotti said carlota has the passion and drive to win soon , and she loves that course and mozo , who has two top10 finishes this year , has refocused on her mental approach , she said of figuerasdotti s three solheim cup players , mu oz has posted eight top10 finishes this year and is hoping to add a second career victory ciganda , in her second full lpga season , recorded her careerbest tie for 13th in a major last month at the wegmans lpga championship and beatriz recari , who has three victories and 19 top10 lpga finishes , seems poised for a breakthrough tournament this year in the current world rankings for professionals , france and spain lead europe , each with three players in the top 100 mu oz is the topranked spaniard , at no12 , followed by no42 recari and ciganda at no63 in the world amateur rankings , seven spanish women are in the top 100 , with three in the top 20 , the most for a european nation but those numbers did not fall into place serendipitously figuerasdotti , 56 , lobbied for change within the spanish golf federation after she retired from the lpga tour in 2001 and became coach of the national women s team as the first spanish player to play on the lpga tour and the tour s first winner from spain , figuerasdotti had experienced top competition in golf but when she pointed to the path she had taken , others did n't view it as the one spain s top young talent should follow when i returned to spain after playing on tour , i was told not to talk to the amateurs about my experiences in the united states , figuerasdotti recalled they were afraid the players would leave europe to play college golf in the states and that we would n't have good representatives for our tournaments in europe the new coach argued that spanish players would never become globally respected if they competed only in europe she asked the spanish golf federation to think on a larger scale i knew our players would be known if they played or won on the lpga tour or if they played in the solheim cup , she said it was a struggle until i helped the federation see that and believe it soon , spaniards began heading to the united states to play college golf while pursuing their education it did n't take long for some of spain s top amateurs to have an impact on the best college programs in america mu oz was the 2008 individual champion while at arizona state , and mozo helped her university of southern california team win the 2008 ncaa team championship the next year , mu oz and ciganda helped arizona state win the 2009 ncaa team championship , and the same year their compatriot mar a hern ndez won the individual national title playing for purdue university in 2011 , another spaniard , marta silva , starred at the university of georgia and was voted player of the year by the national golf coaches association but hern ndez had to be convinced to try college golf figuerasdotti , who graduated from the university of southern california in 1982 with a degree in humanities and social sciences , encouraged hern ndez to use the collegiate environment to improve her skills for me , she has meant everything , and without marta , none of us would be where we are today , said hern ndez , who earned lpga membership in 2010 mu oz said the coach s experience as a player was extremely valuable to the national team and that she shared her insight with players to help them grow everything i have done since i was little has made me a better golfer and prepared me for the lpga , mu oz said referring to the fact that figuerasdotti was the first spanish player to win on the lpga , recari added , it s a true honor and privilege to be on that list after her tania el segui , a spaniard who plays on the ladies european tour , was also encouraged by figuerasdotti to dream big el segui turned pro in 2005 , qualified for the 2009 lpga tour and was selected for the 2009 european solheim cup team she was a very big influence on me and was my coach for almost 10 years , el segui said figuerasdotti will continue molding her young spanish amateurs and encouraging her pros , but her next focus is to send a competitive spanish team to rio for the  she was recently awarded a medal by the national sports council of spain and was given an honorary life membership at royal birkdale golf club in southport , england , for her victory in the women s british open there in 1982 the honors have been meaningful , she said , but not as much as seeing her players excel on a personal level , i'm very proud of the work i'm doing , and they 've made me grow as a coach , she said i may be a better coach than i was a player and her players have learned that their coach still expects big things from them whether they are winning college tournaments , lpga championships , climbing the world rankings or regularly reminding the world that spanish golf is now a global contender
it is with the benefit of hindsight that sept 7 now stands out as a rare and amazing day for that was the sunday when , in their season opener , actually won a game they have not won since not in eight games , played in five stadiums and in two time zones their misery is in its third month , with no relief in sight during this long , pathetic stretch , in which , among other things , the jets have allowed 22 touchdown receptions and intercepted one pass in return , some crazy things have happened in the nfl the cleveland browns rallied from a 25point deficit against the titans in tennessee , and quarterback mark sanchez , the famous jets reject , got back on the field again and led the philadelphia eagles to , you guessed it , a victory then there was ben roethlisberger of the pittsburgh steelers , who on sunday threw six touchdown passes for the second consecutive game guess whom the jets play next \? we could go on , and on , but here is a random sample of some of the other things that have happened since the jets last came out on top the mets won 11 games \( as did the yankees , for that matter \) the winnipeg jets won two games in the new york metropolitan area , against the islanders and the rangers joan jett was nominated to the rock and roll hall of fame an nfl coach was fired dennis allen , whose oakland raiders naturally supplied the jets with their only victory the brooklyn bolts , of the new fall experimental football league , have won all three of their games the chinese ecommerce giant alibaba debuted on the stock market and , as of monday , was worth more than walmart pacific12 teams completed three hail marys four new network television shows manhattan love story \( abc \) , bad judge and a to z \( nbc \) and utopia \( fox \) none had anything to do with the jets as far as we know the university of florida football team , for which the jets offensive coordinator marty mornhinweg s son , skyler , is a backup quarterback , won three games geno smith , the jets quarterback who has cursed at a fan , missed a team meeting and lost his starting job , turned a year older his 24th birthday was on oct 10 , two days before the jets lost to denver
imider , morocco on a hilltop nearly 5 , 000 feet high in the atlas mountains here , a tiny outpost has taken shape over the past two years the small stone buildings are decorated gaily with graffiti , and there is an openair gallery many doors bear inspirational inscriptions from people like the rev dr martin luther king jr and mother teresa on the dam of a nearby reservoir , someone has painted the face of a local activist , now in jail on what the locals regard as trumpedup charges it is an unlikely spot for a settlement , but it was established with a purpose to protest a mining company s expropriation of precious water supplies , as well as the pollution that results from the mining the inhabitants are drawn from the nearby municipality of imider , 6 , 000 people scattered over seven villages and neighbor to the most productive silver mine in africa but while the area may be rich in silver , it is home to some of the poorest people in morocco the people of imider \( pronounced eemeder \) say they have grown to resent the mine because they get nothing from it except pollutants so two years ago , some of them climbed up the hill and cut the water supply to the mine since then , they have occupied the hill as they continue to fight the imiter mettalurgic company and , by extension , the king of morocco , its principal owner we were ready to talk , said brahim udawd , 30 , one of the leaders of the protest movement , referring to the events that led to the occupation of the hilltop but nobody paid attention to us , so we closed the water valve they take the silver and leave us the waste these days , the hilltop , mount alebban , is relatively calm women come daily to cook in the little stone houses and participate in the regular strategy meetings that the villagers hold we have been here for two and a half years , and nobody is hearing our cry for help , said mina ouzzine , 40 i voted yes for a new constitution because i hoped there will be change , more equality we are only equal in poverty in 2011 , when the arab revolutions led to the fall of dictators in egypt and tunisia , the moroccan king , mohammed vi , managed to stall the protests by offering constitutional overhauls that guaranteed more power to an elected government and more freedoms to moroccans but none of that has helped the people here while for some , the conflict of imider is mostly ideological , others say that it is not just about ordinary people rising up to make their lives better but also part of a larger problem that is echoed in conflicts with big mining companies across the globe the occupation of the hill was set off in the summer of 2011 after students who were used to getting seasonal jobs were turned down that led the other villagers even those with jobs to show solidarity and move to block the mine s production abilities one of the main demands of the villagers is that 75 percent of the jobs at the mine be allocated to their municipality the bigger the mine , the more capital intensive the industry and the fewer the jobs , said gavin hilson , who specializes in mining and development at the university of surrey business school even if the policy in place is to create jobs , there are only so many jobs it can create exactly what is happening with the water is in dispute the villagers say they want the company held responsible for environmental damage that they say is the cause of disease , livestock fatalities and desertification in the 1990s , i used to have trees , fruits , oil , almonds , said bou tahar , 70 , a farmer but they died after the mine began taking the water , he said , adding , since we cut the flow in 2011 , our wells are starting to fill up again according to mr hilson , these kinds of disputes are not uncommon if you 're operating in a place like that with quite a few people living in the community , it would be suicidal to exhaust the place from its water supply or to reach a point where villagers become agitated over the consumption of water , he said it is always challenging to operate in dry environments there are issues with water , with waste disposal and community development because it all revolves around water the company categorically denies the townspeople s accusations and says that an environmental impact study has proved that it is not contaminating the water supply or harming the environment the company says that the mining was certified as meeting global environmental standards and that it has put in place irrigation systems for the farmers we are very careful , and we do n't pollute the water or the land around the mine , said farid hamdaoui , a manager at the mine we recycle 62 percent of the water we use , and we have authorization from the state to pump the water we use company officials say their processing capacity dropped 40 percent in 2012 and 30 percent in 2013 , after the villagers cut off one source of their water these days , they use another source in an effort to make up the loss mr hamdaoui said that despite having the king as the main shareholder , the company did not gain any special treatment from the government he said the company was spending more than 1 million a year to build schools and to support community projects we do n't substitute for the state , but we work with the state in a proactive social program , he said the mine cannot unfortunately solve all the problems of unemployment in the region still , the activists who refer to themselves as the movement on the way of 96 , a reference to a similar upheaval in 1996 that was crushed by the authorities , maintain that the company is in fact receiving favorable treatment from the state the governor and other elected officials declined to comment on the dispute , which settled into a stalemate after negotiations broke down in november after each meeting held at the foot of the hill , the villagers walk back home holding up three fingers one for the berber language , one for the land and one for mankind hoping for someone to hear their call the king forgot about us he tours the country helping people , and he never comes to this region , said one woman he is our father , and he has forgotten about his children
as anyone i 've talked with during the past week knows , i have been obsessed with trying to get my mind around the to uphold michigan s voterapproved ban on affirmative action in admissions to the state s public universities i 've puzzled over whether the court managed in its five separate opinions none commanding more than three votes to accomplish anything beyond demonstrating its persistent incoherence in the face of the questions of whether , how , and for what purposes the government may take account of race justice anthony m kennedy s plurality opinion \( joined by chief justice john g roberts jr and justice samuel a alito jr \) denied that the case in fact presented any such profound questions this case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved , he insisted it is about who may resolve it the opinion s answer the voters , not the courts yet only seven years ago , in the , the first major decision of the roberts court , these same three justices voted to invalidate exceedingly modest racially conscious student assignment plans adopted by the elected school boards of louisville , ky , and seattle the democratically arrivedat judgment of those communities was to take those steps to preserve their schools' hardwon gains of integration in the face of housing patterns that threatened resegregation the court s answer back then \( overturning the lower courts , which had upheld the school boards' plans \) to the question of who may resolve it the supreme court and not the voters oh , well something deep was clearly at stake in last week s decision , schuette v bamn but the question i 've been struggling with is whether something deep actually happened the answer , i 've finally decided , is it depends of course , the significance of any supreme court decision always depends to some degree on outside factors the impact on the ground , how the lower courts interpret and apply the ruling in subsequent cases that s actually not what i mean this time what i mean is that any appraisal of the michigan decision s significance depends on whether you look at it from close range as under a microscope or whether you step far enough back to see the decision in the larger context of its place in the firmament , as through a telescope from close up , which is how i first read it , the decision was not a huge deal it was certainly no surprise this case had been an accident waiting to happen , if not from the minute the lawsuit was filed challenging the amendment , which michigan voters approved by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent \( shortened to bamn , the plaintiff organization s full name is coalition to defend affirmative action , integration and immigration rights and fight for equality not a name destined to warm the hearts of the conservative justices \) , then from the appeals court decision in november 2012 that declared the amendment unconstitutional the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit , currently perhaps the most polarized of all federal appellate circuits , divided 8 to 7 in striking down the amendment seven of the eight judges in the majority were appointed by democratic presidents and all seven of those in dissent were appointed by republicans the majority held that while michigan was free to abandon affirmative action as a matter of policy , the addition of an antiaffirmative action amendment to the state constitution restructured the state s political process in a way that violated the 14th amendment s guarantee of equal protection there was no way the conservative supreme court justices were going to let that narrow majority of appellate judges have the last word although the case was about the validity of the political process that enabled michigan voters to shut down affirmative action , and not as justice kennedy emphasized about affirmative action itself , it seemed unlikely that affirmative action would emerge unscathed yet it did , pretty much justice kennedy noted that consideration of race in university admissions remained permissible , provided that certain conditions are met granted , this was simply a statement of current law , rather than an endorsement of it which is what enabled chief justice roberts and justice alito to sign the opinion along with justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas , who jointly filed a separate and more sweeping concurring opinion , they would change the law in the blink of an eye to prohibit affirmative action if they could persuade justice kennedy to go along maybe the strongest indication that the decision stopped short of a direct hit on affirmative action is the fact that justice stephen g breyer , in a separate opinion , concurred in the judgment justice breyer had dissented famously and passionately from the parents involved decision seven years ago having argued then that the court should defer to the local school boards' decision to consider race in student assignments the constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers , he said in his 2007 dissent he framed the latest issue in similar judicially modest terms the constitution allows local , state , and national communities to adopt narrowly tailored raceconscious programs designed to bring about greater inclusion and diversity , he wrote last week but the constitution foresees the ballot box , not the courts , as the normal instrument for resolving differences and debates about the merits of these programs to the plaintiffs' argument that by subjecting affirmative action to a voter referendum , michigan had restructured the political process in a way that earlier supreme court decisions would not have permitted , justice breyer had an answer unelected faculty members and administrators , not voters or their elected representatives , adopted the raceconscious admissions programs affected by michigan s constitutional amendment , he wrote the amendment took decisionmaking authority away from these unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters the court s precedents that prohibited voters from undoing the civil rights protections conferred by legislatures thus did n't apply justice breyer said , because in this case , there is no prior electoral process in which the minority participated in describing the facts this way , justice breyer reduced the michigan case to a oneoff , a case not implicating the political process precedents that are so clearly out of favor with the court s majority in this analysis , the decision therefore posed no threat , either to those precedents or to the project , to which justice breyer subscribes , of trying to preserve some room for affirmative action he had the michigan case under a microscope it remained to justice sonia sotomayor to step back and widen the field of view to encompass not just this decision but the entire recent trajectory of the supreme court s treatment of race race matters , she wrote it matters in part because of the long history of racial minorities' being denied access to the political process it matters because of persistent racial inequality in society she said the court s refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable justice sotomayor , whose 58page opinion was also signed by justice ruth bader ginsburg , said the decision eviscerates an important strand of our equal protection jurisprudence she added for members of historically marginalized groups , which rely on the federal courts to protect their constitutional rights , the decision can hardly bolster hope for a vision of democracy that preserves for all the right to participate meaningfully and equally in selfgovernment it was the intensely personal quality of passages in justice sotomayor s opinion that captured public attention and put people on notice that something beyond a technocratic massaging of the court s precedents had occurred race matters to a young woman s sense of self when she states her hometown , and then is pressed , 'no , where are you from \? ' regardless of how many generations her family has been in the country race matters to a young person addressed by a stranger in a foreign language , which he does not understand because only english was spoken at home race matters because of the slights , the snickers , the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts i do not belong here' i can recall only one other personal narrative of this nature in a supreme court opinion it came in a dissenting opinion in another michigan case , , the 2003 decision that upheld the affirmative action program at the university of michigan s law school \( and that three years later prompted the state s voter referendum that effectively overturned it \) the author was justice thomas , who wrote an amazing 31page opinion in which he called affirmative action a cruel farce that did little more than stigmatize its beneficiaries a group in which he unmistakably intended to include himself i was n't in the courtroom to hear justice sotomayor announce her dissent from the bench it was the first time in five terms that she took this step to underscore the depth of her disagreement reading her opinion , i pondered the question of whom she envisioned as her audience it was n't , i assume , her colleagues , who except for justice ginsburg \( justice elena kagan did n't participate in the case \) had shown themselves beyond persuasion during the more than six months that the court had the case under consideration rather , justice sotomayor s intended audience was the rest of us she summoned us to look through a telescope at the steady erasure of a kind of constitutional discourse that once prevailed at the supreme court , predicated on the assumption that claims to racial justice on behalf of what the court once called discrete and insular minorities merited the justices' special solicitude justice scalia , in his separate concurring opinion , took direct aim at that notion and mocked it at the start of her opinion , justice sotomayor referred to this case as the last chapter of discrimination , one that presented not an overt or subtle denial of the actual right to vote , but rather a change in the ground rules of the process so as to make it more difficult for the minority , and the minority alone , to obtain policies designed to foster racial integration although i remain uncertain at the end of the day of what the michigan decision means , i strongly suspect that it s not the last chapter only the latest
government leaders from across the world will gather at the united nations in new york on tuesday for a summit meeting on global warming , and china is at the heart of contentious negotiations on how to cut the greenhouse gas emissions behind that warming in 2009 , governments agreed on a goal of keeping greenhouse gases below a level that would cause global average temperatures to rise two degrees celsius \( 36 degrees fahrenheit \) above the preindustrial average but none of the major economies is on track to make the emissions cuts needed to achieve that goal an international research effort , the global carbon project , has been tracking emissions trends and the latest findings , published on sunday in the project s annual global carbon budget , showed that in 2013 china emitted 28 percent of all greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and other human activities in an interview , glen peters , a senior research fellow at the center for international climate and environmental research oslo and a scientist with the global carbon project , discussed why china poses such a big challenge for curbing global warming in the latest global carbon budget , china seems to figure even more prominently than ever why is that \? after all , it s not the only country emitting carbon dioxide many wealthy countries have higher average emissions per person china has undergone unprecedented economic and structural changes in the last decades , and this is also true for carbon dioxide emissions in 2002 , china emitted around 14 percent of global emissions and the international energy agency wrote that in 2030 chinese emissions would remain well below those of the united states since then , chinese emissions have grown at around 8 percent per year , passing the united states in emissions in 2006 china now emits 28 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions , more than the united states and european union combined , and almost double the emissions of the united states alone china has percapita emissions 45 percent over the global average , and higher percapita emissions than the european union sixty percent of the growth in global emissions since 2002 is due to china even though china has emitted less in total than the united states and european union since preindustrial times , the gap is fast closing the major changes are all happening in china , and the world s eyes are therefore on china china emits a lot of carbon , but it s a big country that also makes a lot for the rest of the world how much of china s emissions are the byproduct of those exports , and what lessons should we draw from that \? around 20 to 30 percent of chinese emissions are to produce products that are exported and consumed outside of china in some years , the production of exports has accounted for over half of the growth in chinese emissions chinese negotiators have mentioned this rhetorically to media , but never formally in negotiations exports have been important for economic growth in china , and suggesting that the exported emissions are the responsibility of other countries is an invitation for those countries to regulate the exported emissions the prospect of placing a border carbon adjustment on the carbon content of chinese exports has been raised by many trading partners , notably the united states in contrast , despite the carbon intensity of the chinese economy , many chinese exports could be seen as a benefit for climate china has a production capacity that no other country can rival , and thus china has the ability to drive down the costs of solar , wind and other renewable technologies in this case , chinese exports may have a climate benefit more focus is needed on leveraging chinese production in a beneficial way for the climate china s carbon emissions growth has recently slowed , and there has been a significant falloff in coal demand but your research seems to caution against assuming that there s been a permanent slowing in emissions growth from china is that right and why \? one needs to be careful with annual changes in emissions the 5 percent rebound in global carbon dioxide emissions after the global financial crisis is one good example chinese emissions grew at 42 percent in 2013 , one of the lowest rates since 2002 this is due in part to lower economic growth than the average over the previous decade and to a faster than expected improvement in the carbon intensity of the economy , meaning that emissions growth is slower than economic growth the improvements in carbon intensity may represent the effect of chinese policies aimed at reducing emissions , such as rapid expansion in renewable technologies , energy efficiency , local pollution control , emission trading systems , to name a few nevertheless , a few more years of data are needed to confirm if this is a lasting trend or annual variability an important concept in the work of the global carbon project is committed emissions i take it what you mean is that , once you build infrastructure , such as coalpower plants , you lock yourself into longterm emissions unless you decommission or somehow redesign the infrastructure is that right , and what are the implications for a big emitter like china \? there is often focus on exported emissions from china , but the growth in exports is matched by strong growth in infrastructure investments there has been unprecedented growth in renewable technologies , but the construction of coal power plants continues almost unabated given these power plants will be in operation for 40 years or more , china has already committed to emit more in the future than it has in the past interestingly , if the remaining carbon quota to stay below two degrees celsius above preindustrial levels is shared amongst nations according to population , then china has already exceeded its share of the quota if these committed emissions are included so what does your most recent research tell you about where china s carbon emissions could be headed , and how much they ll have to bend to give the world a chance of meeting the twodegree target \? since china is responsible for almost 30 percent of current global emissions and emissions continue robust growth , to have any realistic chance of keeping below two degrees requires strong action by china we estimate that the remaining emission quota to stay below two degrees celsius requires china to reduce emissions at around 8 to 10 percent per year and this is , in many cases , greater than the mitigation challenge for the united states by comparison , the transition to nuclear energy in france , belgium and sweden in the 1980s led to reductions of 4 percent per year , but they only lasted for a decade the mitigation challenge for china is immense that sounds daunting could you explain the implications \? many chinese scientists and officials say that china s carbon emissions are likely to keep growing until at least around 2025 , and possibly many years after that but you re saying that keeping to a twodegree goal will demand much faster , deeper cuts from china , not to speak of the rest of the world is that right \? there is a broad misconception of what it means to keep below two degrees most analyses use models that have very optimistic assumptions about the implementation of carbon pricing globally and the availability of key technologies like carbon capture and storage analyses also focus on what happens at the global level , hiding countryspecific details this gives the impression that mitigation is easy once there is sufficient political and societal support the engineering reality on the ground is likely to be quite different while china is moving forward with stronger and stronger climate policies , it is unclear if china s current level of ambition is consistent with keeping global warming below two degrees the arithmetic of the small remaining emission quota means that the more china emits , the less others can emit this brings issues of equity and fairness directly into the debate despite positive progress in chinese climate policy , the reality is that , to be consistent with two degrees , a peak and decline in chinese emissions will have to occur sooner and faster you ve said that , given the failure of advanced countries to do much more in cutting emissions , china has a chance to lead the way in the climate negotiations but how could it make the kind of emissions reductions you have in mind without hurting its economy \? as you know , there s a great deal of reluctance in china to making changes that could put economic growth at risk each country has its own historical context , which often psychologically constrains options moving forward norway is among the richest nations in the world but does not see a path away from its dependence on oil and gas extraction in contrast , its immediate neighbors denmark , sweden and finland have been almost as successful , but without oil and gas there are many ways that a country can find its riches the secret for china is to make itself a part of the solution it is clear that to keep below two degrees requires massive new investments in renewable technologies , batteries , electric cars , and carbon capture and storage a bold move forward will ensure these technologies are made in china , with the riches to closely follow
paris spectators arriving early at roland garros encounter an unusual sight each morning more than 200 children singing and chanting as they run down a wide walkway that leads past the empty stadium of philippe chatrier court they are the ballos , or ball kids , heading down roland garros s equivalent of broadway their destination is suzanne lenglen court , 100 yards away like a military unit on a morning jaunt , they surge up lenglen s steps and swarm in loose ranks around its exterior twice there is nothing nonchalant about the s youngest employees david portier , 34 , their leader , said the morning singing was for the positive vibe it transmits to the people , a welcome in the stadium , a good feeling in the morning the 250 youths follow a robust ritual that began to take form more than 40 years ago , ridha bensalha , a tunisianborn tennis professional , said he created the first modern organization to train ball kids at roland garros in 1973 bensalha had a reputation for toughness hard \? i'm hard , he said the ball kids like this you know , they do it because i must be hard with them but i am not hard like the military i enjoy being with them bensalha was succeeded in 2010 by portier , his assistant , amid concerns that bensalha was too tough on his charges , which he denied today s conditioning is aimed at building physical balance , portier said you have to wake up your body on the morning , he said none of the three other major international championships devote as much attention to conditioning over the years , bensalha staged training clinics as far away as key biscayne , fla , and montreal next year , portier said , he will help advise trainers of ball kids at the australian open six chinese children qualified for this year s contingent at roland garros two italian administrators are studying with portier to prepare for next year s italian open one morning early this week , the ball kids began by stretching , running , hopping from foot to foot , skipping sideways and practicing the motion of rolling the ball we do this , said romane lecureux , 14 , of amiens , france , because it means we are warm when we go the court without their workout , said lvaro gonz lez rico , 13 , a madridborn paris resident , we might hurt our muscle as a final exercise , they lay prone together in neat rows on a sidewalk and an asphalt walkway , keeping their eyes closed for nearly five minutes just five minutes for concentration , to think about what you want before starting a very hard day , portier said bensalha s ball kids shook off their sleep and strengthened their esprit , he said , by singing , we are the ball kids we are the best in the world no , it s not like that , portier said , chuckling now , he said , they sing , we are the best of this year , ' because 3 , 000 kids want to be ball kids at the french open , and now 250 are the best of this year nevertheless , bensalha s ideas still seem at work on match courts you must understand all that the player needs in the court water , towels , he said in 2009 if federer needs this ball , you give him this ball if nadal needs this ball , you give him this ball we work very hard about this delivering balls to each court in a cloth barrel worn as a backpack , rolling balls rapidly to the server s end of the court , repeatedly running forward with towels for even the leastknown players , the ball kids embrace a tradition that roland garros calls its own
amanda curtis , a 34yearold high school math teacher , is now the democrats' us senate candidate in montana finally , a strategy for bringing down the average age of a senator , which is around 62 plus , a math teacher would come in handy elect somebody who knows how to count would be an awesome campaign ad if curtis had the money to pay for any ads , which currently does not seem all that likely i told my husband kevin , i'm really sorry i got us into this , ' she recalled in a phone interview and he said why do you have to be so blanking awesome \? ' he s very supportive i believe i speak for all americans when i say that we are totally in favor of kevin curtis as a senatorial spouse it s doubtful that we 'll be seeing any curtis in washington anytime soon but in a week of so much dreadful news from every corner of the world , let s take an opportunity to sing a happy chorus to this season s superlongshot candidates really , where would we be without them \? staring at a ballot full of preelected public officials , that s where montana democrats have been going through what you might call a rough patch first , senator max baucus announced that he was not going to run again for his seat baucus gave out the news early so he could concentrate on serving montana then president obama offered him an ambassadorship to china and baucus flatout quit john walsh , the democratic lieutenant governor , was appointed to take his place then the times s jonathan martin reported that walsh had plagiarized a lot of his final paper as a master s candidate at the army war college the senator of six months announced that he was not going to run for a full term against the wealthy congressman republicans had nominated , because he wanted to devote all his time to his fight for montana none of the wellknown democratic names in the state were interested in taking walsh s place or the somewhatknown names i was scraping and glazing and puttying my storm windows , said curtis , who was chosen last weekend by a party convention and the phone rang it was a reporter saying john walsh dropped out and they ca n't find any other politician to run' the storm windows are still leaning against my house montana has only sent one woman to congress jeannette rankin , a suffragist and pacifist who was elected in 1916 she was sworn in the same day that woodrow wilson asked congress to declare war on germany rankin voted no and was decried by a helena newspaper as a dupe of the kaiser , a member of the hun army in the united states , and a crying schoolgirl that was pretty much that rankin ran again more than two decades later and was elected just before the japanese bombed pearl harbor , giving her the opportunity to cast the only vote against entering world war ii montana is 100 percent against you , her brother wired encouragingly that was the end of her congressional career but she held up the torch , and in 1968 , at 87 , went back to washington to lead 5 , 000 demonstrators in a women s march against the war in vietnam always happy to have a chance to mention jeannette rankin , who teaches us that fighting for a losing cause most definitely does not make you a losing person amanda curtis grew up in a family rocked by divorce , alcoholism , financial struggles and violence she fought her way through college and into a teaching career her experience with students , she said , taught her that what she thought was a uniquely terrible childhood was actually not all that unusual in montana she began to get involved in community groups , and , in 2012 , she was elected to the state house of representatives once in the office , curtis began posting videos at the end of every day in the legislature in which she stood in her office or kitchen , sometimes looking perky , sometimes looking exhausted , and talked into the camera \( day 73 and wait until you hear this \) her mission was part educational , with heavy emphasis on the workings of the business and labor committee on the other hand , it was partly pure venting it was so hard to not to walk across the floor and punch him , she said , in a rant that montana republicans have already included in a mashup of video highlights their collection does not note that curtis was talking about a debate over gay rights in which another lawmaker insinuated that homosexuals lacked moral character imagine what it would be like if our senators all came home every night and posted their real thoughts when they were too tired to selfcensor maybe we should make that a requirement
lake mead , nev the sinuous colorado river and its slew of manmade reservoirs from the rockies to southern arizona are being sapped by 14 years of drought nearly unrivaled in 1 , 250 years the once broad and blue river has in many places dwindled to a murky brown trickle reservoirs have shrunk to less than half their capacities , the canyon walls around them ringed with white mineral deposits where water once lapped seeking to stretch their allotments of the river , regional water agencies are recycling sewage effluent , offering rebates to tear up grass lawns and subsidizing less thirsty appliances from dishwashers to shower heads but many experts believe the current drought is only the harbinger of a new , drier era in which the colorado s flow will be substantially and permanently diminished faced with the shortage , federal authorities this year will for the first time decrease the amount of water that flows into lake mead , the nation s largest reservoir , from lake powell 180 miles upstream that will reduce even more the level of lake mead , a crucial source of water for cities from las vegas to los angeles and for millions of acres of farmland reclamation officials say there is a 5050 chance that by 2015 , lake mead s water will be rationed to states downstream that , too , has never happened before if lake mead goes below elevation 1 , 000 1 , 000 feet above sea level we lose any capacity to pump water to serve the municipal needs of seven in 10 people in the state of nevada , said john entsminger , the senior deputy general manager of the southern nevada water authority since 2008 , mr entsminger s agency has been drilling an 817 million tunnel under lake mead a third attempt to capture more water as two higher tunnels have become threatened by the lake s falling level in september , faced with the prospect that one of the tunnels could run dry before the third one was completed , the authority took emergency measures still another tunnel , this one to stretch the life of the most threatened intake until construction of the third one is finished these new realities are forcing a profound reassessment of how the 1 , 450mile colorado , the southwest s only major river , can continue to slake the thirst of one of the nation s fastestgrowing regions agriculture , from california s imperial valley to wyoming s cattle herds , soaks up about threequarters of its water , and produces 15 percent of the nation s food but 40 million people also depend on the river and its tributaries , and their numbers are rising rapidly the labyrinthine rules by which the seven colorado states share the river s water are rife with potential points of conflict and while some states have made huge strides in conserving water and even reducing the amount they consume they have yet to chart a united path through shortages that could last years or even decades there is no planning for a continuation of the drought we 've had , said one expert on the colorado s woes , who asked not to be identified to preserve his relationship with state officials there s always been within the current planning an embedded hope that somehow , things would return to something more like normal unfortunately , the colorado during most of lake mead s 78year history was not normal at all studies now show that the 20th century was one of the three wettest of the last 13 centuries in the colorado basin on average , the colorado s flow over that period was actually 15 percent lower than in the 1900s and most experts agree that the basin will get even drier concludes that rising temperatures will reduce the colorado s average flow after 2050 by five to 35 percent , even if rainfall remains the same and most of those studies predict that rains will diminish already , the drought is upending many of the assumptions on which water barons relied when they tamed the colorado in the 1900s the colorado basin states tried in the 1920s to stave off future fights over water by splitting it , 5050 , between the upperbasin states of utah , new mexico , colorado and wyoming and the lowerbasin states of arizona , nevada and california in fact , the deal underestimated how much water the fastgrowing lowerbasin states would need during most of the wet 20th century , however , the river usually produced more than enough water to offset any shortage now , the gap between need and supply is becoming untenable lake mead currently stands about 1 , 106 feet above sea level , and is expected to drop 20 feet in 2014 a continued decline would introduce a new set of problems at 1 , 075 feet , rationing begins at 1 , 050 feet , a more drastic rationing regime kicks in , and the uppermost water intake for las vegas shuts down at 1 , 025 feet , rationing grows more draconian at 1 , 000 feet , a second las vegas intake runs dry lake powell is another story there , a 100foot drop would shut down generators that supply enough electricity to power 350 , 000 homes the federal bureau of reclamation s 24month forecasts of water levels at powell and mead do not contemplate such steep declines but neither did they foresee the current drought we ca n't depend on history to project the future anymore , carly jerla , a geological hydrologist and the reclamation bureau s colorado river expert , said in an interview the drought could end tomorrow , she said or it could drag on for seven more years that raises questions that the states are just beginning to sort out the river s upperbasin states are worried that they might have to curb their consumption to meet their obligations downstream but the thorniest problems are in the lower basin , where a thicket of political and legal deals has left arizona holding the bag should the colorado river continue to diminish in the 1960s , california s legislators demanded first dibs on lowerbasin water as a condition of supporting federal legislation to build the , a vast web of canals irrigating that state s farms and cities should rationing begin in 2015 , arizona would sacrifice a comparatively small fraction of its colorado river allotment , while california s supply would remain intact painful as that would be , though , it could get worse should mead continue to fall , arizona would lose more than half of its colorado river water before california lost so much as a drop that would have a cascading effect the central arizona project would lose revenue it gets from selling water , which would raise the price of water to remaining customers , leading farmers to return to pumping groundwater for irrigation exactly what the central arizona project was supposed to prevent by going back to the pumps , you 'll have made the decision that agriculture will no longer be an industry in central arizona , david modeer , the project s general manager , said in an interview even californians doubt arizona would stand for that , but no successor to the 1960s agreement is in place and california has a vital interest in holding on to its full allotment of water the southern california region using colorado water is expected to add six million people to the existing 19 million in the next 45 years , and its other water source the sierra nevada to the north is suffering the same drought and climate problems as the colorado basin the basic blueprint of our plan calls for a reliable foundation that we then build upon , and that reliable foundation is the colorado river and northern california water , said jeffrey kightlinger , the general manager of the metropolitan water district of southern california to the extent we lose one of those supplies , i do n't know that there is enough technology and new supplies to replace them there may be ways to live with a permanently drier colorado , but none of them are easy finding more water is possible san diego is already building a desalination plant on the pacific shore but there are too few sources to make a serious dent in a shortage that leaves conservation , a tack the lowerbasin states already are pursuing arizona farmers reduce runoff , for example , the state consumes essentially as much water today as in 1955 , even as its population has grown nearly twelvefold by 20 percent per person from 2010 to 2020 , southern california s metropolitan water district is recycling sewage effluent , giving away highefficiency water nozzles and subsidizing items like artificial turf and zerowater urinals southern nevada s watersaving measures are in some ways most impressive of all virtually all water used indoors , from home dishwashers to the toilets and bathtubs used by the 40 million tourists who visit las vegas each year , is treated and returned to lake mead officials here boast that everyone could take a 20minute shower every day without increasing the city s water consumption by a drop moreover , an intensive conservation program slashed the region s water consumption from 2002 to 2012 , even as the area added 400 , 000 residents even after those measures , federal officials say , much greater conservation is possible local officials say they have little choice the era of big water transfers is either over , or it s rapidly coming to an end , said mr entsminger , the southern nevada water official it sure looks like in the 21st century , we 're all going to have to use less water
sydney , australia is anyone else bored with the seemingly endless tomes on modern motherhood \? i devoured dozens in the months after i first gave birth , but seven years later , i 'd like to hurl every book on good moms , bad moms , stretchedanddefensive moms , anxiousandexhausted moms and the misery of parenting today onto a raging bonfire each story seems to be framed by failure is n't it enough to love children fiercely \? and , perhaps , to keep them alive and upright \? and must we really continue to assume or at best , suspect that working and being a mother are fundamentally incompatible \? to illustrate this suspicion , we interrogate powerful and successful women about their families , and are swift to judge , evident in headlines like margaret thatcher a great prime minister but an awful mother' and golda meir mother of a nation , but not much of a mother the germans call them rabenm tter a pejorative term for mothers who act like ravens , abandoning their young in nests while they flitter off to work perhaps , when contemplating the impossible burden of perfection we place on mothers today , we should remember the victorian era , a less conventional time in many ways , when there was robust demand for wet nurses , and little boys wore pink dresses acceptable maternal behavior has taken starkly different guises over the past 200 years in the 1800s , a woman could be proud if her child reached primary school age out of every 1 , 000 born , around 150 died largely because of the prevalence of measles , whooping cough , scarlet fever and cholera , three out of 10 children did not live to age 5 in some towns in england , the death rate was almost twice as high some blamed the rather dubious practice of drugging babies with opium to calm them while their parents worked \( a piece published in 1850 in household words , the journal edited by charles dickens , blamed the ignorant hireling nurse who managed eight or nine babies at a time by keeping them drugged and quiet , almost , as death \) by the century s end , about 80 percent of parents took out insurance against their babies that practice was eventually frowned upon for encouraging infanticide yet the population of britain tripled between 1800 and 1900 as the british empire spread across the map and presiding over it all was the stout , blackclad figure of queen victoria , mother of nine and empress of millions she was the domestic queen , the world s most powerful working woman , who managed to reign over a quarter of the globe s inhabitants while insisting a woman s most important role was that of wife and mother yet in the 113 years since her death , a powerful myth has taken root that queen victoria disliked her children even , some say , all children a string of quotes are cited she preferred spending time with her husband , albert she thought newborns ugly , her children irritating and a burden she felt like a cow or a dog when pregnant , and loathed breastfeeding , calling one of her cows alice after one of her daughters , who decided to nurse her own children \( none of those sentiments , frankly , should be considered especially rare or obnoxious it is only today that we demand solely saccharine sentiments from women about their offspring \) now a remarkable and clever new book , censoring queen victoria how two gentlemen edited a queen and created an icon , by yvonne m ward , documents how the historical record was warped by the two men who edited victoria s official letters and defined her as subordinate queen in the words of her biographer lytton strachey , a mere accessory to the men who surrounded her ms ward , who wrote a dissertation on the same subject , began comparing the three official volumes of victoria s letters to the more than 460 volumes of correspondence in the royal archives in the windsor tower , while researching the queen as a wife and mother she grew curious about the men who edited the letters and why they chose to obscure victoria s private life and motherhood it turned out that their mission was to protect victoria as well as her eldest son , edward vii , from the hint of any scandal at all they cut out suggestions , for instance , that she was infatuated with her first prime minister , lord melbourne the man given the task was viscount esher , an adviser to king edward vii he hired the eton housemaster arthur benson to edit it both were gay both found the editing experience overwhelming and onerous both also , crucially , viewed victoria as ancillary to the men around her they wrote in their introduction confident , in a sense , as she was , she had the feminine instinct strongly developed of dependence upon some manly adviser only 40 percent of the letters in the volumes of her letters are actually hers most of the others are written to her by prominent men , and the correspondence with female relatives and friends is scant the small number of women s letters in the published volumes , writes ms ward , cannot be attributed to the editor s ignorance of their existence in truth , benson was bored by correspondence between women it was very tiresome yet the letters victoria exchanged with the young queen of portugal , donna maria , which were almost entirely excluded , reveal a great preoccupation with their young , the joys of children and the pains of giving birth ms ward writes despite these women s privileged living conditions , rank and wealth in the nineteenth century provided no guarantee against disease and infection the letters between these two royal mothers show their many anxieties concerning their own health and that of their children breastfeeding and wet nurses , smallpox inoculations , weaning and teething , then education , anxiety about their husband s health at times , queen victoria was a critical mother , but as her personal diaries reveal , she also loved her children , thought about them constantly and was deeply interested in the minutiae of their lives to dismiss her as a bad mother is to simply ignore the evidence as we so often do with women in the public eye , we focus on absence and not affection so , what about those neglectful rabenm tter \? it turns out that the ravens derided in that german expression are in fact attentive mothers their young stay with them for several weeks , and both parents feed them sounds like a model we should not deride , but aspire to
washington the senate on monday confirmed s nominee for surgeon general , ending a long fight over gun control and politics that had left the country without a permanent top doctor for a year and a half in an earlyevening vote , dr vivek h murthy , an internal medicine physician , was approved ,  the confirmation was one of the last acts of business for the democraticcontrolled senate had it not moved , the nomination would have died , making it unlikely the president would have been able to get anyone approved to the post for the remainder of his time in the white house democrats said there was no compelling reason to delay the murthy nomination , especially as the nation s public health system remains on edge after the ebola outbreak in west africa and a number of recent scares at american hospitals in a statement applauding the vote , mr obama directly cited the threat from ebola and said that dr murthy s confirmation would help make the country safer vivek s confirmation makes us better positioned to save lives around the world and protect the american people here at home , the president said but republicans saw dr murthy as a politically connected supporter of mr obama s who would use his position to push for stricter gun control though the surgeon general s office does not set or carry out gun policy , dr murthy s support for banning the sale of certain weapons and ammunition , as well as for longer waiting periods for firearms sales , drew the ire of gun rights advocates like the national rifle association the association said it would include the vote in its calculation to determine how senators fare on its annual scorecard , an attempt to dissuade lawmakers from voting yes earlier this year , as many as 10 democrats were considering voting against dr murthy their wavering forced the white house to ask the majority leader , senator harry reid , to delay a vote in march but in the end , the political immunity of lame duck status was too much to overcome even the nra senators mark begich of alaska , mary l landrieu of louisiana and mark pryor of arkansas , all democrats who lost in november , voted for dr murthy other democrats from conservativeleaning states who voted yes included senators jon tester of montana and claire mccaskill of missouri just one republican , mark s kirk of illinois , voted for the nomination democrats who voted no were joe manchin iii of west virginia , heidi heitkamp of north dakota and joe donnelly of indiana none of what dr murthy said on guns was out of step with the american public opinion , surveys show he favored more restrictions on who can own guns and how they can be purchased , views he said stemmed from his experience seeing the effects of gun violence firsthand as a physician in the emergency room senator richard blumenthal , democrat of connecticut , said that dr murthy was being punished for telling the truth the simple fact is gun violence impacts far too many people , he said , running down a list of statistics about gun deaths pointing out these facts and asking whether there are strategies we could apply to bring that number down is exactly what a person tasked to keep americans healthy ought to be doing senator john barrasso , republican of wyoming and a surgeon , said dr murthy was more advocate than physician americans want the same thing from a surgeon general that they all want from their own doctors , he said people want honest and straightforward advice about medical dangers like cancer , like heart attacks , like stroke they do n't want an inexperienced , unqualified political appointee in addition to his stance on guns , dr murthy s background troubled republicans and some democrats he helped found a group called doctors for obama that supported the president s 2008 campaign and later fought for the passage of the affordable care act under the new name doctors for america mr manchin , the west virginia democrat , said he believed that dr murthy s close political association to the president would be difficult for people to see past i truly do not believe that he will be able to do the job that needs to be done in such difficult and challenging times because of his political involvement , mr manchin said dr murthy teaches at brigham and women s hospital and harvard medical school

on nov 6 , 2004 , nato forces launched an assault on falluja , a city north of baghdad that had become a magnet for sunni insurgent forces thomas brennan , then a 19yearold marine corps lance corporal , was one of the infantrymen with first battalion , eighth marine regiment who would participate in the attack the battalion suffered numerous casualties in the battle , one of the bloodiest for american forces since vietnam now a journalism student , mr brennan recalls the battle with the help of some of the marines and sailors he fought beside grains of sand floated through motionless air as beams of light crept through sandbagged windows young men sat mesmerized by the words echoing from walls scarred by years of war through cigarette smoke and desert confetti , doug bahrns , who was then a marine second lieutenant , exuded confidence and trepidation as he explained over two hours the details of our mission and what should happen when not if we were wounded he paused often , gazing into the darkness above our heads he knew he wouldn t bring us all home now a major assigned to marine corps base quantico in virginia , major bahrns recalled recently the weight he felt leading marines into such a largescale fight where it was inevitable someone was going to get killed nov 10 , 2004 , is one of the most significant days of my life , changing not only my life , but other s lives , major bahrns said it put into perspective life , death and the brotherhood within military service that was the first day , alongside my fellow marines , that i truly felt i d cemented my place among them ten years ago , roughly 13 , 500 american , british and iraqi forces attacked falluja , iraq , where roughly 4 , 000 insurgents fought from trenches , tunnels and houses , using improvised explosive devices , rifles , rockets and machine guns during the 46day battle , roughly 2 , 000 insurgents were killed and 1 , 500 captured by dec 23 , 107 members of coalition forces had died and 613 were wounded alongside lieutenant bahrns , in alpha company , first battalion , eighth marine regiment , 17 died and 102 were wounded it was the heaviest urban combat since the 1968 battle of hue city during the vietnam war before lieutenant bahrns s first sunset in falluja , he screamed for a corpsman to save his good friend , first lt daniel t malcolm lieutenant malcolm loved to study military tactics as much as he loved playing chess , which to him was yet another way he could train his mind to defeat an opponent if life were a brilliancy a deeply strategic chess match he made his a brevity , which is winning a chess game in 25 moves his age when he was killed in action i regret playing chess with lieutenant malcolm only once after four months of convoys as his driver , i struggle now that i didn t allow myself to hurt when he died i was never lucky enough to befriend the man i admired most sgt billy leo is everything i imagine a bronx native to be crude and opinionated with a hair trigger , once tearing my yankees suck tshirt from my body i can t count how many times he pointed out my mistakes , but i cherish the times he gave me his approval falluja got the better of me once i came home i really missed it even though it sucked , said mr leo , a 37yearold new york city firefighter there isn t one day where i don t think about that battle it was a lot of adrenaline , he added nothing will ever give you that feeling again mike ergo , then a corporal , admired sergeant leo s leadership and feared wearing red sox attire november , for mr ergo , is no longer a month he avoids his daughter adeline was born on nov 4 , 2010 , and his career providing peer support to other veterans led him to pursue a master s degree in clinical social work working as a counselor at the department of veterans affairs vet center in concord , calif , has helped him come home battling guilt , loss and grief for years , mr ergo credits his career with helping him overcome living with the loss of life , both american and iraqi i d do it all again , even if i knew i wouldn t agree with the political reasons or if i knew all of the fighting wouldn t bring peace to the region , said mr ergo , 31 the level of love and commitment we have for our fellow marines means that you ll go through hell with them not wanting to trade places with anyone fighting alongside us in first platoon was staff sgt adam banotai in his squad of 17 , he watched 11 marines become casualties his platoon earned 37 purple heart medals and five awards for valor it petrifies me that i made a decision that was based off of my feelings and not good tactical judgment , said mr banotai none of what my guys say makes me stop thinking i could have pushed them harder , saved them from shedding so much blood those men are my heroes since nov 26 , 2004 , reinaldo aponte , then a petty officer third class line corpsman , has felt pained when he remembered the marine he could not save he was pulled away from lance cpl bradley faircloth s body believing he had done his best but replaying the situation in his mind since , he still wonders could he have done more \? i didn t look at any of the marines i was so angry , screaming incoherently i cried , feeling like i d let my squad down , said mr aponte , now 31 , of milwaukee i was scared they wouldn t trust me anymore i didn t want them to be afraid to call on me as their corpsman i needed to remain a part of the squad i was afraid of losing all of them because i lost brad as the chaplain for our battalion , lt dennis cox spent hours with us discussing our concerns he tried to justify killing the enemy he prayed for each of us he wiped tears from our eyes he cleaned the blood from the faces of our fallen he too , cannot stop reliving our battle he is now a commander in the chaplain corps at naval station norfolk in virginia when they die , a part of you goes with them , commander cox said we smell something , we see something , we hear something and it triggers something we were doing 10 years ago over the years , commander cox has stayed in touch with the families of our fallen just like us , he considers them family for him , it s a painful reminder of how much they lost kathleen faircloth knew what to expect her son , bradley , was wounded twice before the second battle of falluja marines standing in their dress uniforms at her front door meant only one thing for 10 years , she hasn t showed anger toward our platoon instead , she is glad we remember her son as long as his memory is alive , she said , she will find happiness i lost a son , but i gained children across the country i know that if i ever needed anything , they would do anything they could to help me , said ms faircloth , now 50 , of fairhope , ala i hope they find peace in their heart , because seeing them miserable isn t how i want to see them whether still in uniform or having moved on to a different chapter of our lives , remembering is something we can t fail to do while some have a memorial in massachusetts , alabama or at the citadel , some veterans of falluja remember each of their fallen brethren through writing , by advocating for the iraqi families we displaced , or by displaying the noble and true face of our generation in the last 10 years , we ve lost sons , brothers , wives and children , struggling to maintain our own sanity and even after many failed attempts , we continue helping one another from becoming part of the suicide epidemic some of us , much like in falluja , are still bounding

new orleans ben forster , a 33yearold british actor , was preparing for the biggest break of his career as he rehearsed the title role for an ambitious arena tour of that was to have its first performance here at the lakefront arena on june 9 that was thursday on friday , mr forster , an ensemble of celebrity performers and a cast and crew of about 300 learned that they were all out of work the tour , which was to play more than 50 cities in north america over the summer , was canceled without warning or explanation for me , it was the american dream about to happen , mr forster said in an interview on friday night what s that miley cyrus song , wrecking ball' \? i feel like someone just came in and took a big wrecking ball to the jesus christ superstar' tour this tour s highprofile promoter , , who has mainly worked with rock groups like u2 and the rolling stones and was a lead producer of the problemplagued broadway musical said on saturday that ticket sales did not support the tour , even though backers spent millions of dollars and enlisted an army of people to promote the tour it became obvious the shows were in trouble , but we tried until the last moment to give it every chance to turn around , mr cohl said in an email in the end , it just did not make business sense to continue , and we did n't want the cast to endure playing to disappointing audiences this latest production of andrew lloyd webber and tim rice s rock opera about the final days of jesus was announced with fanfare in april , including in new york and on abc s good morning america the cast featured an eclectic mix of rock and pop performers in the principal roles , including the incubus lead singer , brandon boyd , as judas iscariot michelle williams , of the rb group destiny s child , as mary magdalene jc chasez of nsync as pontius pilate and john lydon , aka johnny rotten of the sex pistols , as king herod the aggressive itinerary included stops at 18 , 000 to 20 , 000seat theaters like madison square garden in new york and the staples center in los angeles , with top ticket prices of about 125 in april , mr cohl said that total costs were in the range of eight figures and that the tour would need to take in several hundred thousand dollars each night to keep it afloat as recently as thursday , cast members like mr boyd and mr forster were working in new orleans with the director laurence connor \( a director of the current broadway revival of les mis rables \) mr lydon was being fitted for his king herod costume and making his first attempts at rehearsing his character s  the next morning , mr forster and mr chasez were rehearsing with mr connor when the show s general manager entered the studio describing what happened next , mr forster said , he was like guys , take a break we need to chat it s not going to happen' at this point , in his recollection , mr forster simply gasped mr boyd , who has no previous musicaltheater experience , said he suspected he was being hazed i thought it was like a prank that you pull on the new guy , he said but no in london , some 70 members of the british ensemble cast who were preparing to travel to the new orleans rehearsal also received the bad news several of themselves on social media , extending their middle fingers to the camera \( as a show of solidarity , their celebrity cast mates in america of themselves making the same gesture \) the collapse of jesus christ superstar is another black eye for mr cohl and his production company , s2bn entertainment , which was presenting the tour with the really useful group , mr lloyd webber s company mr cohl is trying to regain his footing after the closing of spiderman turn off the dark , a 75 million production that received widely negative reviews and that after a troubled and unprofitable threeyear run mr cohl said on saturday that a tour of the spiderman musical was still planned , to begin in the fall of 2015 mr cohl was also among the producers of a night with janis joplin , the broadway musical whose planned transfer to the gramercy theater was at the last minute in an interview before jesus christ superstar was shut down , mr cohl was asked whether his grab bag of star performers a potentially incompatible mix of girl and boyband alumni , hard rockers and punk rockers would be enough to generate widespread ticket sales well , we 're going to find out , are n't we \? he answered ed rubinstein , the chief executive of arenanetwork , a company that helps book entertainment acts into performance spaces , said he saw no indication of any advance problems with the jesus christ superstar tour everything seemed to be moving along fine , and sales were decent , said mr rubinstein , who had booked the tour into about 20 places all expectations and hopes were that the marketing would have generated additional sales as we got closer , he said others in the industry questioned whether american audiences would be interested in the lineup none of these performers would appear to have the boxoffice clout to ensure robust ticket sales , , a pop music critic for the san diego uniontribune mr forster , who won his role and has previously played jesus in superstar on tours of britain and australia , said he was concerned by how little interest the american news media seemed to show in the new production for these previous tours , we did lots of tv , he said we did heaps of radio i felt like it was neverending phone interviews for different publications in the united states , he said , i 've done four interviews , to come and sell out several thousand tickets \( mr lydon and mr boyd said they had encountered similar apathy \) mr lydon , never one to hold his tongue , strongly rebuked mr cohl in an interview on friday night i had a runin with the alleged promoter in new york , mr lydon said i did n't like him and i instinctively did n't trust him mr cohl s treatment of cast and crew members , who set aside months of their lives for the tour , has been devoid of human contact , mr lydon said the excuses are going to have to be phenomenal , he said with a mischievous smile , he added , all that mr cohl had to do was ring me up , and i 'd have lent him 5 before he embarked on a night of red wine and gallows humor , mr forster tried to put a positive face on the day s disastrous experience i believe in fate , and whatever s around the corner is about to come , he said i 'll keep trying god loves a trier , right \? when mr lydon was asked what he might try for a followup project , he replied , i'm going to be doing the ballet next
by late 1864 , the anaconda strategy devised by gen winfield scott at the start of the war was reaching its lethal conclusion the implacable , relentless naval blockade had crippled the south s cotton economy , and drained the rebel army of its ability to wage battle still , daring blockade runners helped maintain a supply of goods that were as vital as they were meager their preferred port had always been wilmington , nc , but after federal forces captured mobile , ala , in august 1864 , it was also their last with its railroad connections to virginia , wilmington was the last vein through which the south received goods from the outside world , and the last artery to its army now federal forces focused on severing that link wilmington is 28 miles up the cape fear river from the atlantic ocean one of several but by far the most formidable of the confederate positions guarding wilmington was fort fisher , located right at the mouth of the river fort fisher was built at the end of a narrow peninsula that is shaped like an inverted triangle on the east side is the atlantic , on the west , the river anything entering the river had to pass under the guns of what had come to be called the gibraltar of the south no one would have used so respectful a sobriquet at the start of the war , when fort fisher s defenses consisted of a few obsolete cannons lodged behind palmetto logs however , under col william lamb , who took command in 1862 , fort fisher developed a more powerful posture lamb had no formal training as an engineer , but several years earlier as a 27yearold former newspaper editor , he had taken a special interest in the crimean war , when cannons positioned atop the malakoff tower had enabled the russians at sevastopol to withstand a french naval siege for almost a year early in the war , lamb personally learned a related lesson when in may 1861 he had been present at an artillery duel between a rebel battery stationed at sewell s point , va , and union gunboats in the chesapeake bay below the gunboats often found their mark , lamb observed , but the loosely packed dirt of the confederate earthworks swallowed the shells and absorbed the impact walls of brick or stone might make a defender feel more secure , but shells fired by modern rifled cannons bore into such defenses and quickly broke them down looking at the infinite supply of sand sitting at his very feet , lamb envisioned a fort fisher that would consist of armed towers , like at sevastopol , but made of forgiving , absorbent sand over the next two years , as many as a thousand workers a day soldiers , slaves , freed blacks , impressed indians built a complex of more than two dozen mounds interconnected , and with excavated vaults to protect men and ammo during bombardments , the mounds stood about 30 feet high , and were crowned with cannons lamb arrayed fort fisher s defenses on two fronts a land face stretched 1 , 800 feet across the peninsula west to east until it met the atlantic there it met the sea face , which then went south for a mile along the ocean to the mouth of the river , where the defenses were anchored by a massive 60foot mound topped by two powerful cannons , dubbed the buchanan battery at the intersection of the faces was a 30foot mound called the northeast bastion , which was heavily armed and considered the fort s strongest point how odd this must have looked from the sea the flat sandy peninsula , haphazardly decorated with patches of beach grass and a handful of windtwisted trees , topped by these gigantic primitive dirt mounds that were bristling with guns lamb not only improved the defenses of fort fisher he brought a new pugnacity shortly after taking command , he spotted federal ships anchored a mile offshore he was surprised to hear that this was a fairly typical arrangement the yanks would sit in the ocean , and occasionally fire on the fort whenever it suited them lamb was appalled from that point on , when federal blockaders ventured within range , fort fisher opened fire and chased them out to sea in time , blockade runners nearing the coast began to look for the lights of fort fisher to tell them that the most perilous part of their journey was ending , that they were now under the fort s protection but fort fisher was always undermanned at its peak , the garrison had just 1 , 600 men , and often there were many fewer union commanders had long contemplated assaulting fort fisher , but not until september 1864 , after other objectives had been taken , did general grant finally allocate 6 , 500 troops from the army of the james to join the navy s north atlantic blockading squadron for a combined landsea operation to take fort fisher the troops were placed under the command of maj gen godfrey weitzel , a 29yearold bavarianborn graduate of west point command of the naval forces was assigned to adm david dixon porter , who had scored great victories at new orleans and , in collaboration with grant , at vicksburg a complicated man , porter was once described by navy secretary gideon welles as boastful of his own powers , given to exaggeration reckless , improvident and too assuming , but also as possessing stirring and positive qualities , is fertile in resources , and has great energy porter would command a fleet of 57 ships as the combined forces made their way to the fort , weitzel received an unhappy surprise his superior at the army of the james , gen benjamin butler , decided to come along butler , a political general , had attained notoriety during his tenure as military governor of new orleans , where he was alternately called beast , because of his rude treatment of southern ladies who insulted union officers , and spoons , because he allegedly pocketed silverware from the southern homes where he stayed as 1864 waned , butler smelled that fort fisher might provide one of the war s final chances to reap the glory of victory moreover , butler had an idea for a secret weapon a floating bomb the original union plan of attack was straightforward have porter s fleet bombard fort fisher , then send butler s 6 , 500 soldiers to finish off the survivors but once porter arrived off the carolina coast in middecember , he recognized that the sandy mounds threatened to neutralize the power of his bombardment moreover , the full speed ahead dash past the guns that he had used so effectively at vicksburg would be impossible here the ships that blitzed through would just pile up in the cape fear river , and await destruction by the buchanan battery porter had little liking for butler , but he suddenly wanted to hear more about butler s secret plan which was actually well past the planning stage an aging gunboat , the louisiana , had been stripped down , had its guns removed and part of its dock house removed in norfolk , it had been loaded in with 215 tons of black powder more than 50 times the amount that had produced the crater in petersburg just five months before and then sailed for beaufort , where it had been primed the ship was now a giant bomb the plan was for a small crew to anchor her as close to fort fisher as possible , set the three 90minute fuses aboard \( a fuse , a backup and a backup for the backup \) , and board an escort steamer that would dash to a zone of presumed safety after that \? one school of thought believed fort fisher would be flattened another thought the effect would be mild , the explosion s impact dissolving into thin air i take a mean between the two , said porter , reasonably and pseudoscientifically i think the effect of the explosion will simply be very severe stunning men at a distance of three or four hundred yards , demoralizing them completely , and making them unable to stand for any length of time a fire from a ship he also expected that buildings would tumble , guns would be buried , houses would collapse if the rebels fight after the explosion , said porter , they have more in them than i give them credit for whatever the impact , porter planned to follow up with a massive naval bombardment of the fort , before butler s troops marched in just after midnight on dec 23 , guided by fort fisher s own lights , louisiana was towed to a point 250 yards away from the fort there , 43yearold commander alexander rhind and his crew ignited the three fuses , then skedaddled , but not before rhind took the extra precaution of setting fire to the louisiana once they reached safety , they waited had any of the fuses worked as planned , the louisiana would have blown up at 1 18 in the morning in the event , it wasn t until 1 40 that the bomb exploded , thanks to the fire rhind started as an afterthought the ship erupted , producing a massive flash of light , a dust cloud , a low , heavy boom , a sulfurous , malodorous cloud that passed over the fleet , and no damage it was terrible , one sarcastic rebel later said it woke up nearly everybody in the fort the fort would have to be taken the oldfashioned way at noon the next day , porter brought the fleet close to shore and opened fire over the next five hours , his 627 guns discharged approximately 10 , 000 rounds something like 115 a minute directly onto the embracing , forgiving sands of fort fisher the mighty discharge of ordnance resulted in one confederate dead , 22 injured , and two guns disabled the fort s comparatively puny reply 622 shells left 83 of porter s men dead or wounded porter , of course , had expected to unleash all this hell to pave a path for butler s invasion , but the dilatory general did not appear until nightfall , when he showed up with a few transports , and promises that the rest of the men would be along directly with the hour too late to begin landing , a furious porter sent him away operations would have to commence in the morning and indeed , on christmas morning , porter resumed his bombardment , sending several more thousands of shells landward several hours later , up the coast , general weitzel managed to land a couple thousand soldiers on shore north of the fort the troops advanced to within 100 yards of the land face , where they were stopped by blasts of canister from guns that porter believed his bombardment had destroyed weitzel reported what he had seen to butler i told him it would be murder to order an attack upon that work and butler did not disagree looking to the skies , butler decided that the weather was changing against him , and disregarding grant s specific , thisishowiwonvicksburg order to dig in , ordered a withdrawal of his men most got off butler abandoned the final 700 nothing further can be done by the land forces , butler informed porter , and announced that he and his men were heading back to virginia porter , who in cooperation with grant at vicksburg had created the very model of combined armynavy operations , was shocked and furious he ordered his ships to continue the bombardment in support of the abandoned soldiers , and the next day , when the wind changed , he brought the wet , chilled troops off the beach their casualties , however , were light one man had drowned , and 11 were wounded , proving that blood was not a factor in butler s decision to depart the beast simply wasn t that interested in giving battle once the magic floating bomb proved to be a dud having collected butler s men , porter , lacking any other option , withdrew as well the rebels could not believe their luck you can now inspect the works and walk on nothing but iron , one officer remarked none could understand why the yankees had not attacked at that moment , fort fisher s garrison numbered only 500 men to learn more about this subject , see war on the waters , by james m mcpherson , and divided waters the naval

sandwich , england last tuesday , on the front page of the daily telegraph of london , which i buy like thousands of other dementiafearers because of the kindly crossword , i saw the face of a young woman at the general synod at york with a bright teardrop sliding down her cheek i thought , oh dear ! more misery newspapers now are only frigates of misery but the gleaming teardrop was not for sorrow it was for joy ! this girl , in an ecclesiastical , once exclusively male , dog collar , was weeping for joy because the synod , which governs the church of england , had at last decided to allow women to become bishops not that there are not some tough preliminaries the dog collar has to be earned and more but starting next year , if all goes well , a female anglican priest will be able to become even an archbishop should she believe she is called to do the job and she does n't even have to look like a male bishop \( when i was a child i was not sure that bishops were men anyway their clothes floated like women s or angels' , though their faces were not exactly female \) a female priest we have had them since the synod approved them in 1992 looks as she wishes there were some in very high heels and plate hats at a royal garden party i once attended she can prance about and squirt champagne at her friends \( not that they were doing that at the garden party \) , and she can be noisy as a schoolgirl and wear a sort of sackcloth frill below the waist with a slimline halflength cassock above she can be affectionate to male bishops in public and be married to another priest goodness knows what else she can do my first thought when i read the news was to get in touch with my mother , but no luck , for she died in 1980 she said \( often \) i'm sorry i do not like the thought of it my mother used to bow in church if a bishop was in the procession she had been taught that by her highanglican church aunt jane , who did n't let her eat before communion until , that is , my mother began to faint away my mother really would have liked to be catholic in the hands of priests who were icily celibate and safe and did n't need women around \( though christ did , as i often told her \) and female bishops ! good heavens ! and yet in yorkshire for a thousand years we had formidable female saints who could eat any number of male bishops for breakfast with their flagons of ale , including the glorious hilda , abbess of whitby , a unisex establishment of both monks and nuns whitby abbey , more than 1 , 350 years old , stands now roofless and looks on the clifftop rather like a rotten tooth but even roofless , to this day it is said you 'll never see birds fly over its grassy nave it is too holy they fall down dead hilda was a royal northumbrian whose father was poisoned by a neighboring king she became abbess of hartlepool , on the north bank of the river tees , and traces of the wharves where her ships were tied can still be seen embedded in the harbor wall later , she founded the monastery and convent at whitby in 664 , the synod of whitby was held there and the decision was taken reluctantly at first by her to turn the face of the english church toward rome she later died , after seven years of a burning fever , praying for a church at peace it was one of her laborers whose lovely hymn to creation is known as the first written english poem often , tending his cattle on the clifftop , he must have seen the dawn , the sun rising above the sea like the first day of the world she made him a monk then , farther south in kent , there was st mildred , whose mother , in 670 , founded the minster that still stands there in good nick with nine nuns who are an everpresent help in trouble to all religions and none mildred was also the master of a shipping line that ran up and down the thames estuary there is a shadowy little carving of her above the gate they are catholic nuns there , and do not ask them their opinion of female bishops they are too busy but i'm sure they pray about it we are straying from the front page of the daily telegraph i turn back to it again and find that i know her , this teardrop girl she is now the rev kat campionspall of merton , south london , my old parish the dog collar suits her i think that hilda , mildred and all the women who have been essentially running the church since the seventh century perhaps even my mother would agree i see her possible future in crosier , cope and miter and i wonder what some male bishops of the past like thomas of canterbury would have made of her would she have gone swearing and cursing to her death in the cathedral , as it is said that he did \? who knows \? perhaps she would have been more feminine , but just as strong , putting up a pretty good fight for unity and peace , and shedding a grateful teardrop on a stillghastly world
the nba finals were billed as a repeat of one of the most competitive series in history the defending champion may have won their 201213 series against the , but you had to really squint to see the difference between the two teams at the end of seven intense games , the san antonio spurs had actually outscored the miami heat by five points despite all expectations , the rematch has been shockingly onesided the spurs have taken a 31 lead and , perhaps more impressively , have outscored the heat by 53 points , including two straight blowouts on the heat s home court the precise and lethal spurs have eviscerated the heat defense through four games the spurs are averaging 119 points per 100 possessions , a rate 15 points better than they posted during last season s finals they are shooting 54 percent from the field and a stunning 47 percent from 3point range it is not the hot shooting that is so impressive , but all the open shots spurs coach gregg popovich has his team perfectly prepared to exploit the heat s defensive tactics at all times , the spurs have played four players who are comfortable on the perimeter , creating extra space for the heat to defend to make things worse for miami , the spurs are running countless pickandrolls and hand offs , two maneuvers that the heat typically defend by doubling the ball handler these traps are meant to force turnovers and disrupt the offense , but the spurs have built their game plan around exploiting this aggressiveness the spurs do not run these pickandrolls to score immediately , but rather to create easy baskets a few passes later their choreography has been immaculate , and they have relentlessly attacked the heat defenders off the dribble as they scramble to recover from the initial pickandroll the heat defense , long predicated on the unique athletic capabilities of players like dwyane wade and lebron james , has looked shoddy and confused it is jarring to see miami surrender so many open layups and uncontested 3pointers a major source of the heat s frustration is boris diaw , a player who was released from the charlotte bobcats , the worst team in recent nba history , but has been a key to the spurs' success diaw is a fantastic passer and dribbler for a power forward he came into the league as a much skinnier guard and his creativity adds the extra stress needed to break the heat s defense when diaw shares the court with manu ginobili , another ace passer , san antonio has been unstoppable in 87 minutes together this finals , lineups with diaw and ginobili have outscored the heat by an  asked in an espn interview why the spurs were so hard to guard , james replied everyone is live , meaning no spur allows the heat defense to catch a breather the spurs have talented role players , but the other reason the heat defense cannot find relief is that these role players have been conditioned to make quick decisions they move the ball immediately and with a purpose , either with the pass or the dribble the heat have tried a few different tactics , but none have disrupted the spur s quick decisions and aggressive , confident play all of this has happened despite strong individual performances from james , who is scoring more points and scoring them more efficiently than he did in last season s finals but his surges have largely been in vain james pumped in 19 points in a futile third quarter in game 4 the game was already out of reach the two other members of the heat s big 3 , chris bosh and wade , have not kept up their end of the bargain bosh has been bullied inside and is averaging just 48 rebounds per game after performing strongly in earlier rounds of the playoffs , wade has taken a sudden nose dive wade is a poor 3point shooter , and the spurs are essentially ignoring him on the perimeter usually , his superb athleticism and skills near the basket allow him to score despite his longrange deficiency his legs look tired and weak , however , and without his burst at the rim , he has submarined the heat s offense his poor work on defense has compounded his lack of production in last year s finals , the heat also struggled to score with wade on the court at this point , heat coach erik spoelstra may consider dramatically reducing wade s minutes but whom can he play in wade s stead \? the options are dishearteningly limited while the spurs have contributors up and down the roster , the heat seem to be out of answers this is in part a result of how each franchise acquires talent four of the spurs' top eight players have been in the league fewer than five seasons the backup point guard norris cole is the only heat rotation player who was drafted in the last five years instead of investing in young talent , the heat have accumulated a group of stable veterans like ray allen and rashard lewis who can withstand the intense scrutiny that accompanies playing with james this strategy helped the heat win two titles but , somewhat amazingly , in this series the team with james often appears to be the less athletic squad it s easy to critique the heat now , but just a week ago they seemed primed for a third straight title the reality is this the san antonio offense is functioning better than any in recent memory the spurs have ascended to a kind of basketball nirvana , and not even james and the heat have been able to disrupt them
washington just hours before he publicly responded last week to the senate intelligence committee report accusing the of torture and deceit , , the cia s director , stopped by the white house to meet with  ostensibly , he was there for an intelligence briefing but the messages delivered later that day by the white house and mr brennan were synchronized , even down to similar wording , and the larger import of the welltimed visit was hardly a classified secret after six years of partnership , the president was standing by the embattled spy chief even as fellow democrats called for his resignation that s not to say there was no friction between the west wing and the cia s langley , va , headquarters after the release of the scorching report irritated advisers to mr obama believe mr brennan made a bad situation worse by battling democrats on the committee over the report during the past year some who considered mr brennan the president s heat shield against the agency when he worked in the white house now worry that since being appointed director , he has gone native , as they put it but in the 67 years since the cia was founded , few presidents have had as close a bond with their intelligence chiefs as mr obama has forged with mr brennan it is a relationship that has shaped the policy and politics of the debate over the nation s war with terrorist organizations , as well as the agency s own struggle to balance security and liberty and the result is a president who denounces torture but not the people accused of inflicting it the quandary that brennan faces is similar to the quandary that obama faces , said david cole , a national security scholar and law professor at georgetown university both are personally opposed to what went on and deeply troubled by what went on and agree that it should never happen again and both are ultimately dependent on the cia for important national security services indeed , rather than give his own speech on the report s accusations against the cia , mr obama left it to mr brennan to be the administration s public face it is fairly remarkable that the lead responder here is the director of the cia , said daniel benjamin , the state department s top counterterrorism official during mr obama s first term and now at dartmouth but that may be a reflection of the administration s original decision to cordon off the issue and not have a broader partisan blood bath over the bush white house s involvement in torture in responding to the report , mr brennan walked a line between his president and his agency he again embraced mr obama s decision after taking office to ban interrogation techniques like waterboarding , nudity and sleep deprivation but he criticized only the limited number of cia officers who exceeded broad justice department rules governing interrogations and he flatly rejected the committee s contentions that the interrogation program was not central to thwarting terror plots and that the agency had misled the public about its effectiveness , although he said it was unknowable whether detainees talked specifically because of the brutal methods current and former colleagues said mr brennan had an institutional responsibility to guard his building if john were retired and had a few drinks in him , he might have a different tone to him , said william m daley , mr obama s former chief of staff but he ca n't , nor should he , do anything other than what he s done but guarding the building is a markedly different role than mr brennan played as mr obama s counterterrorism adviser in the first term , when he helped recalibrate the terror war by trying to close the prison at guant namo bay , cuba , and by reining in perceived excesses on all of the debates , he was on our side on almost all of them , said a former white house official , who like others did not want to be named describing internal deliberations mr brennan , 59 , who spent much of his career as an arabicspeaking cia officer , has been a central figure in mr obama s world since the beginning of his presidency built like a linebacker , with a hardened face , closecropped retreating hair and an intense gaze , mr brennan looks the part of a grim counterterrorism agent more than one obama aide compared him to a grizzled city cop , and all of them testified to his herculean work ethic a native of north bergen , nj , mr brennan attended fordham university , spent time in indonesia and egypt and earned a master s degree in middle east studies at the university of texas at austin before answering a newspaper ad for the cia he rose through the ranks to become station chief in saudi arabia and a favorite of george j tenet , then the cia director , who made him his chief of staff and later the agency s deputy executive director he was a pretty good analyst he was a bright guy , said melvin a goodman , a former cia officer who is now a senior fellow at the center for international policy and a sharp critic of the agency but he always had a reputation of sucking up to power and moving in the direction of power and not being able to exercise any independence after the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , mr brennan helped set up the terrorist threat integration center , later reorganized as the national counterterrorism center but he was not made its permanent director and , disaffected with president george w bush s administration , he retired from the cia in 2005 and became a public critic brought into mr obama s orbit , mr brennan was the new president s first choice to become cia director , but that unraveled when democrats protested his association with mr tenet s leadership mr brennan has said he opposed waterboarding during mr bush s tenure , but not every brutal interrogation method in 2007 , he told the new yorker that the united states would be handicapped if the cia was not , in fact , able to carry out these types of detention and debriefing activities after mr obama s election , mr brennan argued that he had not been part of the interrogation program and opposed different aspects of it while concurring with others he acknowledged that he had once argued for keeping open the secret cia prisons but that conditions had changed and i 've changed my views in the end , he had to settle for the white house job , but that may have worked out better for him because it sealed his relationship with mr obama , a former law school instructor with little national security background somebody like the president , who does n't have that background , will end up gravitating to someone who does , mr daley said whether it was a wouldbe underwear bomber or shootings at fort hood , mr brennan exuded a confident competence that reassured a new president and his staff i slept better knowing that john brennan never does , recalled david axelrod , then mr obama s senior adviser another former aide described mr obama and mr brennan as kindred spirits in a lowceilinged , windowless basement office next door to denis r mcdonough , who would later become white house chief of staff , mr brennan was entrusted with an outsized role running the war on terrorist groups he managed kill lists for drone strikes and could order air attacks in yemen without getting further approval from the president brennan s control over his area was as complete as anyone s control over anything in the white house , another former senior official said he came to be identified with the escalation of america s secret war in yemen and the successful raid that killed osama bin laden , but he was also an ally of those resisting more hawkish policies in afghanistan and libya , and advocated freeing wrongly held detainees at guant namo he also made it easier for the president to restrain cia adventures he could grill the agency as no other obama adviser could he understands them intimately and was constantly raising hard and tough questions , said harold koh , then the state department s legal adviser and now a yale law school professor but neither mr obama nor mr brennan was eager to take on the cia too often the cia gets what it needs , mr obama declared at one early meeting , according to people there he did n't want them to feel like he was an enemy , said a former aide mr brennan likewise was protective of cia interests he tried to excise the word torture from white house documents , only to be overruled and when leon e panetta , who became mr obama s cia director , negotiated an agreement with the senate intelligence committee for an inquiry into torture , mr brennan erupted it did not take long to get ugly , mr panetta recalled in his memoir brennan and i even exchanged sharp words mr brennan could not reverse the deal , but since becoming cia director last year he has fought constantly with democrats on the committee over the torture report during one meeting , mr brennan grew redfaced and pounded his fist on a table the cia is not a rogue organization , he declared relations worsened when senators accused the cia of penetrating a computer network designated for the committee s use and reading staff emails to find out how the committee might have obtained an internal cia study of interrogations ordered by mr panetta when he was director the cia inspector general admonished five agency officers and mr brennan apologized , but relations remained raw senator carl levin , a michigan democrat on the committee , said on saturday that he had yet to receive answers about mr brennan s exact role in the episode to stonewall about getting information about what he knew and when he knew it is really unacceptable , he said brennan has gotten away with frustrating congressional oversight he should n't have gotten away with it , but so far he has several obama advisers said privately that mr brennan made a mistake by letting the situation grow so toxic in october , mr mcdonough flew to california to smooth things over with senator dianne feinstein of california , the committee chairwoman , and negotiate redactions to the torture report last week mr brennan became the agency s prime defender , much to the chagrin of some of the president s allies there s a difference between loyalty and leadership , said elisa massimino , president of human rights first , an advocacy group brennan may be showing loyalty to the agency by trying to make sure none of his people are in legal peril leadership would be if he used this crisis as an opportunity to make clear what the standards are going forward as for mr obama , advisers said they doubted he believed the interrogation program yielded useful intelligence but that he was unwilling to publicly contradict mr brennan instead , the president made sure the cia got what it needed cover against its critics michael v hayden , the former cia director who has led the public defense against the senate report , said he deeply appreciated mr obama s measured words about the tough choices his predecessor faced after sept 11 and his praise for the patriots of the cia given what he s said in the past , mr hayden said , this is about the best we could have hoped for
melbourne , australia one court on saturday at the australian open provided a window into the future of men s tennis , the possibilities and pitfalls on display here was grigor dimitrov , the bulgarian once cast as the next , for years known as baby fed , with that smooth onehanded backhand , now dating maria sharapova his opponent \? milos raonic , the canadian with a serve as big as his 6foot5 frame raonic is 23 years old , dimitrov 22 both are considered potential superstars , capable in the nottoodistant future of breaking apart the stranglehold four players have held on men s tennis for the better part of nine seasons , especially at grand slam tournaments they are , of course , rafael nadal , novak djokovic , andy murray and federer \( all four have advanced to the fourth round here \) dimitrov and raonic could join them at the top , could sprinkle some variety into a sport in which four men have stood so far above the remainder of the field for so long or they could never fulfill such promise , he went from future star to the challenger circuit , from junior championships to a 17match losing streak that is the thing about the next era of men s tennis there are no certain bets with the big four , we 've skipped , like , two generations almost , said brad gilbert , the espn analyst now more than ever , we need an infusion of youth it s very rare what s happened over the last 10 years he was asked for a comparable period , a similar sustained run he thought for a second there is none , he said young , like raonic and dimitrov , also played at margaret court arena on saturday his three wins this season before saturday had exceeded his 2013 total in atp world tour main draws he appeared to be on another upswing , as he was at the in 2011 , before everything fell apart again dimitrov can understand the weight of expectations he is that talented he hit perhaps the shot of the tournament in a fourthset tiebreaker against raonic , a sublime onehanded backhand struck on the run that nicked the outside of the sideline dimitrov won junior titles at wimbledon and the united states open and ascended to no 1 in the juniors he preferred pink tennis shoes , his game marked by flamboyance yet he had not fought into the second week of a grand slam tournament until saturday , when he dropped raonic in what could become an eradefining rivalry ,  in victory , dimitrov again credited roger rasheed , an australian who worked previously with lleyton hewitt , ga l monfils and jowilfried tsonga according to the age of melbourne , rasheed told dimitrov to drop the pink he had baby fed removed from dimitrov s official biography sure , dimitrov resembled federer in style , the graceful movement , the backhand , but he wanted to be different someone asked him saturday about all the pressure , all that weight they play in my head some , dimitrov said , and by they he meant the expectations it s not easy of course , everybody would talk everybody would say whatever it s tough to have that pressure on your shoulders dimitrov later took another question about baby fed , which seemed to annoy him the reporter wanted to know if he felt that the nickname had been permanently shelved he noted that the reporter had seconds ago referred to him that way he said he had been clear my name is grigor , he said dimitrov dictated the pace against raonic , but raonic stayed close behind a serve that sounded like a gunshot when delivered whenever dimitrov could extend a rally beyond 10 or so shots , he had to feel good about his chances then , inevitably , came another serve , boomed wide or down the middle or at the body raonic , seeded 11th , grew up in brampton , ontario , practicing outside , at night , in temperatures better suited for an icebox he studied videotapes of pete sampras and trained all over canada and reached a careerhigh rank of no 10 last august with that serve , with that ranking , raonic became a popular contender for the next , next era of men s tennis he also teamed with a new coach , ivan ljubicic their stated goal advance deeper into grand slam events their latest setback saturday upon arrival for this tournament , raonic told reporters he had visited a local aquarium and had swum with sharks as the globe and mail of toronto noted , he will find a parallel in the upper realm of the men s tour that is the thing about the next era of men s tennis the last era , the current era , will not end the big four have won 34 combined singles titles in the last 35 grand slam tournaments only juan mart n del potro interrupted their streak , with a triumph at the united states open in 2009 at 25 , he is the youngest player in the top 10 , but even his story is somewhat cautionary , his career fraught with injuries since that open he lost here in the second round , the biggest upset of the first week of the tournament federer is 32 , but nadal is only 27 , murray and djokovic both 26 despite some hiccups federer recently switched rackets and coaches murray had back surgery nadal missed much of early 2013 with injuries their era shows few signs of ending anytime soon then there is young , part of the next era of men s tennis before his results led to a revocation of his membership card he turned professional at 14 and signed a nike contract at 15 but that never really translated , and for years he was forced to defend his practice habits and his choice of coaches \( his mother \) in 2012 , he lost 17 straight matches , and yet there are always flashes that remind the tennis world of his prodigious talent saturday was the perfect example young wore a bright lime green shirt on court against kei nishikori of japan , once young s contemporary , now the no 16 seed young swung to an early lead he attacked the net , volleyed with abandon , looped forehands for winners down the line he led , 52 , in the first set he lost five games the crowd , filled with flags from japan , rowdy from the outset , cheered loudly enough to be scolded multiple times by the chair umpire the arena was as festive as young s shirt nishikori won all but one game the rest of the match young met with reporters after he received treatment for a strained pectoral muscle he calmly , politely , answered all the usual questions he grew up playing with nishikori and raonic , slightly older than dimitrov he said their generation was definitely getting closer to the top he was asked if he felt burdened as the last american men s singles player left here he did not i had that for a while when i was younger , and it did n't work well , young said that is the thing about the next era of men s tennis the search continues
for those concerned about eating and health , the glass was more than half full last week some activists were actually exuberant first , there was that obesity rates among preschool children had then michelle obama announced plans to further in public schools finally , the food and drug administration s proposed revision of the nutrition label that appears on \( literally , incredibly \) something like 700 , 000 packaged foods \( many of which only pretend to be foods \) the new label will include a line for added sugars and makes other important changes , too if the 43 percent plunge in obesity in young children holds true , it s fantastic news , a tribute to the improved special supplemental nutrition program for women , infants and children \( wic \) , which encourages the consumption of fruits and vegetables to improved nutrition guidelines to a slight reduction in the marketing of junk to children and probably to the encouragement of breastfeeding practically everyone in this country who speaks english or spanish has heard or read the message that junk food is bad for you , and that mostly determine eating habits for a lifetime none of this happened by accident , and the lesson is that policy works the further limitations on marketing junk are more complicated essentially , producers wo n't be able to promote what they already ca n't sell \( per new department of agriculture regulations \) , meaning that vending machines or scoreboards cannot encourage the consumption of sugarsweetened beverages \( promotion of would be allowed \) mrs obama s tendency to see the reformulation of packaged foods as an important goal is on display here snacks sold in schools \( both in vending machines and out \) will have to meet one of four requirements , like containing at least 50 percent whole grain or a quartercup of fruits or vegetables these proposed rules are better than nothing but filled with loopholes manufacturers will quickly figure out how to meet the new standards , and the improvements , though not insignificant , will not go far in teaching kids that the best snack is an apple or a handful of nuts \( one way to really clobber junk food would be to prevent companies from taking tax deductions on the marketing of unhealthy foods , a move that s of connecticut \) still it beats calling ketchup a vegetable the label change is huge yes it could be hugeer yes it s long overdue yes it may be fought by industry and wo n't be in place for a long time and yes the real key is to be eating whole foods that do n't need to be labeled but by including added sugars on the label , the fda is siding with those who recognize that this is an acknowledgment by the agency that sugar is a big problem , says the former fda commissioner david kessler , who presided over the development of the last label change , 20 years ago it will allow the next generation to grow up with far more awareness big food has long maintained that it does n't matter where sugar or indeed calories come from that they 're all the same but added sugars declares the industry s strategy of pumping up the volume on palatability , making ketchup , yogurt and granola bars , for example , as sweet and highcalorie as jam , ice cream and snickers added sugar turns sparkling water into soda and foodlike objects into candy added sugar , if you can forgive the hyperbole , is the enemy this is not to say you should n't eat a granola bar , but if you know what s in it you 're less likely to think of it as health food there are a couple of other significant changes , including \( a serving of ice cream will now be a more realistic cup instead of a halfcup , for example \) , the deletion of the calories from fat line , which recognizes that not all fats are bad , and some changes in daily recommended values for various nutrients mrs obama , who is sometimes seen \( by me among many others \) as overly industryfriendly , was behind the push for these changes , or at least highly supportive of them and she deserves credit it s a victory , and no one on the progressive side of this struggle should see it as otherwise the label is hardly messianic in fact , the fda tacitly acknowledges this by offering , which approaches the kind of traffic light labeling i 've advocated for , and which to support the alternative has four sections , including avoid too much and get enough the first includes added sugars and trans fat , for example , and the second , fiber and vitamin d michael taylor , the fda s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine and the guy who supervised the new label s development told me that the alternative label is essentially a way to further stimulate comments it may be that it s also a demonstration of the agency s will , designed to show industry how threatening things could get so big food will swallow the primary label without much complaint although the ultimate decision is the fda s , the grocery manufacturers' association statement last week , it is critical that any changes are based on the most current and reliable science these are , and marketers are going to have a tough time claiming otherwise in other words , we 're going to see some form of new and stronger label , period introducing the label , mrs obama said , our guiding principle here is very simple that you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store , pick up an item off the shelf , and be able to tell whether it s good for your family this label moves in that direction , but it could be much more powerful kessler would like to see a pie chart on the front of the package that would help people know what s real food and what s not michael pollan also suggests frontofthebox labeling i think the uk has the right idea with on the front of packages only a small percentage of shoppers get to the nutritional panel on the back and the nyu nutrition professor marion nestle \( who called this label change courageous \) says that a recommended upper limit for added sugars would help put them in context i 'd like to see that set at 10 percent of calories or 50 grams \( 200 calories \) in a 2 , 000calorie diet \( i wrote about my own , which includes categories that probably wo n't be considered for another 10 years if ever back in 2012 \) what else is wrong \? the label covers a lot of food , but it has no effect on restaurant food , takeout , most prepared food sold in bulk \( do you have any idea what s in that fried chicken at the supermarket deli counter , for example \? \) or alcohol the obama administration and the fda have made a couple of moves here that might be categorized as bold , but they could have done so three or four years ago these are regulations that can be built upon , and do not require congressional approval but by the time they 're in effect it may be too late for this administration to take them to the next level in short , it s not a case of toolittletoolate but one of it could 've been more and happened sooner but that s looking backward instead of forward if we see a decline in obesity rates , more curbs on food marketing and greater transparency in packaged food , that s progress let s be thankful for it , then get back to work pushing for more

sometimes the voice of an era is the one that you forget all about , the one that was so ubiquitous and inoffensive , it practically became background noise in the 1990s , that distinction likely belonged to adam duritz , a jangly , scattered vocalist with a hobo s air his band , counting crows , had a seventimes platinum debut in 1993 , august and everything after in clear defiance of grunge s ascent , and continued releasing platinum albums through the decade in the 2000s , that role may have fallen to adam levine , an utterly gritless singer whose band , maroon 5 , amounted to not much more than an average of every white soul band before it its 2002 debut , songs about jane , went five times platinum , and the band s subsequent albums have never dipped below the million mark mainstream rock is the least ruthless of all genres , less encouraging of innovation than even mainstream country that means these bands thrived not only in their own eras , but also continue apace both have new albums this week counting crows' somewhere under wonderland \( capitol \) and maroon 5 s v \( interscope \) two warm hugs from bands that have never asked much of their listeners both albums are so neutral and linetoeing that they could be mistaken for greatest hits packages , or unreleased demos almost nothing marks them as being of the present moment even compared with the mainstream rock of each band s prime years , both counting crows and maroon 5 were conservative counting crows was a spacey rootsrock band that never much bothered with anguish in a time when rock s most lauded vocalists were the most bruised , mr duritz was dippy and whimsical , a clear escapist maroon 5 evolved out of kara s flowers , for which the 1990s were just a little too intense and demanding it reemerged as a pristine and toothless litesoul band buoyed only by the mediumstrength falsetto of mr levine as rock lost its luster and purpose , and hiphop and rb were in ascent , maroon 5 offered a solution for those who felt left behind a funksoul outfit in the guise of a rock band not much has changed on v , which is full of songs that have been ironed flat of any real sentiment the gleam of mr levine s voice is paramount , whether its singing about desperate passion or romantic skepticism he could n't sound lecherous if he tried , which he does on sugar , insisting , i want that red velvet , i want that sugar sweet he croons so cleanly it s possible to imagine that he is truly singing about cake v is like a peppy new nissan altima it wo n't give you too many problems it wo n't attract stares it probably wo n't get stolen its parts are reliable , though none have the pulse of the 2011 hit that gave this group new life maps , the lead single , employs this summer s signature tactic of aping the police to be fair , maroon 5 has been working a version of this for years , but it s tempting to say that nico vinz do it better on and that magic ! on does it more shamelessly the flickers of innovation here are brief , and only mildly derailing the synthpop intro on it was always you , or the genesis drums on coming back for you , which also includes an extra heap of vocal processing that gesture is the album s most disturbing , because in making mr levine s voice something other than wholly familiar , it robs this band of the one thing it has going for it comfort the core of mr levine s voice is inoffensiveness for mr duritz , it s awshucks wonder counting crows has always been a band for wouldbe dreamers who are content to let mr duritz do the adventuring for them somewhere under wonderland teems with lyrics full of rambling travelogue and mystical gobbledygook mr duritz sings them confidently , in a voice that s not as laden with meaning as he seems to think , and preserving his shambolic nature occasionally he appears to turn inward what is the price for all this fame and selfabsorption \? he sings on earthquake driver , continuing , we turn ourselves into orphans and then spend our nights alone living in fear of some imaginary consequence but more often , he revels in overdetailed narrative that does n't hold up to scrutiny , as in she was married alive in a moscow surgery hoping to die in a cold war nursery behind him , the band is optimistic and indifferent , shuffling through easy rootsrock cut through with heavy doses of hornsbyesque piano \( while we 're here , toad the wet sprocket recently released a notbad album , new constellation \) yet , for all of counting crows s strategic dullness , it s capable of actual elegance , as on possibility days , a slow walk of a song on which mr duritz s wimpy whine sounds like real hurt but that song is the outlier a resistance to feeling too deeply unites these two bands and has kept them afloat as others around them rose higher and crashed lower neutrality has served them well both mr levine and mr duritz have been noted squires to celebrities and models , and they continue to have careers well past their natural expiration dates that said , underscoring that these bands are out of fashion only misses the point they were never in fashion to begin with
the th tre royal de la monnaie in brussels was having a good year philippe boesmans s new opera , based on a play about a dysfunctional family by jo l pommerat , scored a hit in march romeo castellucci s radical production of gluck s , in which a euridice double lies comatose in a hospital bed , intrigued audiences while incensing some critics in june a new production of strauss s by guy joosten opened the current season in september with sally matthews heading a strong cast then two things , both unexpected and both potentially threatening , happened to the theater , which is one of europe s best run and most innovative opera companies first , the new belgian federal coalition government announced , within days of its formation in october , deep funding cuts as part of an effort to balance the budget as proposed , the cuts would have required the monnaie to trim personnel expenses by 4 percent and operating expenses by 20 percent as of jan 1 , 2015 , with further cuts in operating expenses at the rate of 2 percent a year through 2019 the belgian newspaper le soir reported the government s decision under the headline the murder of federal culture that the cuts came without warning and with little time to implement them was especially irksome to the monnaie s general and artistic director , peter de caluwe reached by telephone this month a day after the theater s latest premiere , a production of mozart s don giovanni by the polish director krzysztof warlikowski , mr de caluwe criticized the inelegant and undiplomatic way the cuts were announced , but added that it was the substance that really hurt then , on dec 12 , another shoe fell the french conductor ludovic morlot , chief conductor of the monnaie since 2012 , announced his departure effective at the end of the year in a statement , mr morlot , 40 , who is also music director of the seattle symphony , said , i feel that the orchestra and i have not managed to reach a consensus on an artistic vision , and therefore , for the sake of their development as well as my own , i have made this decision to stand down in this season of abrupt resignations by major conductors from european opera houses from the vienna state opera , from the rome opera and others from italy mr morlot s departure from the monnaie deprives the theater of a rising talent and necessitates a search for replacements for his scheduled engagements while he will conduct the remaining performances of \( through dec 30 \) he was also scheduled to conduct pascal dusapin s penthesilea in march and april although i very much regret this situation , i respect ludovic morlot s decision to make this radical change to his future plans , mr de caluwe said in a statement mr morlot , for his part , said he was deeply grateful to have had the opportunity to be part of such a vibrant , challenging and creative institution the monnaie \( de munt in dutch \) is one of only three cultural institutions under the control of the belgian federal government the others are the national orchestra and the center for fine arts other institutions fall under the domain of either the dutchspeaking region in the north or the frenchspeaking region in the south as measured against its annual budget of 475 million euros , or 59 million , the theater puts on a significant number of highquality performances this season it will give 90 performances of 10 staged operas , two of them in a sign of the theater s commitment to new works world premieres shell shock by nicholas lens , with a libretto by the singer and poet nick cave , and penthesilea six other productions are new or new to the theater for 2015 the annual budget will be 445 million the monnaie has already experienced enforced belttightening since the economic downturn began in 2008 taking into account cuts made during the previous five years , we will experience a reduction of 30 percent in the space of 10 years , mr de caluwe said it s as if we 're being punished again the theater has already reduced personnel by 15 percent , he said , and those who remain have been extraordinarily understanding in accepting wage freezes the monnaie has a wellearned reputation for teamwork , musical excellence and theatrical boldness few other major operas houses , and probably none outside germany , can match the monnaie s cuttingedge production style the theater s reputation for excellence traces back to the 1980s , when the late g rard mortier ran the theater among the many world premieres during his regime was that of john adams s in 1991 after mortier departed the following year to become artistic director of the salzburg festival , standards were kept high by his successor , bernard foccroulle mr de caluwe , 51 , succeeded mr foccroulle in 2007 breaking the mold is in the theater s dna founded in 1700 on the site of what was the national mint , the theater was , in 1830 , the site of one of the most consequential performances in opera history auber s la muette de portici , about a neapolitan fisherman who led a revolt against the spanish viceroy , set off riots that precipitated the revolution of that year nowadays , the theater s capacity to incite comes principally from the boldness of its directors , with the new don giovanni as a case in point reportedly influenced by , steve mcqueen s film about a sex addict , the production is apparently so explicit that the theater s website warns that it is not intended for those under 16 the cheers at final curtain at the opening were mixed with boos , though reviews praised mr morlot s performance it was not really a scandal and went down quite well , mr de caluwe said if you modernize it , people will see in don giovanni a figure they can recognize he is so sexually dependent it is killing him , and in our society we have to deal with this monnaie audiences apparently understand all 13 performances are sold out directors at the monnaie are routinely allowed to follow their vision productions by mr warlikowski , who has also staged verdi s macbeth , cherubini s m d e and berg s lulu at the theater , generally allow an opera s story to unfold recognizably , albeit amidst trappings that may seem tangential stefan herheim , who staged dvorak s rusalka , is apt to have the action play out in a parallel world , mr de caluwe said an especially memorable recent revival of a rarity was meyerbeer s les huguenots staged by olivier py and conducted by marc minkowski , who was also the conductor for dmitri tcherniakov s intriguingly intimate take on verdi s il trovatore in addition to orfeo , the theater gave a boost to mr castellucci s opera career with wagner s parsifal , conducted by hartmut haenchen , which also drew strong reactions , both positive and negative the theater itself is a neoclassical building completed in 1819 with an auditorium rebuilt in an eclectic french and italian style following a fire in 1855 it lacks modern features such as multiple stages we will always be a 19thcentury theater , mr de caluwe said occasionally , the limitations will work against a given work , but usually we can be creative in different ways the theater has not shied away from wagner s ring cycle , which was seen in a memorable production by herbert wernicke using a single set with just 1 , 150 seats , la monnaie s intimacy is a boon to its audience but a constraint on ticket revenues currently , 345 million of the theater s budget comes from the federal government \( amounts from the city are negligible \) , a figure that will be reduced to 332 million next year , with other amounts coming from ticket sales \( 69 million \) , sponsors and fundraising \( 23 million \) and income from coproductions and rentals \( 2 million \) the amount of next year s subsidy reflects an element of good news responding to the popular outcry , the government decided to exempt cultural institutions from the acrosstheboard reductions applicable to all administrative institutions the cuts at the monnaie have therefore become slightly milder , mr de caluwe said also helpful is that expenditures made specifically for artistic purposes are not included in operating expenses much about the theater s financial future and the implementation of cuts remains undecided but on dec 16 the theater announced preliminary measures it expects to take these include eliminating 16 jobs , replacing a fully staged production scheduled for december with a semistaged one , reducing its dance productions to one per year and canceling several concerts educational programs will remain in place the reduction in dance further distances the theater from a tradition there to which maurice b jart and mark morris made important contributions an opportunity would seem to exist for increasing contributions from sponsors and individuals , but mr de caluwe fears that not enough can be raised to bridge the gap , in part because europe remains slow to recover from the financial downturn besides , he adds , a culture of giving is not in our genes , and tax laws do n't encourage it one potential bright spot is a possible merger of the monnaie s orchestra with the national orchestra because 27 percent of the players of the two orchestras will soon be eligible for pensions , mr de caluwe said , we could have an orchestra of 130 without firing people in any case , he acknowledged that the theater would have to do more with less but we will also be forced to produce less , he said
upsets have been somewhat commonplace in this ncaa tournament of the 32 games thursday and friday , eight were won by a lower seed maybe the seedings were wrong in the first place coach bob hoffman of 14thseeded mercer , which , said he believed the rating percentage index , a ranking system based on factors such as strength of schedule , gave too much weight to lesser teams in power conferences and not enough weight to strong teams in smaller conferences you do n't want to get me started , hoffman said saturday i would tell you what i think about the rpi i do n't know how you decide , but to me , that s a flawed instrument no mercer team had won an ncaa tournament game before friday mercer had not even qualified for the tournament since 1985 bears forward jakob gollon waited six years and played in 152 games before reaching the tournament for the first time he had foot operations and a knee operation , leading him to redshirt two seasons mercer , a small liberal arts university in macon , ga , with an arena that seats just 3 , 500 , will face 11thseeded tennessee on sunday in raleigh , nc , with a chance to reach the round of 16 gollon and the six other seniors on mercer s roster are accustomed to playing in tough , tight road games against teams from major conferences hoffman has set up mercer s schedule that way for years this season , the bears' nonconference schedule included games against texas and oklahoma i think it was one of the most important factors for our win yesterday , hoffman said , adding , and the confidence in each other grows , and the confidence in yourself to be in that moment and know that you 're as good as those folks , even though maybe they did n't recruit you but that you can play if there was any question before mercer s game against duke whether the bears could win , there is little doubt that they can handle the volunteers when the teams met a year ago at tennessee in the first round of the national invitation tournament , mercer won , 7567 the day after his season ended with a broken foot , iowa state swingman georges niang seemed to embrace his new role joking , he said he had taken a quick field trip to get some cardinal and gold pompoms instead of flaunting his hook shot or pouring in 3pointers , niang , who was injured during the second half of of the tournament , against north carolina central on friday night , will be the cyclones' tallest cheerleader sunday georges is an irreplaceable player , guard naz long said we can all just be honest and say that how to replace the irreplaceable , then the thirdseeded cyclones are expected to make long a starter for their east region game against sixthseeded north carolina , creating a threeguard lineup with no one taller than 6 feet 6 inches the timing of the injury to niang , who is 67 and played everywhere on the court , is particularly inconvenient given the tar heels' size and athleticism , a combination that iowa state players said they had faced only a few times this season to put that whole package together is something we have n't seen all year , iowa state coach fred hoiberg said so to put together a game plan when you lose arguably your most important player in 48 hours is tough , but we 'll do the best job we can throughout the season , iowa state has overcome a height disadvantage with what forward melvin ejim called gang rebounding , and it will be imperative that iowa state s guards , like 64 deandre kane , box out north carolina coach roy williams suggested that a smaller , quicker lineup could pose problems for his team you do n't know if they 're sitting over there saying , north carolina , boy , they rebounded it really well we better play a big guy , ' williams said or are they saying , the heck with the big guy let s put our best five basketball players on the court' you know , my guess is that they would do that , but it is a guess williams and some of his players can empathize with losing such a pivotal player during the ncaa tournament they experienced it in 2012 when kendall marshall , the tar heels' starting point guard at the time , fractured his wrist in the team s second game north carolina won once without him , against upstart ohio , before falling to kansas the cyclones said it was an emotional scene when they learned late friday that niang would be unavailable the rest of the tournament but they , like niang , were in good spirits saturday this is just a little bump in the road , niang said we can handle anything that comes our way that s just how tough we are the sophomores tony parker , who grew up in atlanta , and kyle anderson , a new jersey guy , had a los angeles moment last week , but it did not involve an actor or a rock star they awoke monday to their first earthquake , a 44magnitude temblor whose epicenter was in westwood , calif , where they share an apartment i thought we were being robbed , said parker , who at 69 and a robust 255 pounds would appear to have little to fear my door was shaking i looked around to get a baseball bat then the glass in my shower started shaking , and i knew it was an earthquake he added we do n't have those in georgia we have thunderstorms that you know are coming three weeks ahead of time parker said that as soon as the shaking stopped , he called his mother it was fun because i got to experience it , he said do i want to do it again \? no i hope it s my first and final earthquake the stanfordkansas game in st louis on sunday is set to begin at 11 15 am local time 9 15 am in california so the cardinal s players might be ready to dig in to breakfast around game time but coach johnny dawkins was trying to put a good spin on the schedule the toughest thing for any player is the waiting game all day , just waiting to play , dawkins said i would rather wake up let s go warm up , and let s go play wichita state coach gregg marshall was asked if he thought his veteran team would have an advantage against kentucky s lineup of five freshmen , each of whom was an elite , nationally known recruit with those kentucky freshmen , i do n't think confidence is an issue , marshall said and it never has been one of those freshmen , point guard andrew harrison , injured his right elbow in kentucky s victory over kansas state on friday night , and it was uncertain if he would play on sunday we really do n't know how bad the elbow is going to be , kentucky coach john calipari said , adding that harrison s twin , aaron , might play point guard instead andrew is young , and we 've still got some time but what if he s only 70 percent and i say we ca n't win with a guy who is 70 percent \? we 'll have to see how it plays out the arizonagonzaga game sunday will be a study in contrasts the bulldogs' silky ball movement against the wildcats' ironfisted defense one matchup will be worth watching , too , as a study in linguistics at center , 7foot kaleb tarczewski of arizona will go up against 7foot1 przemek karnowski of gonzaga scrabble , anyone \? both centers are of polish heritage karnowski , who grew up in the central polish city torun , caught the eye of gonzaga s coaches at the 2009 17andunder world championships \( the coaches were in attendance to watch kevin pangos of the united states , now a gonzaga guard \) tarczewski is a native of claremont , nh , three generations removed from poland it s kind of cool being able to play against somebody from poland , tarczewski said , although he acknowledged that his polish heritage felt distant his name , which he said should properly be pronounced tarshefski , is pronounced tarzooski he does not speak any polish \( and took german in high school \) as for a polish delicacy \? i love pirogies , he said but i eat them from the store karnowski sounded intrigued he misses his grandmother s pirogi , filled with strawberries , and was unaware that a grocery store might carry them he beamed when he saw a polish flag in the crowd during gonzaga s win over oklahoma state on friday , and he said he was pleased to receive a notice on facebook of a polishspeaking group in spokane , wash but karnowski is also making an effort to assimilate he accepted an apology from the broadcaster andrew catalon , who used a slur when describing the cowboys' strategy to foul karnowski karnowski said saturday that it was not a big deal , and he laughed as he said that he long ago gave up on his teammates' correctly pronouncing his first name he happily answers to shimmick as for spelling it \? both karnowski and tarczewski assumed none of their teammates would be able to correctly spell their names my mom used to joke around , tarczewski said if you could spell your last name , you could recite the alphabet
baghdad a senior iraqi official on friday warned that his country might be forced to turn to iran for military help if none were forthcoming from the united states , but he insisted he was unaware of any iranian military units in his country so far the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to make statements to the media , was severely critical of the obama administration for its handling of the iraq crisis , and for failing , in his view , to better prepare the country s military for an emergency if you 're in an antique shop there s a sign , if you broke it , you bought it , ' the official , who is an adviser to prime minister nuri kamal almaliki , said i am not saying the americans are responsible for everything , but they did not leave a welltrained army and they left us without any real air support , and the obama administration really shares much of the blame american military and intelligence officials have painted a sharply different picture , saying the iraqi military collapse reflected poor leadership , declining troop morale and broken equipment , subverting a 25 billion effort by the united states to train and equip iraq s security forces cnn reported on friday , quoting an unidentified iraqi security source in baghdad , that 500 iranian revolutionary guards in three units deployed into iraq in recent days , but there was no independent confirmation of that the maliki adviser said that the iraqi government wanted air support and intelligence sharing in particular from the united states so far , the adviser said , he was not aware of any direct iranian role in iraq , nor the presence of any iranian units on iraqi territory what changes this is if the us does not help , iran will come in and this is really dangerous , he said if they do n't help i do n't think iran will let the iraqi government collapse , they will fight and fight very hard the adviser said that the iraqi government was not to blame alone for the success of the islamic state of iraq and syria s advance through the north of the country he blamed turkey , because it was angry over iraqi support for the regime of president bashar alassad of syria , and the kurds , who wanted to profit from iraqi weakness in the north , which on thursday helped them to take kirkuk , an oil rich prize long shared between the arabs and the kurds in an uneasy truce so yes there are cases where the iraqi army disappeared but you have to take the locality in context , the advisersaid the 2nd division of the iraqi army is 80 percent kurds and 20 percent locals , the kurds withdrew to the kurdish areas and this started a panic turkey wanted to unseat bashar al assad and now they see the iraqis helping him and this is payback , the senior official said this is part of that , i really believe that but he said that the iraqi government , while concerned about developments , was not concerned about its survival , nor about the safety of the capital while the sunni militants have headed south after capturing mosul , tikrit and some other places , he said , i do n't think they have the capability to come the rest of the way while mr maliki failed to win support in his parliament for the declaration of a state of emergency , because sunni and kurdish lawmakers boycotted the session and prevented the required quorum , the official said that was not a vital concern in the security situation the prime minister has total control of the security forces the most important thing now is that the army has to stand up and fight and prove itself just how serious some of the setbacks were for the iraqi military was underscored by a that surfaced on thursday of 600 prisoners being marched single file outside of tikrit , under guard of what appeared to be blackclad militants with the islamic state of iraq and syria , also known as isis the video was attributed to the jihadi group , although its authenticity could not be verified the captives were described as shiite soldiers such news was partly counterbalanced by reports that two towns taken over by the militants on thursday , sadiyah and jalawlaa , as well as parts of muqdadiyah , were retaken by the iraqi army working with kurdish militiamen , the pesh merga , on friday muqdadiyah , 55 miles north of baghdad , represented the closest the militant advance had come to baghdad the isis advance appeared to have stopped at least for a day outside samarra , a town important to shiites for the religious shrine there an set off widespread sectarian warfare at the balad air base north of baghdad , the country s largest air force base , hundreds of american contractors were in the process of being evacuated friday , in an operation that began thursday , according to iraqi news reports the contractors were training iraqi crews to maintain and operate f16 fighter jets and helicopters lockheed confirmed that 25 american trainers had been evacuated from the base , which is close to the areas north of baghdad where the isis militants have advanced
when america sends men and women to fight , it owes them an enduring debt , starting with competent and timely health care and disability benefits when they leave active duty president obama at recent charges of wrongdoing in the department of veterans affairs' health care system he also dispatched his deputy chief of staff to phoenix to assess explosive allegations that government workers falsified data to hide long wait times for veterans needing to see doctors but expressing outrage is hardly enough for a president who , as a candidate in 2008 , criticized the agency and vowed to improve care and address backlogs it is past time for a more visible personal commitment to right these wrongs as well as strong white house support for legislation that would make it possible for top agency officials to fire those responsible for wrongdoing the allegations that veterans' hospitals around the country manipulated data or created secret waiting lists to hide long delays are disgraceful those concerns initially focused on veterans' medical facilities in phoenix , but now involve in several states , including colorado , texas and wyoming the acting inspector general of veterans affairs , is now working with federal prosecutors to determine if criminal acts occurred in phoenix there have been allegations that as many as 40 veterans may have died while awaiting care and that the delays may have contributed to their deaths none of the charges have been verified mr griffin s report is expected in august the department runs the largest health care group in the country , overseeing 1 , 700 hospitals , clinics , nursing homes and other facilities critics say it is an entrenched , sclerotic bureaucracy that suffers from a lack of innovation and a structure in which the health care and disability divisions are often working at cross purposes those problems have been compounded by the flow of service members returning from wars in iraq and afghanistan as well as policy changes affecting victims of agent orange , which brought thousands more veterans into the system nevertheless , the buck stops with mr obama , who pledged to build a 21stcentury va the white house says that while participation in the veterans' health system has jumped 16 percent since 2008 , the huge backlog of cases has , in fact , been reduced even so , mr obama s republican adversaries now have fresh ammunition to use in questioning his management skills , and even some democrats , such as senator richard blumenthal , a democrat of connecticut , have declared themselves fed up and impatient the first order of business is to obtain a clear understanding of what happened in phoenix and other facilities although three senior officials in phoenix were put on administrative leave , and two top health officials at the agency have resigned , there is still much that is unclear about not only the problems in phoenix but the rest of the system mr griffin s report should thus be accelerated some veterans groups and republicans who sense another campaign issue are now calling for the resignation of eric shinseki , the former general who has led the veterans affairs department for five years mr shinseki s future will depend heavily on whether he can respond to this crisis with decisive action
the system , like any other gargantuan department of government , has mountains of public records available eventually to anyone who asks seekers of data from reporters to members of the board of regents to curious texans ask for all types of information , including contracts , transcripts of prospective employees , lists of people interviewed for coaching positions and so on ut s website even has a link to a database of requests made under the state s open information act , where it lists who made the request , when it was made and a description of what was being sought it does not , however , include the actual public records that those requesters asked for to get that , you must file your own request , creating a trail that allows the rest of us to see what you were seeking and ut has to fulfill your order , repeating some or all of the work it did for the first requester that other trail , which would have made your second request unnecessary , is not there the records themselves remain , for now , behind the moat it is tantalizingly close to real transparency , available to anyone who can get online and poke around this is not entirely fair to ut the system is getting picked on here because it offers a halfanswer online , where most government agencies offer none they are showing the requests to all comers much more than their counterparts are showing but as the song reminds us , you ca n't always get what you want it does n't seem to matter who you are , either regent wallace hall is sitting in the middle of a hot skillet right now in part because of his requests for public information he asked the university of texas at austin to assemble some records for him his antagonists say he was also trying to micromanage that school and for that and related reasons , he s the subject of a legislative impeachment inquiry \( the university of texas at austin is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune \) the system s database is a gold mine for the curious in december , someone asked how much it cost ut to fight the actor ryan o'neal over an andy warhol picture of farrah fawcett in october , a requester sought aggregate act scores in reading and english and the aggregate sat reading and writing scores for student athletes participating in football and basketball it can be useful to see what others are after reporters do it , trying to catch up with their competitors political opposition researchers do it so do business researchers who want to know what others are seeking from regulators and licensing agencies and so on posting what people are requesting only whets the appetite for more just think if the answers were online , too the schools could avoid extra work while providing real transparency into the records that are supposed to be in public view anyhow last march , state senator judith zaffirini , democrat of laredo , asked ut for all emails , correspondence , documents , and any other records related to conversations , documents , interactions , meetings , reports , or exchanges about ut president bill powers that included any member of the ut board of regents we know that because ut put it online just think if the answer went online for everyone else as soon at the senator got it she and mr hall were after some of the same records , after all it sparks the imagination what if other government agencies put this type of information out there , allowing everyone to see what they held in their file cabinets , what they deemed secret , what they redacted and did not redact , what other requesters have coaxed them to reveal ut started its open records database at the system level in april 2012 and extended it to the individual campuses less than a year later the idea of including the full records is something that s under consideration , according to a spokeswoman , jenny lacostecaputo it makes some sense , once it has been pulled , to leave it out for others , so long as that does n't create undue burdens on ut , she said someday , it might all be online for that , you can thank the regent who suggested it his name is wallace hall
anaheim , calif starter adjusted his cap , fiddled with his belt and kicked the dirt as the ' raul ibanez rounded the bases the fans at angel stadium were on their feet , cheering in a stretch of seven pitches in the bottom of the first inning on sunday , three angels connected for solo home runs mike trout , albert pujols and ibanez it was as if colon were pitching batting practice the angels tacked on another run in the inning and roughed up colon for eight extrabase hits , including four homers , and nine runs in five innings in a mets loss the mets were coming off backtoback series wins , against the cincinnati reds and the atlanta braves , behind good pitching and just enough hitting this was the rubber game against the angels , their chance to win a third straight series and get back to 500 but the immediate and swift collapse of colon seemed to take the life out of the mets , and by the later innings , the mets' emotions were running high david wright and daniel murphy were ejected in the seventh , apparently for yelling at an umpire from the dugout with one out in the first , trout worked the count full before blasting a fastball over the centerfield wall two pitches later , pujols crushed the ball to left field and four pitches after that , ibanez sent one to right kole calhoun doubled on colon s next pitch , and he scored on a twoout double by ian stewart just like that , the angels led , 41 manager terry collins joked that he needed colon to go 11 innings sunday , with the mets having exhausted their bullpen the two previous nights the team , which had arrived here from atlanta around 3 am friday , lost in 11 innings that night and won in 13 innings saturday night in general , the mets were tired colon settled down for two innings , but he was knocked around again in the fourth , walking stewart and then allowing four straight hits it did not help that a diving eric young jr missed a fly ball by erick aybar , which went for a tworun triple aybar then scored on a single by j b shuck , and in the fifth , hank conger smacked a slider for a tworun homer that gave the angels a 92 lead a disturbing trend is developing for colon in three starts , he has allowed six home runs after allowing 14 in 30 starts last season he has built his reputation on fastball command , and the angels crushed the pitch the last time colon had allowed nine earned runs a career high was 2007 that s just not him , collins said , adding he lives and dies with location if he makes mistakes up in the zone , he gets hit and today , he was up the lead proved to be plenty for c j wilson his biggest mistake came in the first inning , when he walked young , who went to second as murphy grounded out young scored on a single by wright it was the third time in four games that young had scored in the first inning the mets had other opportunities three batters reached in the second , but none scored juan lagares and travis d'arnaud opened the fifth with consecutive singles , but the mets got only one run , with young grounding out and d'arnaud being caught in a rundown the mets also stranded a runner in the sixth and , with one out in the seventh , had andrew brown on second when d'arnaud was called out on strikes wright and murphy , who had been upset with calls throughout the game , voiced their displeasure with toby basner , the homeplate umpire , and were ejected it was the first career ejection for murphy and the fourth for wright there was some disagreements , wright said afterward without being more specific murphy said everybody who watched the game knows i do n't think i need to say anything else about it a disagreement is the best way to describe it wilson contributed to the mets' frustration , too , striking out nine batters over his seven innings the mets were not exactly equipped to make up a ninerun deficit , but once colon left , their task grew even more difficult as scott rice and john lannan combined to surrender five more runs then the mets were off to arizona , humbled , their record having dropped to 57 this was just a flatout beating , wright said
the attended the funeral of martin st louis s mother , france st louis , on sunday afternoon in laval , quebec , just outside montreal the new york ranger family has been touched by a little quebec family in a deep , profound way , coach alain vigneault said at bell centre in montreal after returning from the service marty took the podium and shared some incredible moments it was a very deep message st louis , whose mother died at 63 of a heart attack may 8 , has been dividing his time between his family and the rangers , who lead the montreal canadiens , one game to none , in the eastern conference finals after saturday s game , in which he scored the first goal , he said in french that his first thought after the goal was of his mother she was proud that i made the nhl and that she saw me play here , he said i'm trying to continue to play in her honor st louis remained with his family after the service , which was also attended by james l dolan , the rangers' owner , and steven stamkos and ted purcell of the tampa bay lightning , st louis s former team st louis and his family are moving on through our team , vigneault said the fact that we 're still playing is enabling them to cope dominic moore , whose wife died of cancer last year , is a friend and teammate of st louis s one thing that he said to me was that he understands better what i went through , having gone through something similar himself , moore said he was there for me , and it s nice that we 're here for him this weekend
a surprising number of senate republicans 10 out of 45 ! supported an extension of unemployment benefits in a procedural vote this afternoon many of them live in states with large numbers of jobless people , and would have a hard time explaining their opposition to a bill that provides five months of extra aid but an unsurprising number of house republicans plan to kill the bill , led by speaker john boehner their districts are ideologically tailored to prevent any serious blowback from a vote against government benefits of any kind this dynamic has gone on for so long the house killing good ideas from the senate , whether or not senate republicans support them that many voters have stopped paying attention to the details and just blame washington dysfunction or president obama s leadership skills for the inadequate response to serious problems but there is a very specific reason why nothing is getting done in washington republican intransigence and democrats announced a plan this week to remind voters of that fact they plan to push ahead with a package of at least 10 bills that would benefit the middle class and those hoping to join it , knowing full well that republicans will either filibuster the bills in the senate or kill them in the house in addition to the unemployment benefit extension they advanced today , the package includes bills to raise the minimum wage , eliminate the salary gap between men and women , cut the interest rate on college loans , and end tax loopholes that help businesses with overseas incomes other bills would protect medicare from various republican plans to cut it , spend money on infrastructure repair , and make child care more affordable senator patty murray of washington proposed an important expansion of the earned income tax credit , which will be a huge benefit to lowincome childless families and twoearner families , following a proposal by mr obama earlier this year and in the house , democrats officially introduced a discharge petition to force a vote on the senate s immigration bill , which has languished for months discharge petitions almost always fail , and so do most ambitious democratic agendas it s pretty clear that for the rest of this election year , both democrats and republicans in congress will produce a depressingly long list of failed symbolic bills , designed only to highlight the stubbornness of the opposition but consider what those symbolic agendas stand for republicans will pass more bills to tear down health insurance reform , cut spending on social programs , and allow anonymous billionaires to donate unlimited amounts to taxexempt political groups democrats will try to put more money in working people s wallets the cynics in washington call those message bills , and the message is clearer than ever
london last year , the council in birmingham , britain s second largest city , received an anonymous document that supposedly advised militant muslims on how to take over the governing bodies of staterun schools and impose islamist values since the socalled trojan horse plot was reported in march , it has become the center of a national controversy the original document is almost certainly a hoax , but it is clear that something is profoundly wrong with several schools in birmingham and elsewhere what , exactly , has largely been lost in the fog of ideological dispute the trojan horse affair has become an illustration both of the fraught debate about islam and of the contradictory character of public policy the government s initial response to begin an inquiry led by a former police counterterrorism chief , peter clarke suggested that the issue was as much about terrorism as educational values since then , four other official inquiries have investigated some 21 schools in birmingham two of those by ofsted , britain s school inspectorate , and by the education funding agency , another government regulator recently published reports they painted a grim picture five of the 21 schools were placed in special measures , an administrative status applied to schools deemed to be failing another 11 would be monitored because the quality of leadership and management requires improvement the ofsted report described members of the governing body at one school attempting to promote a particular and narrow faithbased ideology in another , certain subjects regarded as unislamic , including music , were removed from the syllabus the report talked also of gender segregation in some subjects none of the five schools , the report concluded , were doing enough to mitigate against cultural isolation or to prepare pupils adequately for life in modern britain but if the management at these schools is disturbing , so is the official response although no evidence has been produced to link the trojan horse affair to terrorism , ofsted criticized the schools for not taking sufficiently seriously the government s counterterrorism program , prevent but why should they unless all muslim children are considered potential terrorists \? the report s conclusions seem framed by a political agenda rather than certain schools' need for better governance what the investigations have revealed is not a jihadist plot , but attempts to enforce conservative religious values what is particularly ironic is that the government itself has encouraged communities to pursue their values within schools the state education system has always incorporated a substantial sector of socalled church schools , both catholic and anglican other faiths also receive state funding there are a number of jewish schools , a handful of sikh and hindu ones and about a dozen muslim establishments in the name of a more diverse school system , the coalition government expanded the policy of the previous labour government to free schools from state control and the national curriculum , and give parents and school officials greater say in setting a school s ethos two years ago , after criticism of a booklet used by catholic schools that told pupils the homosexual act is disordered and contrary to god s natural purpose , education secretary michael gove defended the right of schools to promote their values private schools , outside the state system , should be free to teach creationism and other types of religious teachings , the government has ruled , because of the right of parents to bring up their children as they see fit ofsted guidelines published earlier this year permit muslim schools to segregate pupils by sex , restrict the teaching of music and art and allow girls to wear the hijab as a part of their identity and a commitment to their beliefs within islam \( in light of the birmingham events , ofsted appears to be reconsidering its advice , but no new guidelines have yet been issued \) if such practices are acceptable in faith schools , why not in all schools where parents may desire them \? and if these values were unacceptable in the nondenominational birmingham schools because they did not prepare pupils adequately for life in modern britain , why should they be tolerated in faith schools \? the trojan horse story reveals the contradictions in government policy , raising questions not only about the encouragement of faith schools , but also about the approach toward multiculturalism policy makers have tended to treat minority communities as if each was distinct and homogeneous , composed of people defined by a singular view of culture and faith successive governments have managed diversity by putting people into ethnic boxes and using those boxes to shape public policy as a result , policy makers have too often ignored the diversity within minority communities and they have taken the most conservative , reactionary figures to be the authentic voices of those communities whether or not there was a plot to take over birmingham schools is almost moot there was no need for a plot by fragmenting the school system , pushing the mantra of parental choice and encouraging communities to promote their values , the government itself opened the door to islamists the trojan horse matter reveals how the public debate about islam has become polarized between those who think that any problem concerning the muslim community must involve the threat of terrorism and those who insist that any criticism of muslim customs is islamophobic issues of poor leadership at specific schools have become politicized , while the real political problems that helped create the mess are ignored instead of promoting a secular state education system , with a shared educational framework that would ensure that all children are taught to a common standard , the government has encouraged different minority communities to define their notion of education and to devise their own curriculum and when it goes disastrously wrong , as in birmingham , rather than question its own policies , it blames the community
russians are watching their country suffer another avoidable the blame for this rests largely with the disastrous policies of president vladimir putin , who has consistently put his ego , his territorial ambitions and the financial interests of his cronies ahead of the needs of his country as much as 19 percent on monday after the central bank of russia sharply raised its benchmark interest rate to 17 percent in the middle of the night in a desperate attempt to keep capital from fleeing the country since june , the russian currency has about 50 percent against the dollar because russia relies heavily on imported food and other goods , the decline in its currency is fueling inflation consumer prices last month compared with a year earlier and also increased 83 percent in october russia s immediate problems were caused by the recent collapse of global crude oil prices and the financial sanctions imposed by the united states and europe in an effort to get mr putin to stop stirring conflict in ukraine but the rot goes far deeper long before he annexed the crimean peninsula and began backing prorussian forces in eastern ukraine , mr putin created an economic system that allowed a coterie of insiders to grow wealthy on russia s vast oil and gas reserves he did little to diversify the economy or to make it more resilient now russian officials have to make difficult choices , none of which are good as the ruble has collapsed , many individuals and businesses have been trying to take money out of the country or spend it the international monetary fund in october that about 100 billion could leave russia by the end of the year the central bank of russia has tried to stem that tide by raising interest rates , which in turn slams the brakes on an already fragile economy some analysts believe that moscow will soon have no choice but to impose capital controls , a move that would further isolate russia from the rest of the global economy russia has large financial reserves about 4205 billion at the end of november but some of that money is tied up in gold and sovereign wealth funds that cannot be tapped easily to defend the ruble , of the peterson institute while the government does not have a large external debt , many russian banks and corporations , including large oil and gas businesses , were on the hook for about 614 billion in at the end of september some of those firms will struggle to repay their loans if russia s economy deteriorates further and oil prices stay at current levels or decline further mr putin has taken great relish in poking the west now that he is in trouble , the rest of the world is unlikely to rush to his aid on tuesday , a white house that president obama intends to sign a bill that would authorize additional sanctions on russia s energy and defense industries that bill would also authorize the administration to supply arms to ukraine s government the sensible thing for mr putin to do would be to withdraw from ukraine this would bring immediate relief from sanctions , and that would ease the current crisis and give officials room to start fixing the country s economic problems the question is whether this reckless leader has been sufficiently chastened to change course
washington financial disclosure reports released by the supreme court on friday showed that book royalties continued to fill the bank accounts of certain justices , while most bolstered their incomes with teaching assignments justice antonin scalia took more trips than any of his colleagues in 2013 , filing for reimbursement on 28 excursions , including one to peru , one to germany and two trips to italy he earned nearly 77 , 000 from book royalties for the year , on top of his 244 , 400 salary justice stephen g breyer came in second for royalties collected in 2013 , though the gulf between the two is vast justice breyer added close to 11 , 000 to his earnings with a check from his publisher he also traveled to the most foreign countries , including trips to london , paris , canada , norway , sweden and monaco justice sonia sotomayor did not report any book earnings in 2013 , though she received nearly 2 million in advances in 2012 for her memoir sales may not have exceeded the advances most of the nine justices list lengthy and complex investment portfolios , so it can be difficult to determine their total assets federal financial disclosure reports allow highlevel officials to list their assets and incomes in wide ranges , requiring little specificity a justice could , for example , have a 3 million asset , but would only have to value the investment between 1 million and 5 million that is as detailed as many of the figures get but the reports were still revealing , allowing a peek into the private lives of the men and women serving on the highest court in the country justice breyer was reimbursed for travel to a wedding he attended in nantucket last august , and justice sotomayor reported debts on four retail credit cards , with 15 , 000 or less on each account none of the justices reported receiving any gifts in 2013 these are the first disclosures to be released since the justices' salaries increased in january chief justice john g roberts jr is now paid 255 , 500 , up from 223 , 500 , and associate justices now make 244 , 400 , up from 213 , 900 the supreme court does not make the reports available online
public trials are a cornerstone of a democratic society but in the lookingglass world of legal challenges to the federal government s terror watch lists , even people who succeed in showing that they were mistakenly included on such a list have no easy path around the walls of official secrecy and obstruction on jan 14 , following a trial , a federal judge in san francisco ruled that the department of homeland security had to correct its erroneous inclusion of a malaysian academic on the nofly list at the same time , however , united states district judge william alsup , at the government s request , kept his actual ruling under seal until the court of appeals can weigh in the case involved rahinah ibrahim , a professor of architecture and design who had been a doctoral student at stanford university she sued the government after she was to hawaii in 2005 , handcuffed and detained in a holding cell for two hours officials later released her and said she had been mistakenly placed on the nofly list , apparently because a professional group she was affiliated with had a name similar to that of a terrorist organization ms ibrahim flew to hawaii and then on to malaysia , but when she tried to return to the united states she found that her student visa had been revoked on unspecified terrorrelated grounds she has not been able to return to the united states since in a of his ruling , judge alsup found that ms ibrahim s due process rights had been violated he ordered the government to correct its mistake and to certify under oath that it had done so he also ordered officials to reveal to ms ibrahim the specific grounds on which they denied her visa the ruling is a significant victory for government accountability , and it could be one for transparency , too , depending on how the appeals process plays out judge alsup frequently showed his frustration at the government s demands that the courtroom be closed and that many of the trial documents be heavily redacted or kept from the public record trials are important trials are supposed to be public , after they tried to classify evidence that was already public still , judge alsup reluctantly agreed to seal his full verdict until april 15 in order to give the federal appeals court time to address the ruling meanwhile , the government continues to resist the release of the judge s verdict , even though it has admitted that ms ibrahim s inclusion on the nofly list was a and has conceded that she is not a threat to our national security and ms ibrahim is far from alone terror watch lists remain pointlessly overbroad , with names scattered among about a dozen lists \( the nofly list , which consisted of 16 names before sept 11 , 2001 , had as of early 2012 \) after more than eight years and countless court proceedings , none of which ms ibrahim was allowed to attend , she has won a measure of justice but it should not have been this difficult
lucerne , switzerland for a critic already stretching his travel budget \( ever thus \) , it was hard to know just when to leave the monthlong , with its tightknit web of overlapping themes , programs and series friday was perhaps as good an exit as any , with the festival rounding into its second weekend and offering a rich crosssection of its varied and often innovative activities inevitably , some business was left unfinished , the saddest miss being a rare performance of luciano berio s monumental coro on saturday , with conducting the lucerne festival academy orchestra and chorus but the performance was shaping up well on friday , when mr rattle discussed the work in the festival s free earlyevening series , 40 minutes , with demonstrations from the young performers , for an overflow crowd in the 650seat lucerne hall of the kkl \( kultur und kongresszentrum luzern \) the hourlong coro \( 1976 \) , pairing off 40 instrumentalists with 40 vocalists , sets a variety of texts ranging from the personal and romantic to the apocalyptic , and builds to a harrowing final line by neruda , come and see the blood in the streets mr rattle s description of the work , like the world and all its history and all its music , was entertaining and inviting a splendid appetizer for a meal whose main course this listener could not , alas , savor , but amply nourishing on its own then , on friday , andris nelsons and the lucerne festival orchestra returned to the kkl concert hall , where they had opened the festival a week before with a here again , mr nelsons took over a program originally scheduled for claudio abbado , the orchestra s former conductor , who died in january brahms s third symphony and chopin s first piano concerto , with , a longtime abbado collaborator , as soloist the brahms performance was wonderful , with none of the tentativeness of the earlier ones slowish tempos in the first and third movements merely added to a general sense of luxuriance in the sound mr pollini begins to look frail at 72 , and an errant phrase or two at the start of the concerto raised fears for his performance but he soon righted himself and went on to show commanding virtuosity , with an occasional volatility that must have kept mr nelsons on his toes finally , on friday , the festival s free latenight lounge series at bourbaki , a nearby club , offered solo stints by the violinist and the bandone nist michael zisman midori s concert was especially valuable for those of us who had attended the orchestral concert and thus had to miss her first evening of bach s unaccompanied sonatas and partitas in the franziskanerkirche \( st francis church \) as with most things she undertakes , midori did the club date on her own terms she simply played one of the bach partitas \( bwv 1006 , in e \) , but played it for all it was worth , with fire and intensity there were no added frills , no talk her sound was mostly beautiful , minimally compromised by the necessary amplification and some distant background noise aside , the couple of hundred listeners seemed rapt , mostly as quiet as the church mice in the franziskanerkirche must have been , but raucous in their sustained applause at the end the 40 minutes events each intended as a sort of snapshot of the festival , whether a lecturedemonstration 0r an open rehearsal and the lounge series represent the festival s attempts to attract wider audiences , and younger listeners in particular michael haefliger , who recently renewed his contract as the lucerne festival s executive and artistic director to 2020 , elaborated on that theme in an interview on thursday he expressed particular satisfaction at the family turnouts at 40 minutes events , and at the rattle talk , there were huge pillows for parents with small children right up front he also spoke of the possibility of expanding the festival which in addition to its flagship summer event presents festivals at easter and in november \( a piano showcase \) , on a 267 million annual budget to include a fourth element along these lines he gave little hint of its nature , saying only , we 'd be building on what we 're doing , trying to build new audiences and attract the younger generation , thinking into the future among the other notable events in the week just past , matthias pintscher conducted the ensemble intercontemporain in excellent performances of works by this year s composers in residence , unsuk chin and johannes maria staud , in the lucerne hall on aug 17 but his own piece , bereshit \( in the beginning , 2012 \) a sort of musical recreation of the creation , taking its title from the opening of the torah and its start from the note f made the biggest impression on tuesday evening , daniel harding conducted the mahler chamber orchestra in works by dvorak and in the premiere of wolfgang rihm s horn concerto in the concert hall , with stefan dohr as the excellent soloist mr rihm has attempted a sort of an inversion of the concerto medium here , with lyricism prevailing over virtuosity and the cadenza a point of quiet rather than display the work ends with the merest of puffs from the horn a virtual study in anticlimax on wednesday evening , steven verhaert led a brass ensemble of the festival orchestra in a concert of works by gesualdo , lully , janacek and kodaly at the kkl that and another chamber program on thursday , by the pianist oliver schnyder and string players of the festival orchestra , went very well which was no surprise , given the overall quality of the festival orchestra players members of the mahler chamber orchestra and soloists handpicked by mr abbado mr nelsons s superb brahms performance can only intensify the question , amid rampant speculation , whether mr abbado s orchestra will next year become mr nelsons s to keep
el segundo , calif dean lombardi , the general manager of the , said he rarely reads hockey news because he figures he knows everything he should by doing his job instead , lombardi is a voracious reader of newspapers , magazines and books about other sports what he has observed over the years is that issues that hit football , basketball and baseball typically arrive in hockey , with its lower public profile , about five years later but the issue of domestic violence , which mushroomed nationally after a video emerged of the nfl s ray rice punching his future wife in an elevator , did not take that long to reach the nhl it was closer to five weeks so on tuesday , the day after kings defenseman slava voynov was accused of domestic violence and was subsequently suspended indefinitely by the nhl , lombardi found himself wondering why he , and the nhl , had not done more to confront the issue if the rice video and other cases including professional athletes served to raise public awareness of domestic violence around the country , it did not prompt the kings to address it with their players and i think that s where we have to take some responsibility flat out , lombardi said we have a bigger responsibility now we train and we provide access to training physically we provide meals so they eat properly well , you know what , we 've got a responsibility here now to train them in other areas and i do n't mean having a guy come in and give a speech once a year the defending stanley cup champions were back on the ice tuesday for the first time since voynov s arrest after practice , players were circumspect tiptoeing the line between supporting their teammate while not condoning domestic violence we 're all disappointed , center jarret stoll said it s unfortunate that we have to deal with this , but we hope it can all get sorted out defenseman matt greene , an alternate captain , said it affects everybody , but i think it affects his family the most and that s who we 're going to think about i just feel bad for everybody involved in the situation one player who was not made available to speak with the news media was drew doughty , the star defenseman , who was investigated in a sexual assault during the 2012 playoffs charges were not filed in his case coach darryl sutter said he agreed with the nhl s suspension , which was handed down monday before voynov had been released on 50 , 000 bail voynov was arrested in a hospital waiting room after the redondo beach police spoke to a woman who had been hospitalized sutter met with voynov on monday at the player s home , but few others appear to have spoken with voynov lombardi said voynov had shut off his cellphone sutter , before a group of about 20 members of the news media far more than typically attend practice answered most questions tersely and revealed little , until the last one , when he was asked if he had spoken to his players about domestic violence i'm sure you talk to your children about things that happen , sutter said a lot of these players are like children to me the closeknit nature of the locker room has been credited by the kings for their resilience and as factor in their winning stanley cups as a no 8 seed in 2012 and last june , when they rebounded from a threegamestonone deficit to beat san jose in the first round voynov , 24 , of chelyabinsk , russia , has been a key figure on those championship teams and signed a sixyear , 25 million contract after the 201213 season but he had been a quiet presence in the locker room though he has been in north america since the kings drafted him in 2008 , voynov does not have a strong command of english but lombardi said voynov had never been a problem in any way he cited two instances after voynov was drafted and when his father was ill when voynov could have returned to russia and made more money than he would have at the junior level and the minor leagues here those are n't the same as what we 're talking about today , but those were the only character tests that we had seen and he had passed , with flying colors , lombardi said now this is a different issue lombardi said the nhl like other leagues would usually wait until the legal process played out those standards no longer apply now , the league is conducting its own investigation , along with the los angeles county district attorney s office i had this in the back of my mind a year and a half ago not specifically this kind of thing but it kind of irritates me that what was in the back of my mind about some things like this , and i let it fall through the cracks , lombardi said this is as much about our organization s responsibility we 've got an obligation here , too we need to do a better job that s just the truth i do n't care if that s indicting ourselves
london the two men who killed a soldier on a london street last year had figured in seven investigations by british intelligence agencies , and one of the men had threatened online to commit just such a murder five months before the attack , lawmakers said in a report issued on tuesday a parliamentary committee investigating , lee rigby , in may 2013 listed numerous failings by intelligence agencies but nonetheless concluded that given what was known at the time , they had not been in a position to stop the murder it did , however , blame an unidentified american technology company for failing to tell the british authorities about the online threats , which came to light only after the murder facebook , which was identified by british news outlets as the company in question , declined to comment on the case but issued a statement saying it took measures to prevent its services from being used by terrorists the attackers , michael adebolajo , 29 , and michael adebowale , 23 , for killing mr rigby , who was run over by a car in broad daylight and then stabbed to death in the woolwich area of southeast london mr adebowale was ordered to serve a minimum of 45 years , and mr adebolajo was given a full life term tuesday s report ignited a political debate over the responsibility of technology companies to aid spy agencies at a time when the british government is seeking more powers over them speaking before parliament , prime minister david cameron said that internet companies' networks were being used to plot murder and mayhem , and that it was their social responsibility to act mr cameron also said would spend an additional 130 million pounds , or about 204 million , over two years to try to prevent lone wolf terrorist attacks after reviewing hundreds of secret documents , the parliamentary committee reported that the two attackers had , between them , appeared in seven inquiries by british agencies , and it criticized delays , errors and the agencies' failure to follow procedures and record decisions mr adebolajo was a high priority for the british domestic intelligence agency mi5 during two investigations , the report said , though intrusive monitoring of him ended about a month before the murder the investigations revealed no evidence that an attack had been planned , it said the report also pointed to failings by british intelligence services in monitoring mr adebolajo after his arrest in kenya in 2010 , where he had been detained because it was believed that he was trying to travel to somalia to join the shabab militant islamic group the response of the british intelligence services was inadequate , the committee said a significant number of britons are thought to have traveled to iraq and syria to join militants there the report said mr adebolajo had claimed that during his detention , he was mistreated by the kenyan authorities , beaten and threatened with electrocution and rape they failed to investigate his allegations of mistreatment , the report said , adding that the agencies did not grant him sufficient priority upon his return to the uk and did not seem to take the claims seriously the report concluded , given what the agencies knew at the time , they were not in a position to prevent the murder of mr rigby , who was a fusilier , a type of infantryman however , the report highlighted an online exchange in december 2012 between mr adebowale and an extremist overseas , in which mr adebowale expressed his intent to kill a soldier at the time , the american technology company had disabled eight of mr adebowale s accounts because of online comments , some of which suggested terrorist intent , the report said but not all of his accounts were disabled , and the company did not inform british intelligence the party which could have made a difference was the company on whose platform the exchange took place , the report said however , this company does not appear to regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that its systems identify such exchanges , or to take action or notify the authorities when its communications services appear to be used by terrorists there is therefore a risk that , however unintentionally , it provides a safe haven for terrorists to communicate within , it added the report said that none of the major american companies it had approached proactively monitored and reviewed suspicious content or believed they must comply with british warrants technology companies , including apple , microsoft , yahoo and twitter , need to play their part , malcolm rifkind , chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee , said at a news conference after the publication of the report mr rifkind said he could not name the company that had hosted mr adebowale s conversation because information about it had been given in confidence to british intelligence agencies by a source he did not name responding to a bbc report that it was the company responsible , facebook said it did not comment on individual cases but was horrified by the vicious murder of mr rigby facebook s policies are clear we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes , it said in a statement in a statement issued by that opposes the war on terror , jeremiah adebolajo , brother of michael adebolajo , said it was opportunistic to use the report to expand the scope of online monitoring this report is nothing more than a distraction from the motives behind the attack and a way to put a particular segment of british society under further pressure and surveillance , the statement said

hidalgo , tex border agents drove their patrol vehicles one recent day at dusk through this spit of land on the bank of the rio grande here , in a place known as the devil s corner , smugglers on the mexican side have chosen to bring thousands of women and children to american soil after only a few minutes scouting the dirt roads , the agents came upon a cluster of illegal migrants , huddled in tall grass under palm trees , seeking respite from the baking heat they made no effort to flee as the border patrol drove up questioned by the agents , a boy from honduras said his name was alejandro and that he was 8 years old who are you with \? asked raul l ortiz , deputy chief of the border patrol for the rio grande valley , speaking in spanish by myself , alejandro said , looking up at the man in the olive uniform and pulling a birth certificate , carefully folded , from his jeans the only item he carried where are your parents , alex \? chief ortiz asked , using a nickname to put the boy at ease in san antonio , he said but the child had no address for his family in the texas city 250 miles to the north , or for an aunt in maryland , which he thought was just as close the agents gave him water and the boy smiled gratefully , not knowing that his journey , already three weeks long , would likely be a lot longer families and children have become a highprofit , lowrisk business for mexican narcotics cartel bosses who , chief ortiz said , have taken control of human smuggling across the rio grande they now offer family packages , migrants said , charging up to 7 , 500 to bring a minor alone or a mother with children from central america to the american side of the river smugglers like to use this snakeinfested , thornridden brushland for their crossings a federal wildlife refuge , the site is downstream from the anzalduas dam , where the river slows and narrows , making it easy to paddle across the bank is strewn with wornout sneakers , broken baby bottles and rotting life preservers , the refuse of migrants who made it across and moved on in less than two hours one evening last week , border patrol agents encountered 37 migrants walking the dusty roads here alejandro said he had been brought by santiago the smuggler another migrant in the group was probably traveling with the boy , a neighbor or a cousin , chief ortiz said once they were back at the border patrol station , agents would have to figure out who that was more than 52 , 000 minors traveling without their parents have been caught crossing the southwest border illegally since october , including 9 , 000 in may alone , a record the migration surge also includes 39 , 000 adults with children detained since october , also an unprecedented figure authorities anticipate they will apprehend more than 240 , 000 illegal migrants , about threequarters from central america , in the rio grande valley during this fiscal year many migrants say they are fleeing poverty and vicious gang violence at home , and the united states was giving entry permits for women and children but many , especially the youngest , are coming to reconnect with families , hoping to join parents or close relatives who live in this country , often without papers there s obviously a host of reasons that motivates the individuals to cross , chief ortiz said but trying to reunite with a family member who may already be here is probably one of the ones that comes at the top chief ortiz watched as agents coaxed information from the new detainees the migrants answered , some apprehensively , others seemed relieved , none attempted to resist a 14yearold boy from honduras said , my parents are dead there was an aunt in new orleans he wanted to find a 19yearold guatemalan woman was tugging her 2yearold child , whose father she said was in indiana having lost her way at high noon , she was reeling from dehydration she gulped water the agents offered increasing numbers of women and children caught crossing illegally have been able to stay in the united states border authorities are required to turn over unaccompanied minors within 72 hours to the department of health and human services , which oversees detention shelters and works to find parents or guardians in this country after this month , new shelters for minors were opened at three military bases officials had been releasing most women apprehended with children , but white house officials announced last week in an effort to discourage others from coming most days , the crossings here come at dawn and at dusk the smugglers pull up in vans on the mexican bank , and send loads of migrants across the river on inflatable rafts , sometimes three or four trips in an hour guides know there is little chance the border patrol will stop them at the international boundary midstream a lot of the times it s in our best interests and the best interests of the people on the raft to not attempt to necessarily grab them from the raft , said enrique romero , a border patrol agent , as he stood by the river eyeing the smuggler scouts who eyed him from the far bank you put their lives at risk while men are told to run , women and children are instructed by smugglers to look for the border patrol and turn themselves in they are told , falsely , that is the way to get a permit the agents were initially cautious with the migrants , checking for gang members or drug couriers but soon chief ortiz was fistbumping with the children a boy , 4 , pulled on his ears to clown for the agents this week secretary jeh c johnson of homeland security sent an open letter warning central american parents who are considering sending their children in the hands of smugglers , many children are traumatized and psychologically abused by their journey or worse , beaten , starved , sexually assaulted or sold into the sex trade , he wrote there are no permits' or free passes at the end at the border , agents trained to stop drug traffickers and adult crossers are adjusting to the new migrants we 're law enforcement officers , but a lot of us are parents or we have young siblings , chief ortiz said we try to make sure they recognize that , you know what , it s going to be ok you 've got some safety and security here
continuing our look at the rookie on each nfl team who will have the most fantasy impact this season , whether for him or for the players around him , we turn our attention to the afc east and north watkins was the toprated receiver in the draft , and he should carry that distinction , among rookies , into fantasy drafts he compares favorably to torrey smith and julio jones , but the plodding offense in buffalo will hold him back that said , dealing away stevie johnson showed the faith the bills have in watkins , and even in a bad offense he should lead the team in targets and be a solid wr3 or flex option with the upside for more while he lacks the flash of watkins and mike evans , landry is an effective player who should step into a prominent role in the slot davone bess was a solid ppr option in that role until leaving the dolphins last season , and landry could catch 50 to 60 passes if he gets the role between mike wallace and brian hartline on the outside none of the patriots' picks stand out as particularly fantasyrelevant , but gallon could be an intriguing option catching passes from his fellow michigan wolverine tom brady once training camp starts , the patriots are as openminded as any other team in the league when it comes to the depth chart , so gallon will have a shot to work his way into the lineup despite being a seventhround pick the jets' offense lacks excitement , but geno smith was effective throwing to two subpar tight ends last year amaro spent 875 percent of his snaps in the slot last season , so he is certainly comfortable as a receiver the jets' receiving game behind eric decker is questionable at best , so there will be room for amaro right from the start he s not a te1 , but he s certainly a te2 with some upside , and he will be worth monitoring the ravens did not draft many players expected to make a significant impact in 2014 , but taliaferro figures to fight for snaps in the backfield although he has great hands and blocking ability , he lacks the speed and quickness most hope to see in a halfback although he has not played much fullback , you have to wonder if the 6foot0 , 229pound back with plus blocking skills does not end up as a fulltime fullback before the year is over ray rice owners have to be happy that this is the only new competition in the backfield this year the pick was somewhat disappointing to giovani bernard fans , but hill figures to have a complementary role in the backfield this year he profiles as a twodown back who works mostly behind the tackles he is an upgrade from benjarvus greenellis , but that does not mean he will get as many touches as greenellis did last year hill will have to earn the trust of the coaching staff , and many still expect bernard s role to expand in his sophomore season could it be anybody else \? yes , the team likes terrance west a lot , but manziel is a unique player to evaluate and value no matter how you feel about him , there is a chance for greatness the closest comparison might be robert griffin iii s rookie season , in which he parlayed his passing and rushing ability into fantasy stardom the apparent loss of josh gordon for the season hurts manziel , but he has some big targets to throw to in jordan cameron and the sleeper charles johnson his upside will make it tempting to select him on draft day as a no 2 qb \( assuming he gets the starting job over brian hoyer \) archer will probably never be an everydown back , but his blazing speed will help the steelers' offense as a change of pace to le 'veon bell he s not small he s short , , and after watching a highlight or two of archer you can see how dynamic and versatile he really is whether he gets enough touches to be fantasyrelevant is still the question , but archer is fun to watch and should line up all over the field this season
washington how can a president fix more roads and bridges without any new money to spend \? president obama s answer on thursday was to announce new initiatives to encourage privatesector investment in the nation s infrastructure , including the creation of a onestop shop at the department of transportation to forge partnerships between state and local governments , and public and private developers and investors stymied by republican lawmakers who refuse to go along with mr obama s call for vast new spending on the nation s infrastructure , the president is spending the week trying to demonstrate that he can still find ways to stop big things from crumbling the executive actions the president announced aim to turbocharge private investment in our roads , rails , highways and bridges , said jeffrey zients , the director of his national economic council if we do n't act , we could lose our competitive edge in infrastructure it s a nobrainer we need to make these investments on thursday , mr obama appeared at the i495 bridge over the christina river in wilmington , del , a span that has been closed since june , when engineers discovered that four of its columns were leaning to one side that has created a traffic nightmare for the 90 , 000 vehicles that travel the major east coast highway every day in his remarks , mr obama criticized congress for failing to invest in infrastructure , saying that republicans have refused to focus on the need for a longterm plan for paying for transportation and other projects if washington were working the way it was supposed to , congress would be creating jobs right now , mr obama told a small crowd at a port near the interchange instead of barely paying our bills for the present we should be planning and investing for the future mr obama arrived in delaware with empty pockets , but armed with what his advisers said were creative ways that similar problems can be fixed none of the steps we are taking should be seen as a substitute for adequate public financing , because there is n't a substitute for that , secretary of transportation anthony foxx told reporters in a conference call with mr zients and treasury secretary jacob j lew to detail the plan but mr foxx said he hoped local and state leaders would take advantage of the new build america transportation investment center mr obama is creating at the transportation department designed to help the government seek partnerships with private companies to get projects underway using existing federal credit programs and to reimagine how to meet their infrastructure needs we have a huge opportunity in front of us if we just seize it , mr foxx said lawmakers from both parties have acknowledged the need to address the deteriorating roads , bridges , railways , ports and sewer systems across the country but few agree on how to pay for it mr obama acknowledged the limits of what he can do without that agreement but he announced his intention to create the build america investment initiative , which aims to focus all of the federal government s agencies on the task of investing in infrastructure officials said the initiative would help the government seek partnerships with private companies to get projects underway , using existing federal credit programs to do that , the first step will be the creation of a build america transportation investment center in the department of transportation this center will serve as a onestop shop for state and local governments , public and private developers and investors seeking to utilize innovative financing strategies for transportation infrastructure projects , the fact sheet said the white house will also create a build america interagency working group that officials said would expand and increase private investment and collaboration by addressing barriers to private investment in the transportation area the treasury department will also host an infrastructure investment summit in september there s broad agreement that strengthening our nation s infrastructure is critical for economic growth , generating new jobs and business activity , mr lew said the announcements on thursday were stark evidence of the gridlock in washington but they came amid a glimmer of hope in the days ahead , congress is expected to agree on a shortterm financing bill to keep the nation s transportation trust fund solvent for several months the federal government is set to cut back its highway and infrastructure spending by 28 percent , starting aug 1 , forcing as many as 100 , 000 infrastructure projects to halt at the height of the building season and jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of jobs the federal highway trust fund pays for much of the road repairs and construction around the country , and is financed mostly by the gas tax , which has been declining as fuel efficiency improves the president has proposed closing business tax loopholes to bolster the fund over the longterm , but republicans have balked at the idea neither side wants to raise the gas tax rate in the meantime , lawmakers have seized on shortterm measures to delay the need for a longerterm solution aides said mr obama would offer his support for the temporary fix , but urge a more permanent solution we still need a longterm plan that cities and states can count on for steady and certain funding over several years not just months , mr foxx said during the conference call on the way to his speech about infrastructure , mr obama stopped at the charcoal pit , a wellknown wilmington , del , lunch place at the restaurant , the president shook hands and then sat down to eat with a woman who had written him a letter white house officials said that the woman , tanei benjamin , wrote to mr obama in july 2013 about her struggle as a single , working mother of one daughter who is now 6 years old after reading the letter from ms benjamin , officials said the president sent copies of her letter to his senior staff with a note at the bottom this is the person we are working for as mr obama sat down for lunch thursday , he declared , i'm starving ! and ordered a fourounce pit special a cheeseburger and fries he asked for the burger to be done mediumwell , and ordered a water , with lemon
an early happy holidays to those of you who have been hanging onto browns receiver josh gordon for 11 weeks for the rest of you , i'm sad to say that you 've got a lump of waiver wire coal waiting for you in your stocking this week since the fantasy football playoffs are just two weeks away for many leagues , the wires are quite barren in the majority of leagues i 'll preface this column by saying that i would n't strongly recommend picking up any of these players except for one while mccown has a low weektoweek floor , he s put up backtoback 19point outings and gets a great matchup with the bears defense this week with mike evans emerging as one of the league s top receivers , and a fairly cushy fantasy playoff schedule \( carolina and green bay in weeks 15 and 16 \) , mccown is worth a pickup for at least this week and maybe beyond do i trust hoyer \? no do i think he has a huge upside \? no however , tom brady s former understudy has put up doubledigit fantasy points in nine of his 11 games this season and gets to add one of the nfl s most dangerous receivers to his arsenal this weekend when gordon returns to the browns' lineup hoyer is a great bye week fillin for ben roethlisberger and cam newton owners as he gets to face a falcons defense that has allowed no less than 18 fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks in any of their last three games remember when i said there s only one guy i 'd strongly recommend picking up this week \? it s crowell with ben tate now looking for a new job , crowell will likely be the 1a to terrance west s 1b \( and he s available in over 75 percent of standard leagues ! \) this could admittedly get sticky , but i think crowell is the guy to own in cleveland now that tate is out of the picture he had 14 carries to west s five last weekend against the texans and he 'll get a juicy matchup against atlanta s leagueworst rushing defense this weekend i think most of us saw \( or at least read about \) what has now been statcorrected to be a 201yard , fourtouchdown game for gray on sunday night , so i wo n't belabor how good he looked in running northtosouth on 38 attempts \( none of which went for negative yardage \) should you pick him up \? absolutely did you just see the highwater mark of his season \( and probably his career \) \? absolutely we 're at the point of the season where we should be looking ahead when we make pickups and three of gray s next five games come against really good rushing defenses the patriots are a team that devises game plans based on matchups and i can guarantee you that they wo n't devise a game plan that consists of running gray straight into a solid defensive line so by all means , go pick up gray just do n't be surprised if he gets something like eight carries against the lions this week after allen robinson s injury , but shorts is still available in over 70 percent of standard leagues he 'll have to compete for targets with allen hurns and marqise lee , but shorts is coming off of backtoback games with five receptions \( which is n't great , but it s all relative \) and should be a focal point of the jaguars offense going forward there are n't many better receiving options on waivers right now if i were shopping the waiver wire , i 'd probably flip a coin when choosing between britt and shorts , as both are in similar situations as the best receiving option on a bad team with an average quarterback britt is coming off of a huge game against the broncos and should see plenty more targets against the chargers this week \( he had seven last week \) like pretty much everyone else in this week s column , i would n't pick up britt as muststart option , but he s a good week 12 fillin for owners of kelvin benjamin , antonio brown or martavis bryant i 've never been a huge fleener fan , but i can admit when i'm wrong he s put up backtoback solid weeks and now has four touchdowns on the season \( which is pretty good compared to the mess at tight end once you get past rob gronkowski , jimmy graham and julius thomas \) i 'll like fleener a lot more if dwayne allen misses this week with an ankle injury , but i think he s still worth a start against the jaguars this weekend even if allen plays i hate to pick on the poor jaguars , but there s really no reason not to at this point they 're allowing a leagueworst 139 fantasy points to opposing defenses and they 'll have to head to indianapolis to face what should be an angry colts defense this weekend i would n't go picking up the colts as a seasonlong option , but they 're one of the better \( the best \? \) streaming options this weekend
updated , 5 05 am et after disappearing from view for months , zhou yongkang has returned the official announcement tuesday evening that china s communist party is conducting an investigation into the former chief of domestic security prompted an easing of the censorship surrounding his case while the public may never set eyes on him again , his image is suddenly ubiquitous on chinese news portals and social media , mr zhou s grim visage looms large much of the discussion follows the party line that the takedown of one of the most powerful officials in china represents a triumph of the law but the new and likely temporary freedom to discuss mr zhou s case has provided an opportunity for dissenting voices to question whether it is more about a clash of powerful leaders than about simple corruption , whether he will face a criminal trial or the party s internal discipline mechanism , and whether his fate could spell trouble for other powerful retired officials xinhua , the staterun news agency , announced the investigation at 6 pm , shortly ahead of the official statement by the communist party s anticorruption body the 7 pm newscast on chinese state television , the widestreaching official media platform , made mr zhou s case the fourth item of its program the 18second announcement came after a discussion about president xi jinping , also the communist party general secretary , leading politburo meetings , and an announcement on the party plenum planned for october , which will focus on promoting the rule of law mr zhou took charge of the public security bureau in 2002 and controlled the central politics and law commission for 10 years , so he has an unavoidable responsibility for the retreat of the rule of law , the chinese media columnist liu shengjun wrote on sina weibo the pairing of the announcements of mr zhou s case and a party meeting focused on the rule of law was meant to convey a deep meaning , mr liu added that meaning was emphasized on wednesday in people s daily , the official newspaper of the communist party , which wrote in a frontpage editorial that the case against mr zhou showed that no official is above the law in socialist china , there is no power outside the cage of the system and there is no party member outside party discipline and the law , it said anybody who violates party discipline must be punished according to the rules and laws no specifics of the accusations against mr zhou have been officially detailed , although he is believed to have accumulated extensive wealth through his positions of leadership in china s oil industry , sichuan province and the domestic security apparatus a new york times investigation linked mr zhou , 71 , and his family members to at least 160 million in assets the language of the corruption body s statement on the case did not refer to him as comrade , an indication that he has been expelled from the party and could face criminal prosecution some online commenters questioned that procedure and raised concerns that the communist party s internal investigation process could shield mr zhou , a tiger in party parlance for highlevel corrupt officials , and the party itself from harsher scrutiny the biggest problem isn t the tiger , it s the cage , wrote the economist wang fuzhong probe in big tiger zhou shows chinese communist party s resolve to purify itself http tco 8lwcldeowx http tco 1ydrtqpglq  china xinhua news \( xhnews \) 30 jul 14 others raised questions about the corruption crackdown itself , which mr xi has pushed since coming to power and which has exceeded previous campaigns in both its breadth and the seniority of the officials targeted while the concerns about corruption within the ranks of chinese officialdom are undoubtedly real , the purge has also enabled mr xi to consolidate his power with unusual speed at the top in china , political enemies are often eliminated under the name of anticorruption , the novelist zeng lingbiao wrote on sina weibo unlike bo xilai , the former communist party secretary of chongqing who was sentenced to life in prison last year for corruption and abuse of power , mr zhou has attracted few supporters mr bo , who was considered an ally of mr zhou s , cultivated a populist image his campaigns against organized crime and promotion of maoistera nostalgia meant that some people were willing to speak on his behalf even as the party apparatus turned against him the outward symbols of mr zhou s career are the accumulation of his own power and that of the state security apparatus although a small window for commentary on his case has opened , there are no signs of anyone using it to rush to his defense of 20 visitors to ritan park in beijing who were asked about mr zhou on wednesday , most said such highlevel politics did not concern them and none was willing to provide a full name we ordinary people live our own lives , said a man in his 50s who works in a government agency the earth continues to revolve no matter who perishes for the urban times newspaper in kunming , the confluence of mr zhou s case and an anniversary celebration at a local zoo meant the paper could send a message without showing the fallen leader on its front page underneath a headline announcing the corruption investigation it ran a photo of a large tiger called guai guai it was walking obediently with a leash around its neck kiki zhao contributed research
someday soon , the will get around to shaking up their gridlocked outfield for now , though , they keep adding to it , like squeezing another car onto a crowded highway , just in time for the holiday rush pablo sandoval is not an outfielder , he is a third baseman but now that sandoval is headed to the as a free agent , for five years and about 100 million , pending a physical , he will bump another nearly official new red sox hitter , hanley ramirez , to the outfield ramirez , who is getting 88 million for four years , also pending a physical , has never played the outfield across 13 professional seasons but he told the red sox during negotiations that he would be comfortable moving to a new position and the red sox seem to have unlimited room for outfielders , even though the lineup card allows for only three mookie betts , jackie bradley jr , rusney castillo , yoenis cespedes , allen craig , daniel nava , ramirez and shane victorino could all make a case to be starting outfielders in the majors none can move to designated hitter in boston because that spot belongs to david ortiz for the red sox aggressive spenders yet again the deals for sandoval and ramirez , when completed , will open up an array of options and possibilities as they seek to rebuild their starting rotation and take another run at a championship it stands to reason that ramirez will play left field as another ramirez , manny , once did and that castillo , who signed a sevenyear , 725 million contract last summer after defecting from cuba , will also have a spot nava is a championshiplevel fourth outfielder , so he could stay , too that leaves cespedes and victorino , both with one year left on their contracts craig is owed 265 million through 2017 and is coming off a dreary season that only got worse after boston acquired him from st louis bradley , 24 , is an exceptional fielder but has struggled to hit , and betts , 22 , made a strong first impression last season ben cherington , boston s general manager , must shift these pieces to the right spots , and he has a glaring opening to address last summer the red sox swiftly disassembled the rotation that helped them win the 2013 world series , trading jon lester , john lackey , jake peavy and felix doubront the team s prospective 2015 rotation includes clay buchholz , who had a 534 earned run average in 28 starts last season , and joe kelly , who had a 420 era in 17 starts for the cardinals and the red sox beyond that are questions several young pitchers offer promise , but with the sandoval and ramirez signings , the red sox have shown their hand the red sox are going for it , again this is their intention every season , but they know a lost cause when they see one they were willing to sacrifice the end of their 2012 and 2014 seasons to better prepare for the future that paid off with the 2013 title , and now we will see how it works in 2015 the red sox have pursued lester in free agency , with several national league teams , including atlanta , st louis and the chicago cubs , also showing some degree of interest when in july , the red sox got back cespedes , who could help acquire a starter now they also got a better read on some young pitchers by using them so often down the stretch none of those pitchers rubby de la rosa , anthony ranaudo , allen webster , brandon workman performed especially well , but all could have appeal in trades , as could several younger arms half of boston s top 12 prospects , as ranked by , are pitchers under age 24 with no major league starts the red sox are well positioned to build a package of outfielders and pitchers that could entice the philadelphia phillies to deal cole hamels , their ace lefthander hamels turns 31 next month and is owed 96 million for the next four years the red sox presumably could work around hamels s notrade clause to boston such a move could take a while , but in any case , it is the kind of idea the red sox could at least explore with their surplus of outfielders and pitching prospects for now , they know they will have exactly nine years ago monday in a deal for josh beckett and mike lowell beckett and lowell starred in the 2007 postseason to lead the red sox to a championship , while ramirez established himself as an elite shortstop , most recently with the dodgers ramirez turns 31 next month , and his injury problems and defensive regression make left field more realistic now then there is sandoval , who caught the final out of the world series last month for the san francisco giants he was beloved in san francisco as one of the giants' many characters , playing the role of the overstuffed panda who feasts on pitchers in october at 28 , sandoval should still have prime years ahead , and the idea of someday shifting to dh is said to have appealed to him the red sox must hope that he stays in reasonably good shape , of course , and that he and ramirez avoid the path of adrian gonzalez and carl crawford , two highly paid imports who quickly soured on the intensity of the boston spotlight the dodgers allowed the red sox to reset by trading for gonzalez , crawford and others in 2012 the red sox' immediate success with their remaining stars and bargain free agents seemed to signal a shift in philosophy though maybe that was overstated nine months ago , the team president , larry lucchino , told reporters that his team was different from the yankees in the pursuit of expensive free agents it seems to me that they do it more often as a matter of course , lucchino said then and for us it would be more the exception than the rule one lastplace finish later , the red sox are on the verge of two major exceptions what they do next may be even more fascinating
as defenders pressed them on the perimeter and passing lanes disappeared , the searched for space against the on tuesday space for shots space to breathe they found very little of either amid a futile search for offense during the third quarter of their 9883 at madison square garden , the knicks compounded their troubles by neglecting to play much defense they looked distracted and distraught , and perhaps none of it should have come as a surprise after the knicks exceeded expectations in the opening week of the season , setbacks are inevitable coach derek fisher has said as much , several times already learning to stick with the offense will take time , he said again late tuesday , particularly against defenders with length and athleticism that s the hard part of this trying to figure out who you are within what we do , to still have faith that this will work out , fisher said that s hard for guys to do when the game is getting away from you the wizards' plan was clear deny secondary passes and disrupt the knicks' flow and after the wizards outscored the knicks by 3215 in the third quarter , carmelo anthony watched the game s final minutes from the bench , his night complete after he scored 18 points while shooting 8 of 23 from the field they just took control of the game , anthony said they were the more physical team tonight , but that s something we can correct paul pierce , a familiar foe in an unfamiliar uniform , scored 17 points for the wizards \( 31 \) , who shot 488 percent from the field and forced 18 turnovers garrett temple added 17 points , and john wall finished with 11 points and 7 assists a quiet night for him as long as i'm not turning the ball over and i'm giving my team a chance to win games , that s what point guards are known for in this league , wall said during the final four seasons of his playing career , fisher actually faced wall five times so fisher was personally acquainted with wall s unique set of skills speed and quickness , shiftiness in the open court and explosiveness at the rim in case his memory was fuzzy , fisher studied game tape of wall this week i 've probably seen him more in preparation for tonight , fisher said , than i ever did playing against him sure enough , the knicks made life difficult for wall but wall was not the issue the knicks shot 37 percent their offense was stagnant and they were left with little time to correct their problems a departure time of 10 50 pm was listed on a grease board in the locker room , as an idling bus waited to take the knicks to the airport their game tuesday was the first of four in five nights , an early test that will continue wednesday night in detroit our execution has to get better , said iman shumpert , who scored 19 points fisher acknowledged that the knicks were still thinking too much on offense he wants them to be more instinctive instead of having them slow down in transition to set up the triangle , fisher would like his players to seek opportunities in the open court layups , of course , are preferable to jumpers the early looks that the knicks got against the wizards tended to be open ones , from different angles , within the structure of offense , and then sometimes not at all shumpert pulled up in transition to knock down a 3pointer j r smith came off the bench to connect on his first fieldgoal attempt cole aldrich cut back door for a dunk off a pass from anthony a positive sign for the knicks if ever there was one they were up by 4540 at halftime but problems emerged the knicks \( 22 \) scored 3 points in the first 3 minutes 17 seconds of the second half , and the wizards capitalized wall fed pierce in transition for a 3pointer , which he buried as part of a 4point play later , wall attempted to squeeze his way through a cluster of defenders at 90 miles per hour , somehow managing to collide only with pablo prigioni and amar'e stoudemire and not the entire team it was that type of night for him and while wall often deferred to teammates , he found a way to have an effect after temple hit a 3pointer late in the third quarter , wall cut to the hoop to extend the lead to 8 at the other end , tim hardaway jr hoisted an air ball the wizards' lead soon swelled to 14 the knicks went nearly six minutes without scoring when you see something not working , your first instinct is to use another option , anthony said sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't tonight , it did n't the wizards are a surging contender in the eastern conference , albeit with one relic \( pierce \) from various rivalries past behind wall , who had three straight doubledoubles to start the season , the wizards are hoping to build on their appearance in the conference semifinals six months ago if the knicks were sudden upstarts after early wins against the cleveland cavaliers and the charlotte hornets , the wizards seemed pleased to pop their balloon we 'll figure it out , stoudemire said rebounds quincy acy sat out with a sore right wrist coach derek fisher said he wanted to be cautious with him , especially with a hectic schedule this week andre miller had 12 points in 17 minutes for the wizards
chris kreider may or may not be back in uniform for the offensechallenged rangers in game 4 against the penguins on wednesday night , but neither he nor his coach is saying either way kreider took part in a full practice wednesday morning for the first time since having surgery to repair a fractured left hand march 28 rangers coach alain vigneault said kreider had been medically cleared to play , but declined to say whether he would vigneault called game 4 as close to a must game for us as possible vigneault and kreider referred to his status as day to day kreider had 17 goals , including six on the power play , and 20 assists before his injury the rangers trailed the penguins two games to one , entering wednesday night s game at madison square garden and were looking for a way to score goals they failed to score in games 2 and 3 , the first time they suffered backtoback playoff shutouts since 1937 they managed only 22 shots on penguins goalie marcandre fleury in a , but peppered him with 35 shots in after game 3 , vigneault said that he thought the rangers played well , but he qualified that statement wednesday morning as well as i might think that we have played so far , at the end of the day it s easy to see we need to finish , he said we can say we 've had some great looks , but we 've got to get it done we 're down by a game , and we 've got to find a way to make that team pay for some of the mistakes that they make obviously they 've made us pay the last couple of days for our mistakes , and we need to do the same thing to them in team meetings wednesday , vigneault said , he pointed out ways his players must do a little bit better in attacking their net , attacking their goaltender he added , we have a couple of guys right now who are trying very hard , but they need to find a way to contribute one of them is rick nash , who is scoreless in the series and has one goal in 22 playoff games as a ranger he s seeing all the shots , so we have to get traffic in front of him , nash said of fleury we watch video on goalies and try to pick out their weaknesses they do n't have many but the one thing none of them like is traffic if kreider returns to the lineup , he will see time on the rangers' power play , which has failed to score in 34 straight advantages that is the nhl s longest such drought in a postseason since 2007 , when the anaheim ducks were goalless in 36 straight power plays \( the ducks also won the stanley cup that spring \) either way , the rangers can take heart from the fact that after playing five games in seven nights , their congested schedule has returned to normalcy they had tuesday off this last day away from the rink , the guys cleared their minds , vigneault said they came in this morning feeling good about themselves and the way they 're playing
i recently served 58 days of a threemonth sentence on rikers island i was convicted in may of assaulting a new york city police officer as the police cleared zuccotti park of occupy wall street protesters in 2012 \( i am appealing my conviction \) i got a firsthand experience that i did not seek of what it is like to live behind bars rikers is a city jail it holds some 11 , 000 inmates who are awaiting trial or sentencing , or who have been convicted and sentenced to a year or less of time during my incarceration , two on charges of smuggling contraband , including drugs , to inmates the week after i was released , two more on charges of having beaten a handcuffed prisoner into unconsciousness in 2012 last week , the new york times reported on the on rikers the city is now more than 100 reported violent assaults on inmates none of this would surprise the inmates of the rose m singer center , the women s barrack on the island , who routinely experience or witness brutality of all kinds on one day in may , i was waiting outside the jail pharmacy for my daily adhd prescription a male officer began harassing me , and when i made the mistake of looking at his badge to get his number , he slammed his body into mine and shouted a sexual slur at me i wrote up a complaint and then showed it to my lawyer , but he advised me not to file it , because of the risk of retaliation despite formal rules governing the interactions between correction officers and inmates that are detailed in the inmate handbook issued to everyone at intake , in reality we had no rights and no recourse in these kinds of conflicts violence is easy to grasp and to condemn what s harder to understand for people who have n't done time is the dayin , dayout degradation and neglect inmates are routinely denied basic medical treatment i saw a woman soiled with vomit and sobbing for hours we other inmates were afraid and concerned we did n't know what was happening , or what we could do finally , at the insistence of a few inmates , she was taken to the hospital she never came back her name was judith she had befriended me before she died i fear for my jailhouse madrina \( godmother \) , who remains on rikers for more than a month , she has been asking to get a biopsy of a lump in her throat , which she worries is a recurrence of the cancer she was treated for years ago and then there is the ritual humiliation of the inmates not physical death , but death of the soul our dorm was searched at least twice a month , and more often if the guards wanted to set an example two or three captains , and about 10 officers , male and female , would file into the dorm in full riot gear , wearing plexiglass masks and carrying big wooden bats another set of female officers filed into the bathroom and stood in a line facing the stalls , which lack doors we were ordered to lie down on our beds , face down , hands behind our backs a third set of female officers filed in they called us row by row into the bathroom , where we were ordered to strip naked , do a deep kneebend facing forward and another one facing backward , open our mouths , shake out our hair and lift up our breasts after we put our green jumpsuits back on , we were marched into the day room where we were ordered to stand facing the wall , sometimes for hours , while the dormitory was searched , the bedding flipped over , our personal possessions ransacked then a work detail of inmates went into the dormitory and swept all our unapproved belongings fruit , pens , extra blankets into trash bags the aftermath reminded me of what it was like to come home after a hurricane in southeast texas , where i grew up in the face of inhumanity , many of the women i shared quarters with were amazingly resilient and caring they looked after one another , and they looked after me in march , mayor bill de blasio appointed joseph ponte as the city s new correction commissioner by reputation , mr ponte , formerly the head of the department of corrections in maine , is a reformer he recently told times reporters that rikers island needed change to really bring it into the 21st century but he denied that rikers had a culture of violence i disagree fixing the prison system wo n't be quick or easy but in the short term , things could be done to improve conditions on rikers before i left , i asked the other inmates what changes they would make they had many ideas here are two upon intake , every inmate should receive a physical and psychological examination , as well as medication and treatment as needed \( i waited three weeks before receiving that daily prescription medication , which i had been taking before i was incarcerated \) while in jail , each prisoner should be guaranteed access to a doctor within 24 hours , as well as emergency medical help such action , i believe , could have saved judith s life and inmates need to be able to file grievances about mistreatment without fear of retaliation the rules governing ordinary interactions between inmates and correction officers , as well as the process for filing grievances , seem all too often to describe an alternate reality where interactions are calm , orderly and reasonably respectful but what i saw and experienced on rikers was far more chaotic and arbitrary yes , the women and men on rikers have been accused or convicted of crimes but that does not mean that they should be deprived of their basic rights to safety and care
kabul , afghanistan a of attacks in kabul has led several aid agencies to put their staff members on higher security alert , and some have sent foreign workers out of earlier than usual ahead of the holidays , aid officials say few agencies said they were planning permanent pullouts , however , and most emphasized that they were determined to keep working in the country despite an unusual series of 11 attacks during that period in the capital although the recent attacks have led to a new round of worrying about the future of western endeavors here , by some measures this year has been much less dangerous for foreign agencies and their staffs than the year before so far in 2014 , 36 aid workers have been killed and 95 wounded throughout afghanistan , compared with 44 killed and 167 wounded in 2013 , according to the an american governmentfunded project that tracks attacks on humanitarian workers worldwide while the 2014 figures have still not been verified , it is a substantial drop that said , afghanistan remains by far the most dangerous country in the world in which to be an aid worker of the 229 aid workers killed or injured worldwide so far this year , 95 were in afghanistan that as well in numbers of attacks on aid workers several of the 11 recent attacks were against foreign targets , including a private american aid contractor , south african aid workers , and armored vehicle the most recent attack , on saturday , killed three south africans with a littleknown aid group , a christian pastor and his teenage son and daughter , in karte seh , an area where many foreigners live taliban insurgents said they were secretly christian missionaries after that attack , several universities suspended classes , including the american university of afghanistan , and at least one high school catering to the children of expats did so as well the american university planned to reopen tuesday , an official said everyone s worried about it , and we 're all talking to each other about what to do , said the director of the high school , who asked not to be named so as not to identify his school as a possible target none of his foreign staff had left , however i heard that three or four ngos were pulling staff out , but was n't able to get names or confirmation , a united nations official said of nongovernmental organizations , speaking on condition of anonymity as a matter of policy i do know that people are getting nervous and some people are bringing their christmas holidays forward to go home earlier i know quite a few people who have done that the united nations has raised its alert status from green to gray in response to the latest attacks , meaning staff members were still going to their offices but were avoiding unnecessary travel outside the office , both in kabul and elsewhere , another united nations official said the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media about the precautions it s more tense than it was three weeks ago , the official said everybody knows that but our international officers , all of them are in town some businesses reportedly gave foreign employees the option of leaving the country early in response to the attacks , but there were no reports of any shutdowns departures of foreign passengers had increased recently , said mohammad yaqub rasuli , the head of the kabul international airport , but he said that was simply holidayrelated the increase in their number is normal as in every year and has nothing to do with the security situation , he said we 've taken some additional security precautions , said from the university of chicago , who works at the afghan national museum here but i do n't know anybody who s leaving a lot of my friends are actually staying for christmas this year it s a better safe than sorry' scenario , said the second united nations official but people are n't making any longterm decisions to leave , other than those who already did many foreign workers left afghanistan after a series of attacks early in the year , including a suicide attack on a popular restaurant , the taverna du liban , , most of them foreigners , including diplomats and aid workers some employers instituted strict restrictions on staff members' movements around kabul , which are mostly still in place restaurants catering to westerners are nearly empty most nights , and survive only by takeout and delivery business kabul has a large foreign community , with more foreign embassies than similarly small countries , numerous united nations agencies , and about 2 , 300 aid groups , many with international staff members more than 3 , 000 foreign aid workers are registered with the afghan government , and many others are unregistered through much of the afghan war , aid groups were largely immune to deliberate attacks by the insurgents but two factors seem to have changed that one has been the increased use by the american government and other foreign donors of private aid contractors in recent years , which blurred the lines between independent humanitarian groups and military or governmentaffiliated ones another has been the of insurgent attacks throughout the country
a few weeks ago , attorney general eric holder jr gave a speech at the new york university school of law in it , he offered a fullthroated defense of his department s efforts in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis with coming eight days later , one ca n't help but view his speech as a kind of valedictory the justice department , he said , had stood vigilant against financial fraud wherever it is uncovered and prosecuted criminal conduct to the fullest extent of the law he took credit for negotiating huge fines against financial firms , and for forcing several big banks credit suisse and bnp paribas to accept guilty pleas as for the prosecution of individuals involved in the financial crisis , he claimed that the justice department had taken aggressive action , nearly doubling the number of mortgage fraud indictments criminal convictions between 2009 and 2010 , then increasing them even further the following year actually , holder s justice department has been notoriously laggard in prosecuting crimes that stemmed from the financial crisis , and much of what it has done amounts to an exercise in public relations take , for instance , those guilty pleas extracted from credit suisse and bnp paribas last march , holder said that he feared that prosecuting large financial institutions could hurt the economy this became known as his too big to jail remark which he quickly disavowed no wonder he was eager to have some firms plead guilty ! yet , , the justice department made sure those guilty pleas did n't inflict too much pain in the case of bnp paribas , prosecutors secured agreements from state banking regulators that they would n't pull the bank s license to do business or take the claim that the justice department has been rigorously rooting out mortgage fraud in fact , after a grand announcement that the department was putting together a mortgage fraud task force , us attorneys around the country began aiming their fire at easy prey smalltime mortgage brokers , none of the top executives from any of the major firms were indicted indeed , according to only one executive of any kind a midlevel executive with credit suisse has gone to prison as a result of his actions during the financial crisis the notion that he s the only one who committed a crime in the mortgagecrazed runup to the financial crisis is , quite simply , implausible as for those big fines against bank of america , citigroup and jpmorgan chase , not only did they come very late , but their terms were such that it was impossible to know for sure the extent of their wrongdoing and , of course , despite fines that went into the billions , no actual human was prosecuted for any wrongdoing so the question worth asking , as holder plans to step down , is not what his department did but why it did so little why was it so reluctant to pursue the financial crimes connected to the 2008 crisis \? one answer is that these are hard cases to prosecute harder than negotiating a financial settlement with a big bank early on , the justice department tried two bear stearns portfolio managers whose hedge fund stuffed with mortgagebacked securities collapsed the two men were found innocent that verdict seems to have sent a chill through prosecutors , making them reluctant to go after others jesse eisinger , the author of that times magazine article , wrote that , over the years , the justice department saw an erosion of the department s actual trial skills , as well as a drop in resources in the southern district of new york , us attorney preet bharara focused with great success on insidertrading cases , where he had wiretaps that made prosecutions relatively easy , instead of difficulttotry financial crisis cases adam levitin , a professor at georgetown law school , had his own list of reasons , which he emailed me they included fear that the obama administration would be accused of an antibusiness witch hunt if it went after wall street deep personal , cultural , financial and political ties between the administration and wall street and a lack of understanding of the products and markets involved what it all boils down to , levitin concluded , is that we did n't have prosecutions because no one ever really wanted to prosecute holder s legacy is a mixed bag as the times s matt apuzzo , he succeeded in reducing lengthy prison sentences , opened civil rights investigations against police departments in record numbers and challenged identification requirements for voters on the negative side , he subpoenaed journalists and went after their sources no matter how he tries to spin it , holder s inability or unwillingness to prosecute financial crimes is on the negative side of the ledger
rafael nadal would make an excellent stone cutter he is incredibly gifted at first finding a crack and then unceasingly hammering away at it until he finally breaks the stone in victory this was essentially the story line of nadal s 76 \( 4 \) , 63 , 63 victory over roger federer in the semifinals of the australian open in melbourne on friday night it was close early , but the monotonous , repetitive nature of nadal s game plan opened holes all over the court in federer s flashy but inconsistent game nadal pounded away at federer s backhand with his serve and extracted an avalanche of errors from federer s forehand holes that other players fail to find in federer s game have always seemed easy for nadal to expose surprisingly , nadal s dominance over federer is built from running fewer patterns of play , not more time and time again we all knew , including federer , where nadal was going to hit the ball , but there was nothing federer could do from slipping further behind in the rally when federer is going for winners early in the point , which started around the middle of the second set , then the noose is tightening the most obvious of nadal s simple strategies is his serve direction he made 56 first serves for the match and pinpointed 52 \( 92 percent \) to federer s backhand nadal has been doing that for years , and it is remarkable federer has not figured out a way to counter this tactic you could almost imagine nadal yelling over the net on rod laver arena , telling federer where the serve was going to go , but federer still managing to lose the point federer won only 28 percent \( 15 of 52 \) of points beginning with a backhand return off a first serve , and none of four directed to his forehand what leaves you shaking your head is that federer coughed up 19 backhand return errors for the match , even though it was obvious where the serve was going to go nadal committed 11 backhand return errors nadal and federer last played each other on an outdoor hardcourt last summer in the quarterfinals of the cincinnati masters nadal won , 57 , 64 , 63 he directed a healthy 87 percent \( 57 of 65 \) of first serves to federer s backhand in that match , with federer winning 24 percent \( 14 of 57 \) but only committing 6 backhand return errors in cincinnati , federer sliced 43 percent of his backhand returns \( 25 of 57 \) in melbourne he sliced only 11 percent \( 6 of 51 \) in an apparent effort to be more offensive to begin the point but federer is missing the point it s not how he hits it , but where that matters more nadal is always prowling for a forehand as his first shot after the serve , and friday s semifinal was true to form nadal hit a forehand after a serve 72 percent of the time , winning 73 percent of those points it s the most lethal onetwo combination in the sport , and federer ca n't stop it in cincinnati , nadal hit a serve and a forehand 75 percent of the time , winning 70 percent of those points those kinds of numbers define a career and create a legend federer s second major hole in the semifinal was his forehand he needed it to be his biggest weapon , but it was his biggest weakness federer had 30 forehand errors , the most for a ground stroke on either side of the net federer hit 13 forehand winners to nadal s 9 , but only two came in the opening set , seven in the second set and four in the last set the horse had already bolted twenty of federer s forehand errors were committed in the deuce court , where nadal often had federer running hard to hit his forehand defensively under great pressure federer s third big hole for the match was approaching he won only 16 of 35 net points his determination to attack was commendable , but the strategy behind it was doomed from the beginning federer dominated approaching to nadal s backhand as expected , but he was repeatedly crushed when approaching to nadal s wicked heavy topspin forehand federer won 14 of 19 points approaching to nadal s backhand , so why did n't he do it more \? while the match looked close at the beginning , the pressure was silently building as federer searched in vain for holes in nadal s game for federer to beat nadal in such an important occasion , he needed to win the first set and apply scoreboard pressure , hit rocksolid backhand returns back to nadal s backhand , and stop approaching to nadal s forehand that will at least get him on a level playing field stefan edberg , federer s new coach , will be pleased with an inform run to the semifinals , but nadal is simply a different animal , someone who exposes all the current warts in federer s game
the islamic state has visibly attracted young muslims from all over the world to its violent movement to build a caliphate in iraq and syria but here s what s less visible the online backlash against the islamic state , also known as isis and isil , by young muslims declaring their opposition to rule by islamic law , or shariah , and even proudly avowing their atheism nadia oweidat , a senior fellow at the new america foundation , who tracks how arab youths use the internet , says the phenomenon is mushrooming the brutality of the islamic state is exacerbating the issue and even pushing some young muslims away from islam on nov 24 , on what was trending on twitter it began a growing social media conversation in arabic is calling for the implementation of shariah , or islamic law , to be abandoned discussing religious law is a sensitive topic in many muslim countries but on twitter , a hashtag which translates as why we reject implementing shariah' has been used 5 , 000 times in 24 hours the conversation is mainly taking place in saudi arabia and egypt the debate is about whether religious law is suitable for the needs of arab countries and modern legal systems dr alyaa gad , an egyptian doctor living in switzerland , started the hashtag i have nothing against religion , ' she tells bbc trending , but says she is against using it as a political system' the bbc added that many others joined in the conversation , using the hashtag , listing reasons why arabs and muslims should abandon shariah because there s not a single positive example of it bringing justice and equality , ' one man tweeted a saudi woman commented by adhering to shariah we are adhering to inhumane laws saudi arabia is saturated with the blood of those executed by sharia' ismail mohamed , an egyptian on a mission to create freedom of conscience there , started a program called to offer a space where agnostic and atheist arabs can speak freely about their right to choose what they believe and resist coercion and misogyny from religious authorities he is part of a growing for arab news written by arabs that gets right in the face of autocrats and religious extremists also check out  another voice getting attention is brother rachid , a moroccan who created to deliver his message of tolerance and to expose examples of intolerance within his former muslim faith community \( he told me he s converted to christianity , preferring its god of love \) in , which has been viewed 500 , 000 times , brother rachid addressed president obama dear mr president , i must tell you that you are wrong about isil you said isil speaks for no religion i am a former muslim my dad is an imam i have spent more than 20 years studying islam i can tell you with confidence that isil speaks for islam isil s 10 , 000 members are all muslims they come from different countries and have one common denominator islam they are following islam s prophet muhammad in every detail they have called for a caliphate , which is a central doctrine in sunni islam he continued i ask you , mr president , to stop being politically correct to call things by their names isil , al qaeda , boko haram , al shabab in somalia , the taliban , and their sister brand names , are all made in islam unless the muslim world deals with islam and separates religion from state , we will never end this cycle if islam is not the problem , then why is it there are millions of christians in the middle east and yet none of them has ever blown up himself to become a martyr , even though they live under the same economic and political circumstances and even worse \? mr president , if you really want to fight terrorism , then fight it at the roots how many saudi sheikhs are preaching hatred \? how many islamic channels are indoctrinating people and teaching them violence from the quran and the hadith \? how many islamic schools are producing generations of teachers and students who believe in jihad and martyrdom and fighting the infidels \? isis , by claiming to speak for all muslims and by promoting a puritanical form of islam that takes presentday , saudifunded , madrassa indoctrination to its logical political conclusion has blown the lid off some long simmering frustrations in the arab muslim world as an outsider , i ca n't say how widespread this is but clearly there is a significant group of muslims who feel that their governmentbacked preachers and religious hierarchies have handed them a brand of islam that does not speak to them these same authorities have also denied them the critical thinking tools and religious space to imagine new interpretations so a few , like brother rachid , leave islam for a different faith and invite others to come along and some seem to be quietly detaching from religion entirely fed up with being patronized by politically correct westerners telling them and with being tyrannized by selfappointed islamist authoritarians telling them now that the internet has created free , safe , alternative spaces and platforms to discuss these issues , outside the mosques and governmentowned media , this war of ideas is on
at this point in the great inflationdeflation debate , a lot of what the inflationistas have to say takes the form of whining about the rudeness of their critics of course , me in particular i would say that this is a de facto confession that they ve run out of substantive defenses for their position although i guess i would say that , wouldn t i \? but there s something else you should know the inflation derpers aren t just ignorant about monetary policy , they also don t understand the rules of argument in particular , the constant complaint about ad hominem attacks shows that they don t know what that means i think the wikipedia definition is pretty good an ad hominem is a form of criticism directed at something about the person one is criticizing , rather than something \( potentially , at least \) independent of that person so if , for example , somebody discussing my views on monetary policy refers to me as enron consultant paul krugman , that s ad hominem but if i say that inflationistas have been bobbing and weaving , refusing to acknowledge having said what they said , being completely unwilling to admit mistakes that s really not ad hominem i m attacking how these people argue , not their personal attributes what about the lexicon we ve developed over the course of the past few years zombies , cockroaches , confidence fairies , derp \? these are all terms directed at arguments , not people no , i didn t call olli rehn a cockroach , just his historically ignorant assertion that keynes wouldn t have called for fiscal stimulus in the face of high debt the point is that at no point , as far as i know , have i relied on personal attacks as a substitute for substantive argument i never accuse someone of practicing derp without showing that he is , indeed , practicing derp still , why use such colorful language \? to get peoples attention , of course , and to highlight the sheer scale of the folly and it s working , isn t it \? now , the people who make zombie arguments and engage in derp feel deeply insulted by all of this but if you re going to engage in public debate , with very real policy concerns that affect the lives of millions at stake , you are not entitled to have your arguments treated with respect unless they deserve respect one more thing i also don t think that the derp brigade understands what it means to argue from authority when i say that you shouldn t opine on monetary policy unless you re willing to invest some time on understanding the monetary debate , i am saying exactly that i m not saying that you need a phd or a chair at a fancy university i m saying that you need to do your homework in a better world , none of this would be relevant policy disputes would be based on defensible , wellinformed positions , on which reasonable people could disagree , and people who were proved wrong would acknowledge that fact and revise their views also , everyone would get a pony
indianapolis coach mike woodson expected that the would need to play what he called a perfect game to compete with the on thursday night what woodson got from his team was not the dream scenario far from it , in fact we were awful , he said , adding , it was a total team disaster the pacers showcased their muscle , quickness and confidence in at bankers life fieldhouse it was another indication of the gap between these two teams , a gap that has become a gulf since they met last season in the eastern conference semifinals the pacers \( 317 \) were led by lance stephenson , who scored a careerhigh 28 points and punctuated nearly every one of his baskets with words or gestures , sometimes both in the fourth quarter , he stripped j r smith at midcourt and accelerated for an upandunder layup , drawing a foul for good measure stephenson , who grew up in brooklyn , proceeded to pose in front of the knicks' bench what could they do but watch \? the pacers' lead was 28 you can do it when you 're winning , tyson chandler said , adding that it was the knicks' job to keep him from doing all that carmelo anthony scored 28 points but did not play in the fourth quarter , the pacers having left little doubt of the outcome amar'e stoudemire and kenyon martin were spared the trauma of watching the final minutes they were already in the locker room with sprained left ankles both could be sidelined for several games we got to suck it up , woodson said , and the guys who are in uniform , they got to step up and start playing the knicks \( 1524 \) were left with little to feel good about , except for what was ahead an eightgame homestand , starting friday against the los angeles clippers it was an embarrassing loss , man , anthony said there s no way i believe they 're 30 points better than we are i refuse to accept that the halftime entertainment featured frisbeecatching dogs , but even they were outclassed by the pacers , who led by 15 at halftime , shot 50 percent from the field and remained indomitable at home , improving to a leaguebest 201 there this season paul george had 25 points in the win this is a tough team and a tough place to play , raymond felton said but still , no excuses anthony cited a lack of adjustments , adding that the pacers outworked the knicks by diving for loose balls and grabbing offensive rebounds stoudemire mentioned gamelong lapses we pick and choose what nights we want to bring our focus , he said speaking of which , whenever the knicks are available for public inspection these days , simultaneous events seem to occur there is the actual game , of course and then there is smith , whose behavior has incurred the wrath of the league \( which has fined him \) and his coach \( who has benched him \) the knicks would be a captivating sociological study even without smith s antics but when he tugs at opponents' shoelaces , flirts with the dangers of social media and vows to cut off communication with woodson well , the knicks produce a script worthy of a telenovela against the pacers , smith was back in the rotation , if not entirely in woodson s good graces he was little more than background noise , and perhaps that was a small victory on a night when everything else went wrong smith finished with 12 points in 28 minutes whenever i play , i'm satisfied , smith said if i do n't play , i just got to keep working to make sure i do play it was the knicks' first trip to indianapolis since the pacers ousted them from the playoffs last season before thursday s game , anthony said the ill effects from that series continued to linger woodson summed it up this way bad feelings his words seemed appropriate stephenson , who was 10 of 17 from the field , was a vocal presence from the opening minutes after he streaked to the hoop for an acrobatic layup , he yelped at the knicks' bench as he retreated on defense that s east coast basketball , smith said anthony settled into an early rhythm of his own he scored 18 points in the first quarter , but the pacers refused to budge despite anthony s pyrotechnics , the knicks were able to build only a 3130 lead for woodson , this was one cause for concern another was martin , who aggravated his troublesome left ankle in the second quarter another was stoudemire , who landed awkwardly in the third quarter and declined to put a timetable on his return another was tim hardaway jr , who sprained his left wrist none of this should have come as a great surprise what was another knicks game without an injury or three \? the pacers found separation before halftime luis scola snapped a tie with a 3pointer , and indiana continued to pour it on george drained a 3pointer that led to an ineffectual timeout by woodson the knicks' offense , highoctane in recent weeks , was stuck in neutral , and stayed there rebounds pablo prigioni , who has not played since dec 16 because of a broken toe , participated in pregame shooting drills and could make his return friday against the clippers
when my husband and i uprooted our 11yearold son and 8yearold daughter to move to nashville from atlanta , we timed it to happen over the summer we thought it would be easier to handle the moverelated chaos in a season when everything s a little more laid back can t find the box with sheets and pillows in it \? that s ok there s no rush on bedtime don t have an oven in the kitchen yet \? no problem let s throw something on the grill and eat outside summer was , indeed , a perfect time to explore our new surroundings we could go for a hike on a weekday morning , lie around reading in the afternoon we went to concerts , parks and movies , and tried all our neighborhood sandwich shops and ice cream parlors for the first couple of months , nashville was one big vacation and for those two months , not once did my children say they missed atlanta then summer ended , and reality kicked in my children , like most , have never been wild about getting pulled out of bed before they re fully awake they have never liked having to stop playing to take a shower or brush their teeth they ve always dragged their feet when it s time to put on shoes or jackets or whatever else prevents them from running free and barefoot and barely clothed through the world the way they want to none of that is news but all of a sudden the things they ve always disliked have been reframed as new complaints with a recurrent theme when told to put on a raincoat , they curse nashville for not being sunny enough when reminded to study , they say their new school has too many tests when asked to pick up the piles of legos on the stairs , they break down i hate this house ! to quote the song by passenger you only need the light when it s burning low only miss the sun when it starts to snow only miss your old room when you have to clean your new room \( some editorial license exercised on that third line \) what the children are now experiencing is what we adults already know when you move , you take more than just your stuff with you you take yourself you take all your likes , dislikes , hangups , hopes and problems , and you place them in a new and unfamiliar setting summer was all about sleeping in , chilling out and having popsicles for breakfast if we wanted to the annual letdown of saying goodbye to all that and hello to the weekday grind has everyone at our house a little tired and thechildren longing for comfort and what s more comforting than familiarity \? it makes sense the more stressed they feel , the more they desire the familiar and the old without those comforts to soothe their anxiety , the stress builds , and it comes out in uncharacteristic outbursts over small things i m hopeful that this phase will pass before too long \( it will pass , right \? \) , but it s tough to watch when this happens when , say , a child falls into a tearful fit over not being able to find a particular pair of socks it s a good reminder for me that they are still little they haven t moved a dozen times like i have they don t have a lifetime of practice rolling with the changes and powering through uncomfortable situations they re gaining some of that now , and that resilience will serve them well , i hope but they could also use a little comfort in the meantime , a little break now and then maybe we ll have popsicles for breakfast on saturday mary laura philpott is a writer living \( as of just recently \) in nashville she is the editor of for parnassus books , and her next book , will be published by perigee books , an imprint of penguin random house , next year she will be writing about her family s transition to new schools and a new life in nashville in new in town through october 2014
baghdad whether a person is a shiite or a sunni muslim in can now be , quite literally , a matter of life and death as the militant group the , or isis , has seized vast territories in western and northern iraq , there have been frequent accounts of fighters' capturing groups of people and releasing the sunnis while the shiites are singled out for execution isis believes that the shiites are apostates and must die in order to forge a pure form of islam the two main branches of islam diverge in their beliefs over who is the true inheritor of the mantle of the prophet muhammad the shiites believe that islam was transmitted through the household of the prophet muhammad sunnis believe that it comes down through followers of the prophet muhammad who , they say , are his chosen people but how can isis tell whether a person is a sunni or a shiite \? from accounts of people who survived encounters with the militants , it seems they often ask a list of questions here are some of them a quick look at an iraqi s national identity card or passport can be a signal shiites believe that the leadership of islam was passed down through the prophet muhammad s soninlaw ali and his sons hussain \( or hussein \) , hassan and abbas , among others while some sunnis and members of other islamic groups may also have those names , isis would most likely associate them with the shiites in every city and province , even majority sunni ones , there are enclaves that are known to be shiite people who said they came from one of those neighborhoods would most likely be killed shiites and sunnis offer prayers in slightly different ways , with sunnis generally folding their hands or crossing their arms in front of their stomachs and shiites leaving them extended , palms resting on their thighs in a chilling video that appeared to have been made more than a year ago in the anbar province of iraq , isis fighters stopped three truck drivers in the desert and asked them whether they were sunnis or shiites all three claimed to be sunni then the questions got harder they were asked how they performed each of the prayers morning , midday and evening the truck drivers disagreed on their methods , and all were shot recordings of religious songs could also be a tipoff similarly , even the ringtone on a person s telephone could be a clue because it might be from a sunni or shiite religious song there are other clues , but none are completely reliable for instance , a number of shiites wear large rings , often with semiprecious stones but so do some sunnis , and others generally , iraqi shiites and sunnis are often indistinguishable in appearance that is even more evident in many families and tribes in which there has been intermarriage for generations given that the rigid views of isis are fairly well known , it is perhaps natural to wonder why hostages do not simply lie about their origins it seems that many do , yet in very tense , perilous encounters , people can easily get tripped up sometimes another person in a group might inadvertently give someone away others refuse to lie about their faith
westminster , mass the fury and make no mistake , it is whitehot fury went way beyond the ordinary wrath of offended citizenry a plan here to ban the sale of tobacco has ignited a call to arms the outrage is aimed at a proposal by the local board of health that could make westminster the first town in the country where no one could buy cigarettes , ecigarettes , cigars and chewing tobacco the uproar stems not from a desire by people here to smoke only 17 percent do \( a smidge higher than the statewide average \) many say they have never touched tobacco and find the habit disgusting rather , they perceive the ban as a frontal assault on their individual liberties and they say it would cripple the eight retailers in town who sell tobacco products the ban is the major topic at vincent s country store , where a petition against it sits on the front counter and attracts more signatures every day at last count , 1 , 200 people had signed , in a town of 7 , 400 as shoppers come and go , they feed one another s fury they 're just taking away everyday freedoms , little by little , said nate johnson , 32 , an egg farmer who also works in an auto body shop , as he stood outside the store last week this is n't about tobacco , it s about control , he said it s unamerican , put in rick sparrow , 48 , a house painter as wayne and deborah hancock grabbed a shopping cart , they joined in all quickly agreed that the next freedoms at risk would be guns and religion , prompting mrs hancock , 52 , a homemaker , to say that she was afraid to wear her cross i'm thinking , am i going to be beheaded \? ' she said , not entirely joking nearly 500 people packed a hearing at a local elementary school on wednesday night held by the three members of the board of health passions ran high , and the hearing became so unruly that the board chairwoman could not maintain order she shut down the hearing 20 minutes after it began the crowd started singing god bless america in protest as the board members left under police protection angry residents circulated petitions demanding a recall election for the board members few can fathom how westminster became the latest setting for the nation s decadesold tobacco wars the prerevolutionary settlement emerged as a stagecoach stop in the late 1700s between boston , 50 miles away , and points west it remains largely rural and votes heavily republican there is no industry here , not even a mall opponents of the ban blame outside groups that want to make the town a test case , conjecturing that because it is so small , no one would care in fact , the board of health has been discussing the ban since the spring but no one noticed until the board notified merchants last month that they could lose their permits to sell tobacco david b sutton , a spokesman for altria , the parent company of philip morris , the nation s biggest tobacco company , said the company was monitoring the situation but had not been involved or stoked the rebellion tobacco accounts for only a fraction of total revenue at the stores here that sell it but people who buy cigarettes and cigars also buy other things , and studies say that losing those customers can cost stores a third of their revenue the name of the game is onestop shopping , said joe serio , the owner and pharmacist at the brownshingled westminster pharmacy , where tobacco sales are 2 percent of revenues , and where wine and beer are stocked next to the cramped aisles of bandaids and antacids over the years , massachusetts has banned smoking in workplaces , as well as in restaurants and bars and most of the state s 351 cities and towns have enacted their own restrictions for example , 105 towns have banned tobacco sales in health care institutions , including pharmacies 34 have raised the legal age for buying cigarettes to 21 from 18 eight have banned the sale of flavored tobacco products and ecigarettes but westminster would be the first in the state and nation with a fullblown ban on selling all tobacco and products the idea originated with the board of health , which says it has a moral obligation to try to stop young people from smoking the board found it hard to keep up with all the new products , like bubblegumflavored cigars and strawberrymargaritaflavored tobacco , many of them aimed at hooking young people we have a whacka effect , joan hamlett , the town s tobacco control agent , said at the hearing wednesday night before it was cut short every 18 months since 1994 , this westminster board of health has been looking at different regulations because every time we work together to find a way to reduce youth access to tobacco , the tobacco industry comes out with a new product that we have to look at and address and figure out how to regulate andrea crete , chairwoman of the board of health , quoting a report from the surgeon general , said that youth who shop at least twice a week in stores that sell tobacco are 64 percent more likely to start smoking than those who do not the board of health permitting these establishments to sell these dangerous products that , when used as directed , kill 50 percent of its users , ethically goes against our public health mission , ms crete said the crowd listened , but once the hearing was opened for public comment , people began to hoot and holler you people make me sick , one man growled at the board as the audience cheered wayne r walker , a town selectman , said that the selectmen had voted unanimously to oppose the ban i detest smoking and tobacco in all its forms , he told the health board , but such a unilateral and radical approach as banning all sales would create a significant economic hardship a resident named kevin west said that smoking was one of the most disgusting habits anybody could possibly do , but added i find this proposal to be even more of a disgusting thing the shouts after his statement prompted ms crete , who had issued several warnings , to declare the hearing over she said that people could submit their views in writing until dec 1 the board , which has final say on the ban , will schedule another meeting and vote on the proposal , but she did not know when as angry citizens milled about after the aborted hearing , brian vincent , who owns vincent s country store , said he was disappointed he did not have a chance to tell the board that none of the merchants in town sell the kind of cheap , sweet tobacco products that the board is worried about and none have been found in the last two years with underage sales violations among the hundreds of protesters at the hearing , at least two people doctors supported the ban dr corey saltin and dr payam aghassi , lung specialists who have a private practice nearby , said that they understood concerns about free choice but that people who are subjected to secondhand smoke have rights , too this ban is going to happen somewhere , sometime , dr saltin predicted but probably not in westminster
the thought of colleges bidding , maybe even with cash , for the services of the best football and basketball prospects would make most university presidents blush but that is what could happen if jeffrey kessler gets his way kessler , a 60yearold lawyer from brooklyn , had a big hand in bringing free agency to the nfl and the nba and now he is turning his focus to the ncaa a lawsuit filed by kessler and his associates from the winston strawn law firm earlier this year argues that the ncaa and its partners have engaged in antitrust violations by limiting how football and basketball players are compensated the case seeks to remove the restrictions on remuneration for those athletes , allowing for an open market to take hold where universities can decide what they want to offer recruits the ncaa has hired top lawyers to contest the suit , which is pending , with a trial coming as soon as the fall of 2015 in an interview , kessler explained his case and how the future world of college sports might look if he is successful our case is directed specifically at the core restrictions that prevent schools from deciding for themselves how they want to treat their players what we are seeking to do is remove the shackles so that the schools can decide themselves what is the fair and appropriate way to take care to their players if you have a school like texas that earns close to 200 million for their football or basketball programs , you might decide it is fair to give some of that to the players who are generating the money once you are no longer stopped from doing so this is a case to give the schools freedom to decide how to fairly treat their players , to give the players freedom to get some value for what they contribute to these schools for many of these players who will never go on to the pros , this is their only chance to realize value for what they contribute and i think ultimately it is going to be a liberating case for those who are fans of those sports as well because what we 've seen is whenever more competition has been added in the player markets , whether it has been in the nfl or the nba or major league baseball , every single time the game has gotten better , fan interest has increased and competition has proven to be a good thing for everybody what they 'd like to do is turn back the clock and not have the schools running their own cable television networks , not having the schools earning all this money , not having the head coaches making 6 million or more they want to go back to a world where there were n't two gigantic businesses being run in football and basketball by those schools who run it we are dealing with the real world the real world is that none of that is likely to ever change the money is only getting bigger the market should decide what s the result if a school wants to offer 5 , 000 a year to their players , they can do that and if another school wants to offer a different number , they can do that someone might say , let s put it in a trust fund someone else might say , i'm going to pay through increased health benefits or insurance someone else might say , i'm going to give you enhanced scholarships that s what markets decide the players wo n't get one dollar more than the markets decide they are worth schools will make different decisions some schools will not want to do this at all the ivy league does n't offer athletic scholarships that s not going to change the idea here is , let schools decide , let s not have a cartel decide that s what s illegal they have to hire intelligent people , who make good decisions , who spend within their means if there are schools spending more than they can afford in athletics , they may also be spending more than they can afford on the history department or some other aspect of their school a right now , the spending by the schools on men s basketball and football at every single institution dwarfs the spending at all of the women s sports combined no one says that s a title ix violation because title ix does n't speak to equal spending there s been a lot of use of title ix as a kind of bogeyman , that just like the ncaa likes to say we ca n't treat the athletes fairly in these two sports because of amateurism or we ca n't treat them fairly because of competitive balance , so we ca n't treat them fairly because they are students i do n't think it will be the same as professional sports here s why the reason why college sports is unique is not because of this myth of amateurism it is because players are playing for their schools people have an affinity for their schools or a rooting interest in those schools , and that is different there will always be that great attraction of college sports because people will root for michigan or notre dame or texas or whatever their school might be that s going to stay that s really what distinguishes college sports , i think , from the professional sports we have been confident from the beginning that our case is the right case , and that ultimately we hope and expect to prevail as time goes on , and as other decisions come down , they only make us feel more confident about the ultimate outcome i 'd like to see the ncaa do more for player safety that s clearly a role they can play there is nothing approaching a balance today all you have to do is look at who are the top15 teams every year and who wins the bowl championship series and which conferences dominate alabama could have the best coaches and the best facilities and the best promotion and they go out by the way and get the best players does anyone think the university of delaware is competing for the same football players as alabama \? it is not even a close question
maple heights , ohio the population of this workingclass cleveland suburb has gone from nearly all white to twothirds black since its mayor declared more than 35 years ago that he did not know what a minority is but its police and fire departments have not kept pace the maple heights police force today still has only two black officers out of 35 the fire department is 100 percent white maple heights is far from unique across the country , police departments still struggle to hire and retain minority candidates in some cases despite great efforts , in others because of a lack of initiative but now , the problem has taken on new relevance since the fatal shooting of a young black man last month in ferguson , mo , where just four of the 53 police officers are black , according to the police chief nationwide , the total number of minority police officers has risen , but they remain heavily concentrated in larger cities , with the numbers falling off sharply in smaller ones , like ferguson and maple heights data from a federal survey of police departments in 2007 , analyzed for the new york times by andrew a beveridge , a sociologist at queens college , found that nearly 400 departments , most with fewer than a hundred officers , were substantially whiter than the populations they served in these departments , the share of white officers was greater than the share of white residents by more than 50 percentage points ferguson and maple heights are about the same size , just over 20 , 000 people , and in both , the black population has surged in recent decades both cities have white mayors and largely white political leaderships and both police departments have fallen far short of reflecting the communities they serve even as some of maple heights s neighboring police departments have achieved much higher levels of diversity critics point to the lack of racial balance in police departments as evidence of systemic racism but experts say the experiences of the two towns illustrate the obstacles to achieving diversity in law enforcement , even for departments that have made it a priority i see all these pundits come on the sunday talk shows and say of course you can hire more black people of course they 're not trying , ' said nelson lim , a senior sociologist at the rand corporation s center on quality policing who has consulted with departments in los angeles and san diego but it s very , very , very difficult there is little hard evidence that diversity correlates with better performance , in part because it is difficult to control for complex variables and to know which outcomes , from crime rates to brutality cases , to measure in fact , of a florida police department found that black officers were more likely than white to use force against black suspects a review of court cases going back to the early 1990s revealed only a handful of civil rights or excessiveforce cases against the maple heights police , two of which involved a white officer who is no longer with the department , and none that involved a fatality like the shooting in ferguson still , it is an accepted tenet of community policing that when departments reflect the communities they serve , they have an easier time building trust and defusing , rather than escalating , tense situations in maple heights , some residents said they would like to see more black officers , while others said that it was the attitude , experience and training of the officer , not race , that mattered chris turney , a home renovator who lives with his wife and two daughters , said it was more important for officers to live in the city all but one do not the police come here , they do their jobs , they do n't try to get to know anybody , said mr turney , who is black the police do n't wave other residents drew a contrast between police attitudes in maple heights and neighboring bedford heights , where threequarters of the residents , and nine of 28 police officers , are black bedford s not going to do you like maple , said carlos walker , 41 , who is black you have to do something real stupid for bedford maple , soon as they get behind you , you sweating in her 11 years as an officer in bedford heights , detective ericka payne , who is black , has often provided backup on calls in maple heights there are definitely differences in the ways the departments interact with the outside community , detective payne said we try to be a little bit more community oriented because we are a little bit more diverse , we understand those dynamics and maybe have a little bit more ease dealing with that several maple heights officials said the diversity of the police and fire departments had never been a major issue it is hard to find qualified candidates of any race , said john c popielarczyk , who has been with the maple heights police department since 1990 and the acting police chief since may maple heights , , has fallen on hard times , and the police force has shrunk and with most officers staying on the job for 25 years , chief popielarczyk said , the opportunity to hire is scarce of eight recent hires , two were black one , the chief said , was fired for cause before his probationary period ended the department has advertised in minority newspapers and changed the private company that administers its civil service exam in hopes that more minority candidates would pass , he said but he added the real goal of the department is to provide qualified officers who are competent and can provide quality service regardless of race i do n't think people really care about the color of the officer that responds they care that the officer responds quickly , is effective , treats them well and is respectful the acting fire chief , james castelucci , said much the same , adding that one promising black candidate withdrew when his current employer offered him more money the obstacles to diversity are many , dr lim , the sociologist , said candidates usually must pass written tests , physical agility tests , psychological tests , polygraphs and background checks , some of which can have a disparate impact on minority candidates qualified black candidates are sought after not just by competing police departments , but also by employers in other industries and some police chiefs have cited a negative attitude toward law enforcement among blacks that hinders recruiting police departments have tried all kinds of remedies , from personal trainers to help with physical fitness tests to tailored recruiting \( a rand survey found that women were attracted to the good salaries in policing , blacks to the profession s prestige and asians to the excitement of the job \) but many small departments lack the resources , or the will , to conduct an exhaustive review of their hiring practices in maple heights , job candidates are ranked by how well they score on the written exam , earning bonus points for factors like previous training , military experience and city residency for each opening , the candidates are considered one by one , in order of their score some nearby suburbs like bedford heights and cleveland heights where about 40 percent of the residents and 22 of 102 officers are black do things differently the chiefs of both departments said officials were allowed to consider the top 10 candidates on the list , which helps them hire more minority candidates both chiefs said their cities took an aggressive approach to diversity as early as the 1970s cleveland heights has two types of officer positions , one that requires a civil service exam and a college degree , and a lower tier , called basic patrol , that does not once a basic patrol officer is hired , the city will reimburse tuition costs , and many eventually earn a degree and work their way to the upper tier the diversity of neighboring police departments poses a challenge to cities like maple heights , dr lim said if the leadership , if the police chief , is dedicated to getting more diversity in the work force , how hard is it to figure out how the other department is doing such a good job \? asked why maple heights considered only one candidate at a time , chief popielarczyk said we 've always done it that way my understanding is that that s how we 're supposed to do it some maple heights residents have tried to persuade the city to hire more blacks , forming a committee called the maple heights citizens for change in 2012 , elaine stone , a committee member who runs a blog called the , was digging around and discovered a longforgotten affirmative action agreement , signed by the mayor , a citizens' committee and a representative from the federal justice department in 1977 in that deal , maple heights , at the time about 96 percent white , agreed that within three years minorities would make up at least 4 percent of its police and fire departments but it soon became clear that the city was less than fully committed to this goal i figure we 're all minorities , the mayor at the time , emil j lisy jr , told reporters when he was criticized for failing to live up to the agreement the first thing is to find out what a minority is , and i have n't figured that out federal officials threatened to withhold 500 , 000 in funds , but backed down after the mayor submitted a 65page response when ms stone learned about the agreement , she contacted frank ross , the only surviving signer of the document mr ross was a teacher in his 20s when he came to maple heights , at a time when real estate brokers steered black customers to a part of town called presidential row he now lives 12 miles away , but agreed to go to meetings of the committee , where he suggested that the group call the community relations service of the justice department , the same office that helped broker the earlier deal though new discussions were opened between the city and the service , which provides mediation and training to governments , residents feel the talks have stalled neither the mayor nor the maple heights legal director returned calls for comment for this article , and the service does not publicly discuss its work participation by local governments is strictly voluntary ms stone said economics , not overt racism , had kept the police and fire departments largely white there was white flight , but people were trying to hold on to their jobs , she said i can understand you do n't want to give up that job mr ross said apathy among black voters was partly to blame for the situation but he does not accept the city s excuses they 're telling me in 40 years they ca n't find any africanamerican policemen \? he said forty years later it s very emotional for me forty years later , i'm still dealing with the same thing
donetsk , ukraine ukraine pressed ahead on sunday with its military assault to stamp out prorussian separatists in the east of the country with its most intensive artillery bombardment of this rebel capital yet the attack with artillery and groundtoground rockets defied russian threats to intervene here as the civilian death toll rose it also reinforced the ukrainian leadership s rejection of a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds offered on saturday by the head of the main prorussian separatist group here , the donetsk people s republic the separatist leadership clarified sunday that the ceasefire offer had covered only socalled green routes , or roads used by evacuees still , ukraine s outright rebuff of the proposal only added to concerns that russia would intervene with what the authorities in moscow are calling a humanitarian mission but what european nations and the united states would view as an invasion , analysts said secretary of state john kerry has against intervening on the pretext of providing aid through the day on sunday , artillery shells rained down on three districts of donetsk , hitting a rebel checkpoint and leaving it swathed in smoke , but also striking houses , apartment buildings and the maternity ward of the city s main hospital shells killed at least one civilian in the city roma pronyakin , 37 , was at home with his mother , watching tv , when their living room was struck his mother , alla , stood on the road in a state of shock i had one son , and now i have none , she said a proukrainian paramilitary group called the azov battalion , one of a halfdozen such organizations positioned around the city and used for urban combat , said sunday that its fighters had raided the ilovaisky district of the city , but pulled back the ukrainian military said it had engaged in 30 firefights with the prorussian separatists in the previous 24 hours the terrorists who are still active in donetsk and luhansk regions should lay down their arms and not bring up empty conversations about ceasefires , a ukrainian military spokesman said in kiev , according to ukrinform , the state news agency if they want to take initiative , it is realized in a practical way , not with words , but by raising a white flag and laying down arms , the spokesman said in this case , nobody will shoot the terrorists the city s main hospital , known as hospital no 1 , was struck sunday by artillery fire for a second time in recent days it has the misfortune of falling right in the center of a line of fire between ukrainian positions outside the city and the rebel military headquarters in the previous strike on the hospital , on thursday , shells hit the dental ward , , destroying a pediatric wing and sending people running into the street midway through their dental work on sunday , the explosions and flying shrapnel blew out windows in the maternity ward tragedy was averted only because the deputy head doctor , marina ovsyanik , had evacuated 52 new and expecting mothers into the basement the night before , even though one woman was already in labor she gave birth to a healthy boy in the basement , dr ovsyanik said as larisa faleyeva cradled her 4dayold daughter at the hospital , she said she thought these early traumatic days of conflict would bring the girl a special fate in life i hope and ask god to give her a peaceful life , she said
my sunday column , drawing on some recent provocations from philip jenkins and peter thiel , raised the counterintuitive possibility that the apparent post1970s decline of religious cults in the western world might actually be bad news a sign not only of diminished religious intensity and ferment , but also of waning creativity and curiosity overall now reason s peter suderman has a very interesting response , in which he suggests that the cultic impulse which my column described as bound up with the belief that there are major secrets left to be uncovered , insights that existing institutions have failed to unlock better ways of living that a small group might successfully embrace has simply been channeled into healthier , safer , more purely consensual forms of intense living , and in particular into the distinctive subcultures that the internet age , especially , has allowed to flourish some of these subcultures remain distinctly fringe \( dumpsterdiving freegans , gently quirky bronies , furry fans , juggalos \) , while others are embraced , to varying degrees , by the mainstream at its height , occupy wall street was as much an alternative lifestyle and belief community as a political movement what is crossfit if not a ritualized system that offers its highly dedicated , tightlyknit cells of followers a better and more meaningful existence \? none of these are cults in the specific sense that douthat describes , with gated compounds and secret songs , but they are all experiments in behavior , taste , and belief intended to help adherents find meaning and connection in their lives worries about the decline of cults are in some sense a form of nostalgia for an older order , with more clearly delineated lines between the mainstream and the fringe , with radicalism easy to recognize and define and , if necessary , shun that those days are largely over \( at least in the us \) isn t a sign that our culture has lost its capacity for lifestyle creativity , its desire for secret knowledge and methods it s a sign that the creativity is happening elsewhere now , in the blur between the boundaries , in the scrambling of the systems , in the subculture collage i m only slightly exaggerating when i say that this raises the most important question facing western culture and society right now suderman is right , i think , that these individualized and customtailored forms of association are where creative questing artistic religious impulses are increasingly being channeled , thanks to the internet and various broader economic and social forces what s more uncertain , to my mind , is whether they really encourage the kind of intense , enveloping commitment that i tend to think that deep creativity \( among other goods \) requires to the extent that likeminded people finding one another in ways that weren t previously possible are creating cultural experiments that are as immersive , if not more so , than anything in the human past , then suderman s case for optimism makes a lot of sense but to the extent that these experiments are more , well , dilettantish than past cultural groupings , more like hobbies than real commitments , more of a temporary identity that can be shaken off the moment it no longer completely pleases , they seem more likely to skim the shallows of creativity \( to borrow an image from one of online culture s more persuasive critics \) than plumbing the true depths , more likely to cycle through pastiches and remixes \( often fun and entertaining ones ! \) without stirring up something fullyrealized and new this is a particularly important question where religion is concerned , because there i think an intensity and exclusivity of commitment even allowing for the terrible dark side of such commitments , manifested in cases like jonestown or the reign of marcel maciel is particularly essential , particularly crucial to discovering , encouraging and sustaining the goods , both temporal and eternal , that religious faith seeks to provide not that spiritual bricolage can t be a pathway of discovery and a conduit of grace but in the end the atoms have to reknit , the search has to lead to either conversion or a new synthesis , for the mixing and matching suderman describes to be more than just a postmodern parasitism on the integrity of existing ideas and theologies and faiths and where those ideas are mostly absent , where the commitment is strictly to the self or strictly to experimentation as an end unto itself , well crossfit and burning man are cultish and revivalish , respectively , just as suderman suggests , but because the ish controls , what they actually deliver communally , aesthetically , intellectually , you name it is just a pale and nearparodic imitation of the riches of a fullyrealized religion i ve belabored versions of this point in opeds and book reviews and my most recent book , so i ll belabor it no further it s possible , of course , that the religious realm is a distinctive case , that it can be hived off , bracketed from other forms of creativity , other kinds of questing and innovation and experimentation \( you know i don t think so , but others might \) or alternatively , it s possible that while today s cultural associations and movements and communities lack something in intensity and comprehensiveness compared to groupings in the past , they make up for any deficit in the kind of selfselection involved you can t bind people as fully or invest them as completely as in the past , but you can get communities of common interest and common purpose going more easily , because there are no longer the same geographic boundaries keeping the likeminded apart so what s lost in fervor is gained in networking , perhaps this argument plainly has some truth to it certainly my own intellectual development \( such as it is \) benefited from precisely those kind of networked relationships of common interest , and a great of what i , like suderman , consider the best of today s pop art has profited from the same networking happening with audiences with niche constituencies making idiosyncratic or genrebased projects more commercially viable than they would have been in a less subcultural world but there are also limits to a networked creativity that proceeds exclusively along individualized and customtailored lines consider the case of occupy wall street , which suderman nods to , plausibly , as a kind of cultic flowering in our very recent past ows succeeded , remarkably , as a kind of bottomup movement that offered something different to all of its varied participants it failed , ultimately , because it never found the kind of philosophical or ideological or organizational center necessary to become something more than a marxist tribute band , a burning man of protest politics there was ferment , but there was no distillation , and if there was ever a movement that needed to be a little more cultish in the sense of rallying around a specific visionary with a specific tenpoint plan for world domination it was the folks who occupied zuccotti park \( they also probably needed to expand their ranks a little further beyond the upper middle class which points to another issue with the subcultural explosion , which is that a strictly individualized and customtailored approach to joining and belonging and colaboring might not be for almost everyone , as suderman suggests , and might instead be more classbound and less democratic than prior movements , earlier experiments , more demanding faiths \) if you re worried about the downside of channeling human creativity into more atomized and personalized enthusiasms , then , the occupy movement is an excellent case study it was strange , it was interesting , it was distinctive , it borrowed liberally from potent antecedents and opened itself to all manner of experiments , it let people step away from their ordinary lives , get caught up in a movement , meet likeminded people , feel an adrenaline rush and have some fun it embodied everything that suderman celebrates about our new culture of remix , collaboration , and collage and in the cold light of hindsight , in the realm of ideas and the realm of politics alike , it s clear that
the 10 million estate of s dreams is hidden behind a tall , creamcolored wall of texas limestone and a solid steel gate visitors pull into a circular driveway beneath a grand oak tree whose branches stretch toward a 7 , 806squarefoot spanish colonial mansion the tree itself speaks of armstrong s famous will it was once on the other side of the property , 50 yards west of this house armstrong wanted it at the front steps the transplantation cost 200 , 000 his close friends joke that armstrong , who is agnostic , engineered the project to prove he did n't need god to move heaven and earth for nearly a decade , lance armstrong and i have had a contentious relationship seven years have passed since his agent , bill stapleton , first threatened to sue me back then , i was just one of the many reporters armstrong had tried to manipulate , charm or bully i 've interviewed him oneonone in five countries on team buses that smelled of sweatsoaked lycra at the , in swanky new york city hotel rooms , in the backs of limousines , in soulless conference rooms and for hours by telephone now , in the spring of 2013 , after his whole world has come crashing down and moving trucks are en route to dismantle his beloved estate , i 've come to visit him at home in austin , tex , for the first time yes , fine , come on out , he said troubled by endless obituaries of his celebrated \( and now fraudulent \) career , he wanted to ensure that i wrote the true story  john thomas neal a man who would come to know armstrong better than anyone , better than even armstrong himself was an independently wealthy real estate investor and massage therapist , a husband and father , who worked as a soigneur in elite cycling soigneur is a french term meaning one who cares for others in cycling , that person gives the riders massages , prepares their lunches and water bottles , cleans their uniforms and transports their baggage a fixer , nurturer and wise counselor , neal had worked with professional athletes on the beach volleyball tour and with swimmers at the university of texas but his passion was cycling because he loved the sport and the travel though he had a law degree , legal work did n't satisfy him and he did n't stick with it anyway , he could afford to quit because he had married into money so in austin , he volunteered to work with the athletes at the university of texas in time , he had made enough connections and had cultivated a reputation in the olympic sports world for being so good at his job that he was hired as a soigneur for the subarumontgomery professional cycling team eddie borysewicz , a former united states olympic cycling coach , was in charge of the team , owned by thomas weisel , an investment banker who would eventually own the united states postal service cycling team when he first signed on , neal worked races only in the united states and had n't heard much about doping , except that performanceenhancing drug use among cyclists was prevalent in europe he met armstrong in 1989 at a texas triathlon , after borysewicz told him to look out for the budding cycling star armstrong s allout effort at the 1989 junior worlds in moscow had caught borysewicz s eye the coach convinced armstrong to switch to cycling from triathlon because cycling was an olympic sport armstrong , perhaps the hottest upandcoming cyclist in the world , later landed a spot with the subarumontgomery team by then , neal and armstrong knew each other well nearly a dozen athletes in austin both men and women still say they were closer to neal than to their fathers he brought them into his family and gave them stability armstrong was just the latest athlete in need neal also became close friends with armstrong s mother , linda armstrong was relocating to austin from plano because its hilly terrain was perfect for training at a steeply discounted rate , armstrong moved into an apartment complex owned by neal near downtown among tall trees , 20 paces from neal s office it was a comfortable , safe place that armstrong could call home later , armstrong told the dallas morning news his apartment was killer sooo nice ! he and neal met every day , sometimes several times a day , for massages and meals it gave neal satisfaction to know that he could have a positive impact on a teenager who needed some guidance neal s first impression was that the kid s ego exceeded his talent armstrong was brash and illmannered , in desperate need of refinement but the more he learned of armstrong s home life , the sorrier neal began to feel for him he was a boy without a reliable father linda armstrong wrote in her 2005 autobiography that she was pleased that her son had found a responsible male role model , and that neal had lent a sympathetic ear to her while she dealt with the rocky transition between marriages neal soon recognized that armstrong s insecurities and anger were products of his broken family he felt abandoned by his biological father and mistreated by his adoptive one armstrong did n't like to be alone , so neal often met him for breakfast at the upper crust cafe , just down the street from neal s house , and for lunch at a sports bar called the tavern armstrong ate dinner with the neals , including their three children , several times a week it was nothing fancy sometimes just slowcooked beans eaten with plastic utensils out of mismatched mugs , as if they were on a camping trip but they were a family frances , neal s wife , and armstrong were the group s jokers they might chase each other around the dinner table they might sing parts of ice ice baby by the dallas rapper vanilla ice , a song that then sat atop the music charts one would sing , ice ice baby ! and the other would reply , too cold , too cold ! on some days , they would bring their show to the neals' motorboat , where they would spend the day swimming or waterskiing it was arguably the happiest , most uncomplicated time in armstrong s life he no longer had to worry about his adoptive father , terry armstrong , whom he considered overbearing , and his mother s current marital woes were 215 miles north on interstate 35 in plano his world centered on austin and neal , who gladly opened his home or apartments to national team cyclists like armstrong s future postal service teammates george hincapie , frankie andreu , chann mcrae and kevin livingston who wanted to train with armstrong in the texas hill country the day after armstrong moved into his new apartment , the neals saw him ride in lago vista , 35 miles from austin armstrong did poorly and admitted to neal that he 'd been up late the night before , drinking at an austin strip club named the yellow rose neal passed it off as his being just another rambunctious teenager testing his newfound freedom  in 1996 , neal was found to have multiple myeloma , a rare cancer of the plasma cells that inhibits the production of healthy blood cells several months later , armstrong discovered that he had testicular cancer the two of them grew even closer while enduring chemotherapy together in the last two years of neal s life , from spring 2000 to fall 2002 , in hopes of writing a book , he recorded 26 hours of audiotape the tapes recreate and comment on the most exciting times of his life , primarily the years when the young lance edward armstrong rose from obscurity to superstardom neal , who died of cancer just after armstrong had survived his bout with the disease , never finished the book long after his death , the tapes remained hidden in the bedroom closet of his son , scott nobody in the family had listened to them , but i was given the tapes , along with permission to use neal s words in this book while in austin to transcribe the recordings , i met with armstrong and asked him about his former best friend j t neal \? forget about that do n't go chasing that , he told me he dismissed neal s importance , saying neal had n't known anything about his doping because his drug use had started after they had grown apart but in just a few hours , i was sitting in the neal household , headphones on , listening to the first tape that neal had recorded it brought neal s voice to life today is the 12th of april , and this is the beginning of my recollections on lance armstrong  one call from armstrong to neal came before dawn in august 1991 could neal pick him up in san marcos \? armstrong was n't stranded on the side of the road in the texas outback he had not blown out a tire on his bike in a marathon training ride he was in jail the night before , 30 miles from austin , armstrong had partied with some women from southwest texas state university as they frolicked in an outdoor jacuzzi at one women s apartment complex , they made so much noise that the police came but that was only armstrong s first meeting with officers that night the second was the big one pulled over for driving erratically , he thought he could talk his way out of trouble so what if he had appeared drunk and refused to take a breathalyzer test \? he was sure the officer would be impressed when he told them who he was the best young cyclist in the country had he been a quarterback , maybe the ploy would have worked but a texas police officer could not care less about a guy s boasting about his prowess on a bike no , it was off to the county lockup neal , always concerned about armstrong s drinking and driving , picked him up from the san marcos jail the next day months later , upon receiving a notice that his driver s license could be suspended , armstrong forwarded it to neal on the envelope , he wrote j t this came today \? \? have a great xmas ! lance now acting as his lawyer as well as his friend , neal helped armstrong beat the charges and keep his license in turn , neal received from armstrong something rare and precious armstrong s trust armstrong sent him postcards from training trips and races such as a note dated aug 16 , 1991 , from weinund ferienort bischoffingen , germany j t hows it going \? well , germany is very nice as you probably know the worlds are a little over a week away and im nervous as hell at least i'm riding good now ! wish you were here ! the boys say hello' lance neal loved that the national team riders and american pro cyclists knew who he was some even called him for advice in hincapie s case i was stopped by customs with a suitcase filled with epo and other drugs , what should i do \? some of them , like armstrong and hincapie , were open with him about their drug use whether neal was complicit in any of their doping is unclear he said , though , that soigneurs in the united states had a different job from those in europe , where an intimate knowledge of pharmaceuticals had long been required neal learned that from soigneurs who had worked overseas according to neal , armstrong relied on shots and intravenous drips for recovery and prerace boosts of energy on the eve of the road race at the 1992 olympics , fellow cyclist timm peddie walked into armstrong s hotel room and saw neal and a gaggle of usa cycling officials standing around armstrong as he lay on a bed , hooked to an iv peddie was astonished at the openness of the procedure everyone there stared at the unexpected guest until peddie left as quickly as he had come in he was n't sure what he had seen maybe a blood transfusion \? an infusion of electrolytes or proteins \? he only knew that he had never received an iv before a race armstrong was , evidently , special at christmas 1993 , the year armstrong won a world championship and a milliondollar bonus , armstrong thanked neal with several gifts one was an autographed jersey in black marker , he signed it j t i'm very fortunate that our paths have crossed you 're truly my righthand man ! not to mention my best friend ! lance armstrong he gave neal a rolex watch inscribed to j t from lance armstrong neal accepted the watch as a symbol of armstrong s gratitude , even his love for a number of years , neal wore it with pride until the day came that he decided to never put it on his wrist again  throughout the 1990s , neal was armstrong s main soigneur at some domestic races and at national team training camps but in europe and at the big races , the honor of rubbing down armstrong went to john hendershot among soigneurs in the european peloton \( another french word , one that refers to professional riders generally as well as the pack during a race \) , hendershot was at once the cool kid and the calculating elder other soigneurs envied the money he made and the cachet that came with the cash wherever he walked through race crowds or at home in belgium people turned to catch a glimpse teams wanted him armstrong wanted him neal said he was like a god to me and called him the best soigneur that ever was hendershot , an american who lived in belgium to be closer to the main cycling circuit , was a massage therapist , physical therapist and miracle worker his layingon of hands would bring an exhausted , aching rider to life eating at hendershot s direction , sleeping according to his advice , a rider began each morning reborn he came with all the secrets of a soigneur and an unexpected skill developed over the years in neal s words , hendershot took to cycling s drug culture like a duck to water but his enthusiasm for and skills in chemistry would be remembered as his special talent before speaking to me last year , hendershot who had retired from the sport in 1996 , shortly after armstrong s cancer diagnosis had never told his story to a reporter after all the years of silence , he seemed relieved to finally share it for most of a decade , in the 1980s and '90s , hendershot sat in his makeshift laboratory , preparing for races there he mixed , matched and mashed up drugs , always with one goal in mind to make riders go faster the mad scientist conjured up what he called weird concoctions of substances like ephedrine , nicotine , highly concentrated caffeine , drugs that widen blood vessels , blood thinners and testosterone , often trying to find creative ways to give a rider an extra physical boost during a race he 'd pour the mix into tiny bottles and hand them to riders at the starting line other times , he 'd inject them with it he was n't alone in this endeavor soigneurs all across europe made homemade blends of potentially dangerous mixes and first drank or injected those potions into themselves they were their own lab rats hendershot , who had no formal medical or scientific training , knew a concoction was way off when he felt his heart beating so fast and so loud , it sounded like a runaway freight train that would n't work for riders under extreme physical stress he wanted amped up , but not to the point of a heart attack it was n't long before hendershot tried his potions and pills on the riders , including armstrong when armstrong turned professional after the 1992 olympics , he signed a contract with motorola , one of the two major american teams because armstrong wanted the best soigneur , he was immediately paired with hendershot it was a match made in doping heaven both soigneur and rider were willing to go to the brink of danger what we did was tread the fine line of dropping dead on your bike and winning , hendershot said hendershot said the riders on his teams had a choice about using drugs they could grab the ring or not he said he did n't know a single professional cyclist who had n't at least dabbled in doping the sport was simply too difficult and many times impossible , as was the threeweek tour de france for riders who did n't rely on pharmaceutical help when armstrong arrived at motorola in 1992 , a system that facilitated riders' drug use was firmly in place on the team and most likely in the entire sport hendershot said he would take a list of drugs and bogus prescriptions for them to his local pharmacist in hulste , belgium , to get them filled and to obtain other drugs , too cycling has been one of belgium s most popular sports for generations , and the pharmacist did n't question hendershot s request for such large quantities of drugs in exchange , hendershot would give the pharmacist a signed team jersey or allaccess passes to big races then he would leave with bags filled with the blood booster epo , human growth hormone , blood thinners , amphetamines , cortisone , painkillers and testosterone , a particularly popular drug he 'd hand to riders like candy by 1993 , armstrong was using all of those substances , as did many riders on the team , hendershot said he remembered armstrong s attitude as being , this is the stuff i take , this is part of what i do , and armstrong joined the team s program without hesitation because everyone else seemed to be doing it it was like eating team dinner , hendershot said , adding that he had a hunch that virtually every person knew doctors , soigneurs , riders , team managers , mechanics he called the drug use casual and said he never had to hide any of it after injecting the riders at a team hotel , he 'd toss a trash bag filled with syringes and empty vials into the garbage can although hendershot said he never administered epo or growth hormone to armstrong , he did give them to other riders on the team and said he was aware that armstrong was using those drugs hendershot said his wife had driven a stash of those two drugs from belgium to one of the team s 1995 training camps in southern france riders like armstrong could get drugs several ways , hendershot said from him , from their personal doctors or a doctor who worked with the team , or by buying them over the counter each rider would take his drugs to hendershot , who would administer them by mixing a potion for the rider to drink or inject , or by injecting them into ivs the rider would receive , based on the doctor s instructions sometimes , the drugs came in pill form , and hendershot doled those out , too hendershot was always worried that he was administering something that would hurt the cyclists or even possibly kill them especially when they injected the substances into their ivs or when their personal doctors would prepare concoctions for hendershot to give he was concerned that he would be culpable if anything ever went wrong even as he provided drugs to riders , hendershot said , he told himself you 're not a drug dealer this is n't organized this is no big deal he knew he was lying hendershot rationalized the lie by saying the doping process was overseen by max testa , an italian doctor who is still working in the sport and running a sports medicine clinic in utah in 2006 , testa told me that he gave his riders the instructions to use epo but never administered drugs to those riders in 2014 , he said he did n't want to discuss anything about the cyclists he had worked with , to protect the privacy of his patients still , if drug use was not mandated by the team , it appeared to be at least quasiofficial hendershot trusted testa to make sure the riders were staying safe , believing that testa unlike other doctors in cycling actually cared for the riders' health , and cared less about winning or money hendershot , however , put it this way a doctor who refused to give riders drugs would n't last in the sport armstrong liked testa so much that he moved to italy to be near the doctor s office in como , north of milan not long after joining motorola , armstrong began living in como during the racing season he brought along his close friend frankie andreu , and in time several other riders joined them , including george hincapie , a new yorker , and kevin livingston , a midwesterner all became patients of testa all later became riders on armstrong s tour de francewinning united states postal service teams hendershot said all those riders probably believed they were doing no wrong by doping the definition of cheating was flexible in a sport replete with pharmacology it s not cheating if everybody is doing it armstrong believed that to be the deadsolid truth for him , there was no hesitation , no secondguessing , no rationalizing as hendershot had done , armstrong grabbed the ring  it s june 2013 , and armstrong does n't want to move , he has to his sponsors have abandoned him , taking away an estimated 75 million in future earnings he would owe more than 135 million if he lost every lawsuit in which he is a defendant to slow the burn rate , as he calls it , he has stopped renting a penthouse near central park in manhattan and a house in marfa , tex next to go is this austin estate , traded for a much more modest abode near downtown his former sponsors including oakley , trek bicycle corporation , radioshack and nike have left him scrambling for money he considers them traitors he says trek s revenue was 100 million when he signed with the company and reached 1 billion in 2013 who s responsible for that \? he asks , before cursing and saying , right here he pokes himself in the chest with his right index finger i'm sorry , but that is true without me , none of that happens after his sponsors cast him aside , he tossed their gear there s a chance you could catch a glimpse of one of his dallas friends wearing armstrong s custommade yellow nike sneakers , with lance embroidered in small yellow block letters on the black tongues a goodwill outlet in austin is supplied with his nike clothes and oakley sunglasses the movers will have to contend with whatever brandname gear is left in his garage black livestrong nike caps , black nike duffel bags with bright yellow swooshes , oakley lenses and frames and a box of caps suggesting yes on prop 15 , a 2007 texas bond plan for cancer research , prevention and education supported by armstrong armstrong loves this house he loves its open spaces and floortoceiling windows he loves the lush landscaped yard where his children play soccer , and the crystalline pool \( a negativeedge pool , not an infinity pool , get it right , he said \) behind the house are rows of towering italian cypresses he moved here in 2006 after winning a record seventh tour de france he once said the place was his safe house inside it , nobody s going to mess with me having eluded continual attempts to expose his doping , he could take a left down the main hallway , then a quick right , and disappear into his walkin wine closet to grab a bottle of tignanello and toast his good luck seven years ago , he told his three children from his failed marriage luke , grace and isabelle that they would graduate from high school while living in the house by the big oak tree he owed them that they had followed him from texas to france to spain countless times at last they could plant some roots i promise , he said dad s not moving again but now the movers are coming it s june 6 , 2013 , five years before luke s expected graduation the next morning , a line of black trucks will pull into his driveway and out will spill workers in black shortsleeve shirts the atmosphere is funereal a week earlier , the movers emptied the 1 , 633squarefoot guesthouse , a minimansion , with its matching tan facade and burnt orange roof i return the next day to see those workers clear the main house they take armstrong s tour trophies from their illuminated shelves , cover them with green bubble wrap and place them in blue boxes in a box marked 64 , one mover places a silver frame containing a 5x7 photograph of armstrong s 2005 discovery channel team sitting at a dinner table after his seventh and final tour victory he , his teammates and his longtime team manager johan bruyneel are holding up seven fingers a yellow rubber livestrong bracelet hangs from each man s wrist a table is littered with halfempty wineglasses a former life box 64 goes onto the truck with the rest i follow the movers into the media room wearing white cotton gloves , they take down the seven yellow tour leader s jerseys framed above the couch in the dark before dawn , armstrong left the big house for good at 4 15 am on june 7 , 2013 , with his girlfriend , anna hansen , and his five children , he drove to austinbergstrom international airport for a commercial flight to hawaii , where they would remain for the first part of the summer armstrong tells me he did n't look back at the house he had built he says sentiment has never been his thing the move means only that part of his life has ended and another will begin that s all it is , he says several days later , only two of his possessions remained on his estate one could n't fit in the moving truck a 1970 black pontiac gto convertible given him by the singer sheryl crow , with whom he had a very public romance that ended when he pedaled away just before she got cancer the car , with its evocations of another armstrong failure , carries a price tag of 70 , 000 and , finally , left over in the living room of the guesthouse was a fully assembled drum kit just another piece of the man s discarded life oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly , i thought while i looked at the set , lyrics from streets of laredo , a song i know from my time working in texas
on thursday , five republicans in the senate finally decided the time for callousness had run out the senators , mostly from highunemployment states like illinois , nevada , pennsylvania and ohio , agreed to join with democrats in providing 60 votes to end a filibuster and extend the benefits for five months , backdated to december the deal , which will come to a vote in the senate later this month , is far too short in duration , but still represents an important breakthrough in a chamber where important legislation is routinely filibustered negotiators were able to fend off the worst of the republican addons , such as eliminating tax credits for the children of undocumented immigrants , or denying jobless benefits to those also receiving disability payments extending customs fees and changing the way corporations calculate their pension payments will pay for the 97 billion cost there will also be an end to benefits for those with income of more than 1 million \( mostly from investments and other household income \) , and an attempt to match up longterm unemployed people with training or counseling that could get them back to work none of those ideas are particularly objectionable , though it would have been a better stimulus for the economy if the benefits weren t paid for at all previous congresses approved these extensions without the tedious search for offsets , before the word stimulus was allowed to become poisonous but the deal still isn t good enough for many house republicans , who will get the bill if the senate passes it on friday , the conservative stalwarts who have long believed more suffering will push lazy people back to work dismissed the idea of more government assistance no , said jim jordan , republican of ohio , speaking with time magazine we need to be focused on policies that create jobs , not focusing on extending unemployment insurance forever when speaker john boehner was asked whether he supported the senate deal and would bring it to the floor , he responded you mean the one that can t be implemented \? as long these house members many from the same states where unemployment is so high continue getting reelected , the jobless will continue to wait , and wait some more
parrotfish eat algae and seaweed these brightly colored fish with beaklike mouths inhabit coral reefs , the wellsprings of ocean life without them and other herbivores , algae and seaweed would overgrow the reefs , suppress coral growth and threaten the incredible array of life that depends on these reefs for shelter and food this was happening in bermuda , until the government in 1990 banned fish traps that were decimating the parrotfish population today , bermuda s coral reefs are relatively healthy , a bright spot in the wider caribbean , where total coral cover has declined by half since 1970 last month , in a reminder of just how dire the situation facing the world s coral reefs is , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said it was listing under the endangered species act , including all of what were once the most abundant caribbean corals the action focused primarily on the projected impacts of global warming and ocean acidification carbon dioxide emissions are increasing ocean temperatures and making them more acidic and less hospitable for corals but climate change is only half the story up to now , the impacts of climate change on reefs have been much less destructive than the localized effects of overfishing , runoff pollution from the land and the destruction of habitats from coastal development those problems have exploded in intensity over the past century and will continue to increase sharply with population growth proof of the destructive power of those impacts is evident in the central pacific where , in spite of rising temperatures , coral cover is many times higher around islands unaffected by fishing and pollution , compared with heavily fished and polluted reefs of nearby islands a of the changing status of caribbean reefs over the past 40 years by the global coral reef monitoring network and the international union for conservation of nature provides a similarly important finding that offers hope across the caribbean , reefs near islands with effective local protections and governance , like the ones around bermuda , have double the amount of living coral compared with those that lack those protections they also have more fish and clearer waters but in florida , banning fish traps which should result in more parrotfish , less algae and more coral has not stemmed coral decline that s because of extreme local pressures from millions of residents and tourists and insufficient controls on development similar problems plague the great barrier reef in australia , which is being damaged by agricultural runoff and the development of huge ports for exporting coal fishing is carefully regulated there , but those other threats must be equally well managed the few remaining places in the wider caribbean with relatively healthy reefs have one thing in common a greater abundance of parrotfish and other herbivores they also benefit by being adjacent to islands with comparatively small populations , more modest development and less pollution you find this in the flower garden banks national marine sanctuary in the northern gulf of mexico , on reefs around cura ao and bonaire and in protected marine areas in the bahamas and the cayman islands stories about coral reefs commonly focus on doom and gloom but these new findings indicate that there is actually something we can do right now to help reefs recover prevent overfishing , overdevelopment and pollution from the land none of this lessens our concerns about climate change as humanity burns more coal and oil instead of less but there is increasing evidence that protection from local stresses promotes the resilience of reef corals to climate change several caribbean islands are moving to control overfishing and pollution barbuda just enacted legislation to protect parrotfish , stop overfishing and establish marine sanctuaries and the bahamas , belize , bonaire , cuba and cura ao are working to enhance protections in contrast , the condition of the coral reefs of the florida keys , the united states virgin islands and puerto rico is among the worst in the wider caribbean , despite vast sums invested in the monitoring of reefs and research on the effects of climate change this monitoring and research are vitally important , but collecting information without strong corrective action is like a doctor analyzing a patient s decline without doing everything possible to save her life we need to move immediately beyond listings of species as threatened and research about climate change and take rigorous action against the local and global stresses killing corals coral reefs are vital to the economies of the 38 caribbean countries and territories and their millions of people these reefs generate roughly 3 billion annually in tourism and fishing and provide protection from storms to save coral reefs , we need to follow the lead of barbuda and our other proactive neighbors we need to stop all forms of overfishing , establish large and effectively enforced marine protected areas and impose strict regulations on coastal development and pollution while at the same time working to reduce fossil fuel emissions driving climate change it s not either or it s all of the above
london first there was an anonymous letter outlining an islamic takeover of british schools in muslim neighborhoods ominously called operation trojan horse then the letter was found to be riddled with inaccuracies and widely deemed to be a hoax now a report by a former antiterrorism chief suggests that some of the concerns raised by the letter fake or not may in fact be real , the latest twist in a tortured debate about how to reconcile islam and britishness in a country that has one of western europe s largest muslim communities according to the report by peter clarke , the former head of scotland yard s counterterrorism command , there was coordinated , deliberate and sustained action to introduce an intolerant and aggressive islamic ethos into a few schools in birmingham mr clarke said there was no evidence of actual radicalization , violence or encouragement of terrorism but he told the bbc that there s clearly been a wish to introduce what has been described as a conservative religious agenda into those schools islamic hardliners had gained influence on school boards , he said , installing sympathetic head teachers or senior members of staff , appointing likeminded people to key positions , and seeking to remove head teachers who they do not feel to be sufficiently compliant with their agenda among the concerns highlighted in the report were calls to friday prayer broadcast over loudspeakers that were apparently stopped during a school inspection and complaints that female members of staff were not treated equally britain s new education secretary , nicky morgan , reporting the results of the investigation to parliament on tuesday , called the findings disturbing she said some teachers were likely to face disciplinary action and some might even be barred from the profession in birmingham , a city in the english heartland where more than one in five inhabitants are muslim , some current and former staff members at some of the handful of schools in question do not dispute that the teaching staff and leadership in majoritymuslim neighborhoods had become more diversified but they said that what had been characterized as meddling by extremists was mostly muslims advocating to improve their children s educational performance one public high school at the heart of the trojan horse controversy , , was ranked as one of the worst schools in birmingham in the 1990s , with most students failing their final exams but by 2012 it had received top marks from school inspectors , and nearly four in every five of its students now go on to university last week , members of the trust running park view resigned collectively in protest at what they called a coordinated and vicious offensive the chairman of the trust , tahir alam , said he and his colleagues were proud of the work they had done to turn around schools like park view at a time when no one much cared about the young people of east birmingham , when their schools were failing them for decades reacting to tuesday s report , mr alam said meeting the religious needs of students had been an important part of tackling issues of low expectations and systemic failure and there had indeed been very stiff resistance from many heads in birmingham schools he accused the previous education secretary , michael gove , who had commissioned the report but was removed from his post in a last week , of being the driving force behind months of scrutiny that he said had brought the school s reputation to the point of destruction early in the process , mr gove had angered muslims when he vowed to drain the swamp of extremism one teacher in birmingham , a nonmuslim who declined to be identified for fear of losing his job , said tuesday , clarke wrote the report that gove wanted him to write some opposition lawmakers urged ms morgan to win back the trust of parents we need ministers who drop the divisive rhetoric which mr gove has used in the past , liam byrne , a labour lawmaker , told the bbc at times in east birmingham we have felt like we are just a football in michael gove s culture wars tensions have been notably on the rise since the killing last year of a white soldier on a london street by two britishborn muslims , and there has been growing concern about a steady stream of britons heading to fight as jihadists in syria hate crimes against muslims have been rising , too but ms morgan suggested that fear of being accused of racism and antiislamic views had allowed a small number of people with a shared ideology to take over schools these people had a restricted and narrow interpretation of their faith , and had failed to promote fundamental british values and to challenge the extremist views of others , she said particularly shocking , she said , was evidence of a social media group , called the park view brotherhood , used by some staff members of park view according to mr clarke s report , the group s online chats included explicit homophobia offensive comments about british soldiers a stated ambition to increase gender segregation in the school and a constant undercurrent of antiwestern , antiamerican and antiisraeli sentiment untangling religiousness from extremism has proved especially tricky in a country that has never drawn a clear line between state and religion the queen is both head of state and head of the anglican church public schools , while nondenominational , do not just tolerate the opportunity for collective worship , but require it that worship is to be wholly or mainly christian in character , official guidelines say but in schools where the overwhelming majority of students are muslims , head teachers can request special dispensation to hold islamic assemblies instead some educational experts say the only longterm solution to the question of how much religion is too much is to end all worship in state schools the requirement has led the community quite naturally to think that religion , apart from the agreed syllabus , had legitimate wider influence on the curriculum it does not , tim brighouse , a former chief education officer of birmingham and schools commissioner for london ,  legislation is now needed to replace the act of worship clause with the need to promote pluralism and respect for those with different faiths and none , while making sure that schools stand for those values that underpin a peaceful and civilized society
the yankees could not recover from cc sabathia s ugly start and lost the season opener , 62 , to the houston astros continue reading for highlights and analysis the yankees could not recover from sabathia s ugly start and lost the season opener , 62 was there any good news tonight \? well , there are 161 more games to play , so that s good no yankees got hurt , including jeter , who was hit in the left forearm by a pitch in the first inning sabathia did settle down after yielding six runs in the first two innings , striking out five in the four scoreless innings that followed the bullpen was very sharp , with betances and vidal nuno striking out a combined five of six batters the only runs came in the eighth inning , two of them on singles by mccann and teixeira the yankees will try again on wednesday night with hiroki kuroda making the start against jarred cosart ellsbury led off the inning with a walk and jeter followed with his first hit of the season , a single to right field ellsbury eventually scored on a mccann single , and teixeira nudged the ball through the left side of the shift to bring home jeter but before hopes got too high , soriano grounded into an inningending double play yankees fans will remember dellin betances as one of the killer b s , the trio of yankees pitching prospects \( along with manuel banuelos and andrew brackman \) that were highly thought of just a few years ago brackman is no longer with the yankees and banuelos is recovering from tommy john surgery , but betances is still very much relevant betances , once thought of as a possible future anchor of the rotation , reinvented himself as a relief pitcher this past spring and earned a spot in the bullpen betances just showed us why , striking out two in a perfect seventh inning , mixing his fourseam fastball \( in the high90s \) with a nasty knuckle curve the yankees bullpen has question marks , so there s room for betances to play a major role johnson was retired easily on a dribbler back to the mound sabathia s night also appears to be over he managed to settle down after two scary innings , which gives girardi something positive to say during the postgame press conference the yankees have their first major threat of the game the bases are loaded with two outs , and kelly johnson is stepping up feldman is finished after a stellar first start , but a walk , hit batsman and a single to teixeira led to his exit teixeira , who has reached base twice now \( walk and single \) , is one of the many question marks in the yankees infield as the former allstar is attempting to come back from wrist surgery everyone can go out after major surgery and say they feel fine , teixeira said earlier this spring but you never really know it until you go out there last season , the yankees sorely missed the player who averaged 34 home runs and 106 runs batted in over his first four seasons with the club and whose defense is second to none at first base teixeira s numbers this spring were anything but impressive , with only three hits in 35 atbats but more importantly , he did not suffer any setbacks regarding his health yankee fans will also be quick to remind skeptics the teixeira is a notoriously slow starter i ve been a bit surprised to hear the reaction that beltran has gotten by the houston fans he played for the astros for just a few months in 2004 , but almost carried them to the world series that fall , batting 435 with 8 home runs 14 runs batted in during the playoffs but he chose to sign with the mets that following season , and the astros fans are still angry about that , apparently beltran still has the only yankees hit here in the seventh inning , astros still lead 60 for any yankees fans looking for good news on this bleak opening night , jeter has looked like his old self playing the field there have not been any highlight reel moments , but on the balls hit to him tonight , he is having no issues with his footing and making strong throws exciting , i know but it is encouraging the first yankees hit of the 2014 season came off of the bat of carlos beltran , who signed a threeyear , 45 million contract with the yankees this offseason for beltran , who will turn 37 on april 24 , this is his second tour with a new york club , so he knows what to expect playing in a big market i learned that you have to be strong mentally , he said this spring don t worry about what people say about you , what you hear on tv , read in the newspaper i came from a smallmarket team , the kansas city royals , so that first year in new york was hard for me i was too nice i tried to accommodate everybody i forgot about the reason i was brought to new york to play baseball instead , i tried to please people his hit did not lead to a run the yankees had two on with two out , after a teixeira walk , but feldman got soriano out swinging they still trail , 60 , heading into the bottom of the fourth it was not supposed to start like this for sabathia the astros tacked on two more runs in the second inning , one on a solo homer by lj hoes and another on a single by altuve while it s true sabathia had the worst season of his career in 2013 , including his highest earned run average \( 478 \) and his lowest winning percentage \( 519 \) , he did finish the season strong , or at least better , with a 390 era in september he also didn t allow a home run over his last four starts the improvement came after sabathia rediscovered some old things and figured out some new things , like how to get by with a fastball in the lower 90s rather than midtohigh 90s that success carried over to the spring for sabathia i feel unbelievable , he said recently all the work in the offseason this spring has really paid off my arm feels great , my knees feel fantastic i have no complaints i feel really strong and ready to start the season maybe that will translate to success this season , eventually the differences between the yankees and astros are stark and obvious most glaring is in team payroll , with houston having the lowest in the majors \( 45 million \) and the yankees the secondhighest \( 204 million \) after finishing with the worst record in baseball \( 51111 \) , the astros made a few changes , trading for the outfielder dexter fowler and signing starting pitcher scott feldman feldman , tonight s starting pitcher , is earning more than a quarter of the team s total payroll for 2014 \( 12 million \) after going 1212 with a 386 era with the chicago cubs and baltimore orioles but the thing to know about the astros is that they are loaded with young talent , with their best players waiting in the wings their top prospects include shortstop carlos correa , first baseman jon singleton , starters mark appel and mike foltynewicz , and outfielders delino deshields jr and george springer nobody knows when this team s going to turn the page and start winning a lot of ballgames , but everything is headed in that direction right now , feldman said this spring we ve got the no 1rated farm system you know when that wave of talent reaches this level , they re going to be here for a while the future looks bright , and so does the present they lead the yankees , 40 , heading into the bottom half of the second has andy pettitte come out of retirement yet \?  harvey araton \( harveyaraton \) 1 apr 14 sabathia has had a very rough first inning , allowing a long leadoff double to dexter fowler , who came around to score on a single by jose altuve but it got much worse from there altuve stole second and ended up at third on a wild throw by mccann and eventually scored on a fielder s choice then , jesus guzman launched one over the leftcenter field wall lets recap jeter hit by pitch in his first atbat , cc gives up long 2b in stros first ab , yankees have 1 error and 2 more def miscues  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 1 apr 14 jeter got a nice hand from the houston crowd before the first atbat of his last season the mood quickly shifted after jeter was hit on his left forearm with the second pitch he did not appear to be seriously injured as he stayed in the game but he was stranded on base as the three bigname additions , ellsbury , beltran and mccann , all made outs jeter s spring numbers were weak \( 137 average \) but , more importantly , his body held up i d rather get out three times and have three good atbats as opposed to getting three hits jeter said about his spring stats in the regular season , it s the complete opposite overall , jeter was happy with his spring , saying his timing at the plate was steadily improving with all the new additions this offseason , one can t help but think of the winter of 2009 , when the yankees added several highpriced free agents like sabathia and mark teixeira the result a world series championship i think it has a lot of the same feel , joe girardi said this spring i think there s a high expectation with the names that we ve added we addressed a lot of situations because of all of the things we went through last year , and there s a lot of the same feelings we re a long way from october but we re just moments away from the first pitch the great nolan ryan threw out the first pitch so wide that craig biggio couldn t catch it inauspicious  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 1 apr 14 tonight is our first chance to see the new and improved yankees lineup in action the difference from last year s opening day squad is drastic , with brett gardner the only starting offensive

jacoby ellsbury cf derek jeter ss carlos beltran rf brian mccann c mark teixeira 1b alfonso soriano dh brett gardner lf brian roberts 2b kelly johnson 3b by the end of the season , the yankees lineup didn t look any closer to what it looks like tonight in fact , the starting lineup for the last game of the season , against these same astros , has zero similarities with tonight s starting nine sure , the final game for a team out of the playoff hunt will often feature lateseason callups , but curtis granderson , cano , wells , mark reynolds , nunez and to some extent , travis hafner , were all regulars on last season s squad i heard derek jeter had lunch with george hw bush today the 1st president bush , who may make an appearance here at minute maid park  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 1 apr 14 much has changed for the yankees since c c sabathia last pitched in a regularseason game one just has to look at the starting lineup from that sept 20 game against the san francisco giants only one player from that lineup , alfonso soriano , is expected to be in tuesday night s batting order when the yankees open their 2014 season against the astros in houston yes , the lyle overbay era came to an end this winter with the infusion of the highly paid , proven talents of jacoby ellsbury , carlos beltran and brian mccann , along with the 155 million japanese import , pitcher masahiro tanaka the yankees are also banking on the healthy return of mark teixeira at first base and derek jeter at shortstop , and of pitcher michael pineda , an allstar in 2011 with seattle at age 22 whose impressive spring earned him the fifth spot in the starting rotation but one thing that has stayed true since september is that sabathia is the ace of the pitching staff , and he will need to look the part more than he did last season if the yankees want to make the playoffs after the worst season of his career , 1413 with a 478 earned run average , sabathia made changes this spring no longer able to rely on an overpowering fastball , he worked on adding a cut fastball and mixed in more changeups , and the results were promising he finished the exhibition season 31 with a 129 era sabathia is also stronger physically than he was entering 2013 , when he was recovering from elbow surgery last year , i kind of had some doubts going into the year , not feeling strong , weak , my elbow , just questions , sabathia told david waldstein and this year feels great i feel like i don t have anything to worry about
chris brown begins x , his new album , in a buckpassing mood the opening song , the title track , begins , if you 're only as good as the company you keep then i'ma blame you for what they say about me for a man for whom accountability has n't been a strong suit , this pronouncement is both extremely troubling and completely obvious , a position statement of shrugging and deflecting the majority of mr brown s career has been defined by his 2009 assault of rihanna , then his girlfriend , for which he pleaded guilty and received five years' probation and community service with x \( rca \) , he has now released twice as many albums as a felon as he had before four to two and none have gone very far toward repairing his public image even now , more than five years after the attack , violence defines his narrative see , for example , the headline that recently appeared on mtv s website an interview with mr brown chris brown s advice for ray rice it s how you control your anger in the wake of the ray rice domestic violence scandal , cbs decided to delay broadcasting an opening segment for its thursday night football programming featuring rihanna s run this town we needed to have the appropriate tone and coverage , sean mcmanus , the chairman of cbs sports , told sports illustrated that same night , mr brown performed on the tonight show , typical of a culture that absolves the perpetrator but often continues to punish the victim \( after rihanna complained on twitter the audacity , she wrote cbs canceled the plan to go ahead with the segment altogether \) mr brown , who has a fervent fan base , has remained popular despite the pillory and while he has had a fair share of hits , his infamy has survived his musical accomplishments so it may not matter much that x is one of his least ambitious releases from a singer with less devoted fans , it might come and go with little notice but in the two years that it has taken to release x , mr brown has had a string of hits that have kept him in the conversation the sweet fine china , the raunchy love more , the tactless loyal \( the first two of those are burned off here as bonus tracks , a reminder of how long this album has been delayed , with announced release dates going all the way back to summer of last year \) those are the standout songs in what s primarily a sea of mediocrity mr brown is a lithe singer but not a particularly emphatic one on his best songs , he darts in and out vocally over uptempo production wellsuited to his fluid dance moves but in this album , these feverish impulses feel muted he sounds tentative , maybe a little fatigued that s the case on songs on 12 play , an unmemorable homage to r kelly , who appears on the exceedingly moist drown in it and effectively schools the younger singer , whose tone is airy and rarely convincingly seductive \( mr kelly remains intensely popular despite years of allegations of improper sexual activity pairing the two feels like tacky gimmickry \) in a couple of places , mr brown sings with real intensity , especially autumn leaves , a collaboration with kendrick lamar it s bruised , and almost feels as if mr lamar is scolding him from inside the song given mr brown s history , it stands to reason that fraught duets with women would make for some of his most provocative material , but he has rarely collaborated with female artists , and almost never on his own albums his most successful duet no air , with jordin sparks , appeared on her album , not his and his most controversial duet came when he added vocals to rihanna s birthday cake by and large , female performers have steered clear of mr brown s albums , until now brandy joins him on a passionate , do better , that details a rollicking , crumbling relationship it s soft as a heartbeat , and one of the best songs here the woozy drunk texting features jhen aiko , and the video for do n't be gone too long , a martial pop stomper , features the young pop star ariana grande most uncomfortable is do n't think they know , which includes old aaliyah vocals by appearing alongside him , these women implicitly vouch for his character , and maybe that s part of a longterm strategy toward rebuilding mr brown s image at minimum , it links him to women besides rihanna for years , mr brown largely avoided the press because the conversation always came back to rihanna but lately , he has reemerged , willing to give , at the least , facsimiles of answers to questions about that phase of his life asked recently by billboard if he can envision a time when his relationship with rihanna wo n't be mentioned , he when we 're not relevant anymore , that might be the case as long as you 're doing something good , people will always bring up old stuff or negative stuff because they do n't want you to surpass a certain level consciously or not , albums like x hasten the arrival of that future
washington the federal building in washington housing the education department is named after president the department of health and human services , a much bigger agency , is in a building named after his vice president , hubert h humphrey unlike most other contemporary presidents , johnson has no airport bearing his name , and you can count on your fingers the number of times he has been prominently mentioned at the last 11 democratic national conventions in a gallup poll , only 20 percent of americans rated johnson an aboveaverage president , a lower ranking than george w bush or jimmy carter yet the 36th president affected the lives of most americans and changed the fabric of today s society more than any president since franklin d roosevelt this is overlooked or brushed aside because of another legacy the disastrous war in vietnam a confluence of events may redress this imbalance this is the 50th anniversary of the johnsonengineered civil rights act of 1964 the civil rights summit at the lbj presidential library in austin , tex , last week included president obama and three former presidents then there is all the way , a broadway play starring the talented bryan cranston as johnson , and todd s purdum s compelling book on the passage of the civil rights act , an idea whose time has come , which captures johnson s political brilliance he left the presidency under the dark cloud of vietnam , and it has taken us this long to maybe finally see the forest for the trees , said mark updegrove , director of the johnson library at the university of texas the laws he put in place were transformative race always has been the great american paradox after abraham lincoln , no one did as much as johnson to address this blemish the 1964 act barring discrimination in public accommodations , the 1965 , the 1968 housing bill and the appointment of the first black supreme court justice , thurgood marshall the book and play capture the full johnson , cajoling , charming , manipulating , forcing through the 1964 act , which is among the most important pieces of legislation in american history he understood the egos , frailties and needs of lawmakers it is especially appropriate to spotlight these civil rights measures now , as state legislatures , and even the united states supreme court , are rolling back some of those protections likewise , the conventional wisdom is that johnson s great society and war on poverty failed the centerpiece was the 1965 enactment of and despite worries about future financing and occasional scams , medicare is central to the contemporary american experience last year , 52 million americans were on medicare and 57 million were on medicaid there were failures as johnson overreached but the poverty rate fell for the five years after johnson s initial programs were enacted and there were landmark successes the elementary and secondary education act , the higher education act , special education for children with disabilities , food stamps , medical research , the corporation for public broadcasting and the national endowments for the arts and the humanities johnson was a bully crude , insecure and paranoid he also was unrivaled as an indoor \( as opposed to outdoor , or campaignmode \) political strategist , and he could be compassionate and generous mr cranston gets all this at some moments on opening night , i thought i was seeing my old boss , said joseph a califano jr , johnson s top aide on the great society programs none of this absolves johnson of the debacle of vietnam , a war in which more than 58 , 200 americans lost their lives he was partly responsible for an enormous tragedy , said michael beschloss , a presidential historian but he also was hugely responsible for much of what we 're living today
washington the pentagon has proposed to that 10 , 000 american troops remain in when the international combat mission there ends after this year , or none at all , senior government officials said tuesday that figure , debated in recent days within the white house , is the midpoint of a range of 8 , 000 to 12 , 000 troops most of them americans that has been contemplated for months as the united states and its nato allies planned for the long mission s end anything less than that , the officials said , would be too few to be able to protect the reduced retinue of diplomats , military and intelligence officials that remain in afghanistan the proposal is 10 , 000 or basically nothing , a pullout , said one official , who has been briefed on the plan but spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal administration deliberations both the intelligence agencies and the state department , who would have personnel remaining in afghanistan after 2014 , back the defense department s proposal , the officials said but it has met resistance among some officials in the white house national security council , including vice president joseph r biden jr , who question why the choice has to be 10 , 000 troops or zero , and nothing in between about 37 , 500 american troops are currently in afghanistan , about twice as many as the number of international forces also there administration officials declined to confirm a report in the wall street journal that the military s plan would call for quickly withdrawing the troops so that none remained by the time mr obama leaves office in january 2017 that is a far more rapid departure than considered previously for residual forces a stillpending agreement with president hamid karzai of afghanistan would allow for an american presence to 2024 the obama administration is eager to maintain some military presence in afghanistan after this year , especially given the resurgence of islamist extremists and qaeda sympathizers that has exploited the united states' withdrawal from iraq and the regional chaos of the civil war in syria but mr karzai could foil any plans , as he has balked at signing a bilateral security agreement negotiated late last year to set out the conditions for a continued american presence in his country the white house would not respond to reports of the pentagon plan , and instead focused on keeping pressure on mr karzai to sign the security agreement without which any talk of keeping american troops in afghanistan is moot the president has not yet made decisions about final troop numbers , said caitlin m hayden , a spokeswoman for the national security council but absent a bilateral security agreement , she said , then we will initiate planning for a post2014 future in which there would be no us or nato troop presence in afghanistan that is not a future we are seeking , and we do not believe that it is in afghanistan s interests the further this slips into 2014 , however , the more likely such an outcome is , ms hayden added decisions have to be made soon , she said , about issues like base closings and force levels despite the tension now between the united states and mr karzai on the matter , the agreement negotiated included concessions from the afghans that the obama administration had not been able to secure from iraq in 2011 , which led to americans' complete withdrawal from that country chief among them was assurance that american soldiers would not face prosecution in afghanistan for actions in the course of their duties there also , special operations forces would be able to conduct antiterrorism raids in private afghan homes but mr karzai has since insisted on other conditions , while the united states has refused to reopen negotiations
minneapolis the amateur mindreading bothers kevin love the most , even though he caused most of it after all , it was love , the ' allstar power forward , who complained about the minnesota front office and his fouryear contract extension in an interview with yahoo sports and it was love who negotiated an optout clause , potentially making him a free agent after the third year , in 2015 so it has not taken much imagination for people in and around the nba to wonder if love perhaps the league s best power forward but never a playoff participant since entering the league in 2008 has decided to bolt from the perennially struggling timberwolves the minute he can for the more glamorous knicks or the los angeles lakers , although neither is doing any better than minnesota these days to love , however , none of this conjecture makes sense if he had checked out , as love put it , why did he fly back to minnesota last summer to meet with mayo clinic representatives about a new downtown practice center \? \( the timberwolves needed a project partner , and mayo ultimately signed on \) why , love asked , is he the liaison between the players and the center s design team \? why does he sit in on marketing meetings and talk to sponsors \? why did he take out a fullpage ad in the star tribune on feb 9 to thank timberwolves fans for helping make him an allstar starter for the first time \? and why does he take a continual physical pounding for a team struggling to reach 500 \? a lot of stuff had been said in the past , love , 25 , said after a recent practice at target center there s even stuff that came out two weeks ago , today , all over the place i'm invested in this team , and long term , i'm invested in this team i'm happy here yet the speculation continues a sideline encounter with the filmmaker and noted knicks fan spike lee at madison square garden on nov 3 , after love hit an offbalance bank shot to help beat the knicks the two clumsily clasped arms as love ran by only added to the rumors of love s interest in relocating to new york some backstory love has known lee for years , and they spoke that night at halftime and love used to watch lee s film he got game before his own high school games it was a pretty spontaneous move by me , love said of his courtside interlude with lee how many moments can you have like that , where spike s sitting right there , standing , kind of gawking at you , and you get to give him a little bit of dap \? he said of his greeting take advantage of it minnesota , not surprisingly , is determined to keep love last may , the timberwolves fired david kahn , their basketball operations director and the main target of love s scorn in the yahoo article , and part of the reason they did so is that kahn did not give love the maximum fiveyear extension he sought kahn s successor , the former nba coach flip saunders , has gone out of his way to repair the damage saunders goes to lunch with love once a week , picks his brain and promotes him as the face of the franchise at saunders s invitation , love represented the timberwolves at the lottery last may do i have a good relationship with him \? i think i do , saunders said i like his competitiveness i like him as a person off the floor as much as i like him on the floor because of that , you want to see a person like that be successful and i think he has a chance to be special here limited to 18 games last season by a twicebroken right hand , the 6foot10 love entered the allstar break among the nba s pergame leaders in scoring \( 258 points , fourth place \) and rebounding \( 132 , second \) lakers coach mike d'antoni called love s 3point shot lethal , though on saturday night , he did not make the final of the allstar 3point contest , finishing fifth out of eight competitors he won the event in 2012 saunders has challenged love , a terrific outlet passer , to average five assists a game that would lift his averages to more than 20 points , 10 rebounds and 5 assists numbers attained by hall of famers like larry bird , kareem abduljabbar and wilt chamberlain love is close , averaging 40 assists a game , second among nba power forwards to charlotte s josh mcroberts \( 41 \) love also took on more responsibility since the hulking center nikola pekovic sustained an achilles' tendon injury last month he has averaged 316 points and 151 rebounds in pekovic s absence love has had at least 30 points and 15 rebounds on seven occasions this season , leading the nba , and 25 times in his career , breaking kevin garnett s team record in 593 fewer games being the player that i am and the face of this franchise , i 've obviously got to carry most of the weight , as i should , love said minnesota coach rick adelman added he s been tremendous all that was evident in a 10999 victory over the lakers on feb 4 , as love drew one charge and fell hard to the court twice , the second time injuring his right hip and his neck with 4 minutes 10 seconds to play but with the timberwolves ahead by 9 , love refused to come out he sank two foul shots after a timeout and two more 25 seconds later he finished with 31 points and 17 rebounds in about 41 minutes , but he was too banged up to play the next night in oklahoma city love missed another game with a left quadriceps bruise before nearly posting a tripledouble \( 32 points , 11 rebounds and 8 assists \) in a 11790 blowout of denver last wednesday he s a soldier , the veteran backup center ronny turiaf said he s been very much trying to pick up his intensity and his effort on the defensive end , and that makes a big difference for everybody and , sometimes , vocally on jan 8 , when the backups dante cunningham and j j barea sulked instead of joining timeout huddles late in a 104103 loss to phoenix , love criticized them without mentioning their names we 're supposed to be a team , he told reporters saunders said he was steaming up in my suite when he saw what cunningham and barea were doing and praised love for taking on the issue despite all his efforts on the court , love has not exactly pulled his team along with him the 2528 timberwolves are 112 in games decided by 4 points or fewer , trail phoenix by six games for the last western conference playoff spot and need a big finish to avoid missing the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season that s a problem it is hard to imagine love sticking around if that continues we just need to win , he said i'm happy here i'm happy to win here as long as we win , it s all good with me because i'm having fun out there pekovic , perhaps love s closest friend on the team , faced a similar decision last summer and agreed to a fiveyear , 60 million extension to stay in minnesota he worried that love would choose differently if we can get to the point where we can fight for a playoff position , that would be really good , pekovic said we just need to push better , and i know that will help his decision whether to stay or not

kuala lumpur , malaysia a crucial stage in the fourweek search for the missing malaysia airlines plane began on friday as two military ships one from australia and the other from britain directed their sensor technology beneath the surface of the water and began the underwater phase of the hunt , hoping to pick up signs of wreckage lying at the bottom of the indian ocean the ships searched a single 150milelong track of the ocean floor , starting from opposite ends and converging in the middle , officials said both vessels are equipped with listening devices that can hear any pings from the plane s flight data and cockpit voice recorders , or black boxes the two ships the hms echo of the royal navy and the ocean shield of the royal australian navy were part of a deployment of 11 vessels involved in friday s search , about 1 , 050 miles off perth , australia the ships were joined by 10 military planes and four civilian jets , which conducted surveillance flights over the search zone throughout the day the ocean shield is outfitted with a socalled towed pinger locator , a batwingshaped device with a microphone that is towed below the vessel and can pick up any signals from flight 370 s black boxes a lot of hope is riding on the effectiveness of the underwater listening devices and on the estimates of the data from analysts who have designated the search zone as the most likely location of the plane s plunge into the ocean the black boxes' batteries , which have a life span of about a month , are expected to expire next week when they die , so will the pinger signal , leaving the boxes to rest mutely on the seabed and making their discovery far more difficult crews on the planes and other vessels continued to search for floating debris from the plane if debris is found and confirmed , it might help searchers determine the plane s point of entry into the ocean but while search coordinators said there were some sightings of objects reported by ships on friday , none of the items were linked to the missing plane we 'll continue the surface search for a good deal more time because if we find a piece of wreckage on the surface , or some evidence on the surface that the aircraft went into the water nearby , that gives us a much better datum to conduct the underwater search , said retired air chief marshal angus houston , the australian official overseeing the coordination of the search instead of searching over an area the size of ireland , we might be able to get into an area which is the size of the metropolitan area of perth , for example , he said during a news conference in perth mr houston said there was still a great possibility that searchers might find debris from the plane floating on the ocean surface on thursday , the search zone was adjusted farther northward from the area where searchers had been exploring for the last week the modification , mr houston said friday , was based on continuing groundbreaking and multidisciplinary technical analysis of satellite data and airplane performance there is nothing unusual about this , he added the search area will be adjusted on a semiregular basis

london these are tough times in half a million british children are going hungry , the government plans to cut public spending to a share of the economy not seen since the 1930s , and the honorable lords and ladies of the house of lords have come under attack for their champagne budget but hardship breeds revolt , even , it appears , by the peers of the realm the champagne wars , as some here call them , broke out in recent weeks after news that the lords and ladies had rejected a proposal a few years ago to save the taxpayers some money by merging the catering department of their chamber , the unelected upper house of parliament , with that of the house of commons , the elected lower chamber apparently , the lords feared that the quality of champagne would not be as good if they chose a joint service those words , from malcolm jack , a former clerk of the commons who was interviewed by a committee of lawmakers this month , caused some astonishment is that true \? did you make that up \? asked the chairman of the committee , jack straw , a former home secretary yes , it is true , mr jack replied the house of lords , which gets an annual catering subsidy of 13 million pounds , or 2 million , has spent 415 , 563 on about 17 , 000 bottles of champagne since the conservativeled government of prime minister david cameron took office in 2010 and started cutting public spending that is roughly five bottles for each of its 791 peers each year owen williams , a spokesman for the house of lords , disputed the idea that the proposal to merge the catering services had ever been discussed , calling mr jack s testimony inaccurate in an interview , mr williams also pointed out that the bubbly was not given to peers for free , but sold at a profit in their private bars and at banquets but at a time of widespread hunger and plans for deep budget cuts , that explanation did little to help the image of the lords and ladies the british news media condemned pampered peers and champagne charlies , questioning the rationale not only for a champagne budget but also for keeping a mostly appointed and still partly hereditary house a legislative chamber that is now the world s biggest , outside china , because no one is ever forced to retire the fact that their lordships might not want to choose from the same wine list as the plebs in the commons has raised the question again as to why britain still has an unelected upper house , the economist  news of the champagne budget has also sharpened the focus on the widening gap between the privileged few and those less fortunate while members of the house of lords can claim 300 a day simply for showing up , the number of people receiving emergency from the trussel trust the country s largest food bank charity on at least three days last year rose above 913 , 000 , a nearly threefold increase from the previous year a , jointly compiled with the church of england , urged lawmakers to face the simple but devastating fact that hunger stalks this country the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , who announced the report s release last week , described his shock at seeing people lining up outside frank field , a lawmaker from the labour party who helped to lead the inquiry that the report was based on , said half a million children lived in families that were unable to feed them , and in half of all british families , an adult skipped a meal each day something disturbing is happening , he told reporters families , devastated by wage stagnation and delays in benefit payments , are often only one bill away from crisis the report panel , which interviewed 155 witnesses and received 246 written submissions , said that its very existence would have been unthinkable 30 years ago , when the assumption was that nobody in britain could be hungry unless they wished to be the government has rejected the notion that four years of budget cuts have anything to do with the increasing use of food banks a , we should remember that this country has been through the deepest recession in living memory , and sticking to this government s longterm economic plan is the best way to improve living standards but the 86 billion in spending cuts implied by a budget by george osborne , the chancellor of the exchequer , were described as brutal the institute for fiscal studies , an economic policy think tank , said the cuts , scheduled between next year s general election and 2020 , might require a fundamental reimagining of the role of the state as economists and labor unions wondered whether the planned austerity measures would take britain back to the precariousness of victorian times or merely to something like the aftermath of , the office for budget responsibility , a nonpartisan economic think tank , calculated that if mr osborne followed through , government consumption of goods and services would fall to its lowest share of gross domestic product since 1938 one member of the house of lords , patrick jenkin , decided to set an example this week by retiring at age 88 he is urging his fellow octogenarians to do the same i see some of these extinct volcanoes sitting on the back bench of the labour party and they are just waiting for some money , he told the daily telegraph it is a great shame it ca n't go on meanwhile , anne jenkin , a conservative member of the house of lords who is the daughterinlaw of mr jenkin , offered her own explanation for the country s increasing hunger poor people do not know how to cook her bowl of porridge in the morning , ms jenkin said , costs 4 pence , far less than the sugary cereal poor people eat it turns out that ms jenkin is a member of the lords' refreshment committee , which is in charge of champagne procurement she later apologized for any offense her comments might have caused , but the damage was done ms jenkin s words quickly made headlines let them eat porridge ! the newspapers said
postcommunist countries can be likened to western societies operating with a time lag repeating the same debates that their western counterparts had some 10 years ago one such example is slovakia s current controversy over gay marriage and adoption by samesex couples although the institutionalization of gay marriages or child adoptions by samesex couples hardly figures on the agenda of most political parties , the country has come a long way since its first gay pride event in 2010 , which was disrupted by neonazi youths because it is probably just a matter of time until gay unions and samesex adoptions become palatable to most slovaks , opponents of these reforms have launched a preemptive assault to make these reforms legally and politically costly earlier this year , slovakia s christian democrats teamed up with the governing leftpopulist party , smer \( direction in slovak \) of prime minister robert fico to pass a constitutional amendment to protect the slovak family , vaguely reminiscent of the infamous defense of marriage act , overturned by the us supreme court last year since this past september , the constitution of slovakia thus stipulates that marriage is a union solely between man and woman the slovak republic fully protects marriage and provides all means to secure its wellbeing encouraged , slovakia s traditionalists are on the offensive following a petition organized by the civic campaign alliance for family , a nationwide referendum has been called for february to provide answers to several questions , including whether any form of partnership other than between a man and a woman could be called a marriage and whether a ban should be imposed on adoption of children by samesex couples the initial proposal contained another question whether any other form of cohabitation should be given the legal attributes of marriage which was ruled invalid by the country s constitutional court , as it could violate people s fundamental rights anton chromik , one of the leaders of the alliance for family , claims that homosexuals are not asking just for rights , ' but want to shut the mouths of other people they will be making decisions over other people s lives , careers , and that has always in history resulted in dictatorships and sometimes even in mass murders supporters of the campaign also question why professional psychological and psychiatric associations , or the world health organization , declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in the latter half of the 20th century , and point to allegedly successful examples of therapy provided to gay people for the government of prime minister fico , the controversy is a welcome though temporary distraction from some very real problems facing slovakia while its transition from communism was a success , the country is still plagued by rampant corruption , chronic unemployment exceeding 30 percent in some regions and by the intergenerational poverty of the sizeable roma population the country has also seen a geopolitical shift following russia s invasion of ukraine , with mr fico becoming one of the kremlin s leading apologists unsurprisingly , slovakia s antigay activists have a soft spot for vladimir putin , too former prime minister jan carnogursky , a former catholic dissident and an outspoken supporter of the referendum , noted recently that in russia , one would not even have to campaign for this over there , the protection of traditional christian values is an integral part of government policy and warned against the gender ideology exported from the united states the neighboring czech republic has applied its own version of civil partnerships of samesex couples since 2006 , with very little controversy largely because none of the doomsday predictions about the demise of the traditional family made by the law s opponents have materialized the slovak case is different , in part , because of the stronger religiosity of its population most churches have endorsed the alliance s campaign and some clergymen have played a role in heating up the rhetoric , making parallels between homosexuality and genocide , for example the advocates of gay unions appear frustrated by the onesidedness of the debate our arguments have been exhausted and tend to be repetitive because we are not lying , says romana schlesinger , one of the main organizers of the annual gay pride events in slovakia s capital , bratislava the other side is much more creative they will make up any argument , directed at anyone , just to appear persuasive it seems unlikely that slovak traditionalists will ultimately be on the winning side of this argument in the meantime , the meanspirited campaigning and frequent disparaging remarks about gays and their condition are a poor substitute for serious policy discussions and are making the country a much less pleasant place , and not just for its gay population
boston even before plays his final game for the , which is scheduled to take place here sunday , the focus has turned from jeter to from a cherished star to a tarnished one shortly before the whipped masahiro tanaka and the yankees , , on saturday at fenway park , yankees general manager revealed that he had recently spoken with rodriguez and that he exchanged text messages with rodriguez on friday as part of a process to reintegrate him for next season rodriguez is serving a seasonlong suspension for performanceenhancing drugs but is eligible to play in 2015 i 've already been talking to alex , personally , cashman said i just talked to alex about 10 days ago to try to get his thought process on what s the best way to come back and how to come back , whether winter ball , for instance a year ago , during the height of the tension between rodriguez and the yankees and major league baseball , cashman said he was wary of speaking with rodriguez because he did not want to risk becoming embroiled in a lawsuit at the time , rodriguez was suing or threatening to sue the yankees' team doctor , commissioner bud selig and the players union since then , rodriguez has dropped all lawsuits and has adopted a more conciliatory approach to his team and his sport , a strategy designed by his lawyer jim sharp cashman described his exchanges with rodriguez , including one earlier this season , as fruitful and cordial very professional , cashman said when you deal with alex on baseball , it s always good the 2015 season was also on the mind of manager on thursday , when he addressed his team before  citing unnamed witnesses , published saturday described girardi as angrily chastising some of his players for being overweight and some of them for not being hungry enough girardi acknowledged addressing his team but disputed that characterization , saying he was just direct in telling his players what was expected in 2015 girardi said that the timing of the meeting was not intended to interfere with jeter s final day at the stadium and that it made sense because the yankees  we 're all disappointed we did n't make the playoffs , but i addressed the team because it s easier to do it at our ballpark and we need to be better , girardi said we need to execute better next year girardi said at various points this season that his players were not quitting , and he said saturday that he continued to hold that view until the point of elimination these guys never gave up on us , he said they kept playing and kept playing , and we went through difficult things , and they kept fighting and fighting for that , i was proud of them but i wanted to let them know what we expect next year none of us are happy we are not playing next week with rodriguez , there never seems to be a question of whether he is working hard cashman said rodriguez had been working out diligently on his own in miami and at ucla and was eager to return he said rodriguez did not express an interest in playing winter ball , although cashman did not seem particularly inclined to have him do it , either cashman would not say what role the yankees had in mind for rodriguez next year , whether as third baseman , the first baseman or strictly at designated hitter he did say , however , that the hostility of the past had been eliminated and that it was now a matter of getting rodriguez back on the field it was n't a healthy process for anybody involved , cashman said of last season s investigation and suspension but the process had finality , and now it s about moving forward girardi , discussing who would replace jeter as the yankees' captain and leader , also spoke about rodriguez girardi suggested the team should wait before appointing another captain it very likely will not have one for a long time but said rodriguez had some leadership qualities alex , at heart , is a teacher , girardi said he likes to teach the game and where you 're supposed to be and how to play the position he loves to talk hitting alex loves to talk about the game of a more formal leadership role , though , girardi added , i do n't necessarily think he would seek that in the meantime , it is still jeter s team , and there is still one game left after taking a day to decompress from the emotions of thursday s yankee stadium farewell , jeter went 1 for 2 as the designated hitter saturday , with an infield single the hit was his 3 , 464th , coming in his 2 , 746th game jeter told girardi before the game that he wanted only two atbats , and when francisco cervelli pinchhit for him in the fifth inning , he was booed jeter said after the game that despite feeling a twinge in his hamstring while running to first , he would play sunday there is sadness for me , girardi said you never want to see great players leave

one of my sharpest memories of elementary school is the way that teachers the young , pretty , married ones would occasionally just disappear one day they would be in the classroom , looking as they always did , and the next day they would be gone , replaced by a substitute in reality , the new teacher over the summer or during the next school year , you might catch a glimpse of the mysteriously vanished teacher at the grocery store , pushing a baby carriage where had the baby come from \? the pattern became clear once a teacher even began thinking about having a baby , the classroom was no place for her or any likeminded woman what i was witnessing , i learned much later , was the effect of an employment policy that was nearly ubiquitous into the 1970s pregnant teachers were required to inform their supervisors of a pregnancy and to go on unpaid maternity leave as many as five months before their due date , to avoid appearing visibly pregnant in front of a classroom of young children \( that was n't the stated reason , of course usually there was no stated reason , because school systems were n't required to give one \) the leave often came with no guarantee of reemployment , or with a backtowork date set many months after childbirth , regardless of the new mother s desire to come back sooner the message was obvious a mother s place was at home my memory is of course prompted by the pregnancy discrimination case argued last week at the peggy young was a driver for united parcel service who was instructed by her obstetrician not to lift more than 20 pounds during her pregnancy ups drivers are expected to carry packages of up to 70 pounds , although the company offered accommodations to three categories of employees those injured on the job those with conditions recognized as disabilities under the americans with disabilities act and those who for a variety of reasons , often healthrelated , lost their commercial driver s certification since pregnancy fits none of these categories , ups refused to offer temporary light duty to ms young she went on unpaid leave and sued the company her claim was that the ups nonaccommodation policy violated the pregnancy discrimination act of 1978 , a federal law providing that women affected by pregnancy , childbirth , or related medical conditions shall be treated the same as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work she lost both in federal district court and in the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit , in richmond , va the pregnancy discrimination act was a nondiscrimination statute , and ups was n't discriminating on the basis of pregnancy , the appeals court held in its 2013 decision the company s policy said nothing about pregnancy , much less singled it out for disfavored treatment ms young , the court said , was simply not similar to the employees who qualified for accommodations the court concluded that to find otherwise would be to transform the law and imbue it with a preferential treatment mandate that congress neither intended nor enacted there is logic to that parsing of the statute , and it presented ms young s lawyer , samuel r bagenstos , with a substantial obstacle last week four times during the , justice described ms young s legal position as seeking most favored nation status for pregnancy , an entitlement to special treatment not available to other employees who sought accommodations but who likewise fell outside the neutrally defined eligibility categories justice scalia s harping on the most favored nation image \( which he borrowed from the \) led justice in turn to accuse the company of seeking least favored nation treatment for pregnancy justice ginsburg challenged the ups lawyer , caitlin j halligan , to provide a single instance of anyone who needed a lifting dispensation who did n't get it except for pregnant people back in the 1970s , the pregnant teachers also brought lawsuits they prevailed the supreme court ruled in a that the mandatory leave policies were so arbitrary and irrational as to violate the constitutional guarantee of due process the conclusive presumption that every pregnant teacher who reaches the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy is physically incapable of continuing simply could n't be defended , justice potter stewart wrote for the court in cleveland board of education v lafleur the vote was 7 to 2 at first glance , the pregnant teachers' cases and their denouement look like artifacts from an earlier age it s worth noting that although the plaintiffs challenged the policies as discriminatory on the basis of sex in violation of the 14th amendment s guarantee of equal protection and the cleveland plaintiff had won her case on that basis in the lower court , equality was a step too far for the justices the supreme court decision studiously avoided treating pregnancy discrimination as sex discrimination , and in fact the court that the two discrimination claims were not linked as a legal matter after all , did n't the category of nonpregnant persons at any given time also include women \? \( it was this 1976 decision , general electric company v gilbert , that congress overruled when it passed the pregnancy discrimination act the act amended title vii , the basic federal law against employment discrimination , by declaring that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was indeed a form of sex discrimination as a matter of federal law \) the court issued the pregnant teachers decision on jan 21 , 1974 one day short of the oneyear anniversary of another 7to2 decision , roe v wade it s fascinating that a court that dealt so confidently with the right to abortion \( although the roe decision is more accurately read as the right of doctors to perform abortions \) needed to go through such doctrinal contortions a year later to enable women to teach while pregnant so at second glance , maybe there s not such distance between the pregnant teachers' case and the case the supreme court heard last week , young v united parcel service pregnancy still seems to knock the legal system off its stride , evoking in judges and employers alike a kind of tunnel vision that makes pregnancy the exception to any rule if there s a pregnant woman on the scene , the answer to the question which of these things is not like the other \? always turns out to be her logical as the company s rigidly formalistic argument is , there is also compelling logic in an alternative reading of the statutory injunction to treat pregnant employees the same as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work the pregnancy discrimination act requires a comparison the same as who \? similar to whom \? any employee who needs and receives a temporary accommodation to a physical condition is hardly a crazy reading of the statute , certainly not in the context of its enactment in response to a court of nine men who were categorically unable to see pregnancy discrimination at all early in last week s argument , justice addressed a comment to ms young s lawyer there was a quite easy way for you to win , justice breyer said , and that would be to bring a disparate impact claim such a claim would be a beautiful vehicle , the justice added his comment did n't receive much attention in accounts of the argument , probably because it was n't really helpful the time being long past for ms young to amend her complaint or maybe because it required some context beyond the confines of this case to understand what justice breyer was driving at ms young filed her case as one of disparate treatment , which required her to prove that she had been singled out for treatment that violated the law but the supreme court has interpreted title vii , of which the pregnancy discrimination act is a part , as also prohibiting employment practices that have a discriminatory effect on a protected group in a foundational 1971 decision , , the court invalidated a southern utility company s requirement that applicants for lowlevel bluecollar jobs have a high school diploma , a requirement that had the effect of screening out nearly all africanamericans in the local labor pool the fact that the utility s policy was neutrally worded , saying nothing about race , did n't save it from a finding that the company was in violation of title vii s prohibition of racial discrimination likewise , a policy requiring all workers to be able to lift 70 pounds need not say anything about pregnancy to make it impossible for many pregnant women to remain on the job that justice breyer thinks this would have been a beautiful way for ms young to win her case is of more than passing interest disparate impact theory , which relieves plaintiffs of the often hopeless task of having to prove intentional discrimination , is under sustained attack from the court s conservatives , who have repeatedly tried to find cases with which to challenge its continued availability one such case , , challenging whether the federal fair housing act permits a disparateimpact analysis , is on the court s docket for decision this term , scheduled for argument on jan 21 or maybe justice breyer was simply expressing a regretful expectation that as presently constructed , ms young s pregnancy discrimination case is a supreme court loser certainly there s a fair chance that it is but here s a footnote as the time approached this fall for ups to file its supreme court brief , the company did some heavy lifting of its own and decided it needed to reconsider not its legal position , which its lawyer defended vigorously , but its policy on page 24 of its brief , the company revealed that on a goingforward basis , ups has voluntarily decided to provide additional accommodations for pregnancyrelated physical limitations as a matter of corporate discretion pregnant employees who have physical restrictions will now be offered lightduty accommodations on the same basis as employees with similar restrictions resulting from onthejob injuries in other words , they will be treated , as a plain reading of the law suggests , the same a supreme court discrimination case with a happy ending \? peggy young may not win her case , but she will be a winner nonetheless

fine physically and refused to blame his performance on fatigue i just stunk , he said it s not how i felt , it s how i pitched nelson cruz led off the ninth with a double , and steve pearce followed with another double , scoring pinchrunner quintin berry to even the score one out later , kelly johnson , an exyankee , slapped a single into the gap in rightcenter field , igniting a hometown celebration for the firstplace orioles with the loss , the yankees fell to five games back in the chase for the wildcard spot with 14 games remaining it was a difficult result for the yankees to sustain , especially as kuroda once again pitched well enough to win , but once again it was not good enough with a simple groundout to third base by nick hundley in the third inning , kuroda recorded his 3 , 000th inning pitched , including games in japan and the united states that is not a statistic glorified in the record books , but it is representative of the solid work kuroda , 40 , has done both here and in japan other pitchers have thrown more roger clemens had more than 4 , 000 innings all in major league baseball while he was still 40 , and hideo nomo recorded 3 , 0272 3 , including 9761 3 in japan many of kuroda s 3 , 000 innings looked a lot like the kind that he threw sunday he threw seven strong innings , allowed only one run and walked none , and did not get a win he is used to that kuroda came into the game with a 7879 record in 208 career starts and one relief appearance over four years with the los angeles dodgers and three with the yankees his career earned run average of 347 would normally indicate a better wonloss record , but kuroda has often suffered from lack of run support , going back to his days in los angeles his career run support per nine innings is 40 , but this year it is only 37 with the yankees' unproductive offense last year it was worse just 32 per nine innings , which helps explain why he went 1113 , despite a 331 era kuroda might best be described as talented , professional and determined as a pitcher he has also been a hardluck pitcher much of the time thirty of his 79 losses going into sunday had come in socalled quality starts , where he allowed three or fewer runs in at least six innings he has also lost out on 23 potential wins in games that were lost by the bullpen when he was in a position to win it four of those have come this year on sunday , kuroda was pitching on a knife s edge throughout the yankees scored first on martin prado s secondinning home run , and kuroda made it stand for four innings until the orioles finally broke through with one out , alejandro de aza singled to center and scored when the next batter , adam jones , ripped a double over the head of prado at third base the ball was scorched , but it was on a trajectory to go foul prado jumped and deflected it with his glove , turning it into a fair ball there was still only one out with jones on second base , kuroda got the everdangerous nelson cruz to ground out to prado at third , but pearce reached on an infield single that sent jones to third , 90 feet away from giving the orioles the lead but with his 87th pitch , kuroda got j j hardy to pop up to stephen drew at second , stranding jones in the seventh inning , he set the orioles down in order , giving him 3 , 0042 3 combined innings 1 , 3041 3 in the majors and 1 , 7001 3 in japan before the game , the orioles honored derek jeter , who spoke before the game about how much he liked baltimore as a baseball town and how he had loved playing at camden yards for everything it contained , from the atmosphere to the playing surface he also discussed his recent slump \( he went 0 for 4 and is hitless in his last six games \) the only result i'm concerned about is us trying to win today , he said before the game trust me , i want to do probably better than most people every single time that i play that s not the case good times , bad times , but you have to be able to forget it at this point in the season , our no 1 goal is to try and win games inside pitch carlos beltran , who had not played since tuesday because of a bone chip in his elbow , pinchhit in the seventh inning but struck out dellin betances struck out two batters to tie mariano rivera s record of 130 strikeouts for a yankee relief pitcher masahiro tanaka , who is recovering from an injured elbow , will throw a simulated game monday in tampa , fla , and if all goes well , his next start probably will be five or six days later in a real game at yankee stadium
cairo battling palestinian militants in gaza two years ago , israel found itself pressed from all sides by unfriendly arab neighbors to end the fighting not this time after the military ouster of the islamist government in cairo last year , egypt has led a new coalition of arab states including jordan , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates that has effectively lined up with israel in its fight against hamas , the islamist movement that controls the gaza strip that , in turn , may have contributed to the failure of the antagonists to reach a negotiated ceasefire even after more than three weeks of bloodshed the arab states' loathing and fear of political islam is so strong that it outweighs their allergy to benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister of israel , said aaron david miller , a scholar at the wilson center in washington and a former middle east negotiator under several presidents i have never seen a situation like it , where you have so many arab states acquiescing in the death and destruction in gaza and the pummeling of hamas , he said the silence is deafening although egypt is traditionally the key gobetween in any talks with hamas deemed a terrorist group by the united states and israel the government in cairo this time surprised hamas by publicly proposing a ceasefire agreement that met most of israel s demands and none from the palestinian group hamas was tarred as intransigent when it immediately rejected it , and cairo has continued to insist that its proposal remains the starting point for any further discussions but as commentators sympathetic to the palestinians slammed the proposal as a ruse to embarrass hamas , egypt s arab allies praised it king abdullah of saudi arabia called president abdel fattah elsisi of egypt the next day to commend it , mr sisi s office said , in a statement that cast no blame on israel but referred only to the bloodshed of innocent civilians who are paying the price for a military confrontation for which they are not responsible there is clearly a convergence of interests of these various regimes with israel , said khaled elgindy , a former adviser to palestinian negotiators who is now a fellow at the brookings institution in washington in the battle with hamas , mr elgindy said , the egyptian fight against the forces of political islam and the israeli struggle against palestinian militants were nearly identical whose proxy war is it \? he asked the dynamic has inverted all expectations of the arab spring uprisings as recently as 18 months ago , most analysts in israel , washington and the palestinian territories expected the popular uprisings to make the arab governments more responsive to their citizens , and therefore more sympathetic to the palestinians and more hostile to israel but instead of becoming more isolated , israel s government has emerged for the moment as an unexpected beneficiary of the ensuing tumult , now tacitly supported by the leaders of the resurgent conservative order as an ally in their common fight against political islam egyptian officials have directly or implicitly blamed hamas instead of israel for palestinian deaths in the fighting , even when , for example , united nations schools have been hit by israeli shells , something that occurred again on wednesday and the progovernment egyptian news media has continued to rail against hamas as a tool of a regional islamist plot to destabilize egypt and the region , just as it has since the military ouster of president mohamed morsi of the muslim brotherhood one year ago \( egyptian prosecutors have charged hamas with instigating violence in egypt , killing its soldiers and police officers , and even breaking mr morsi and other brotherhood leaders out of jail during the 2011 uprising \) the diatribes against hamas by at least one popular progovernment talk show host in egypt were so extreme that the government of israel broadcast some of them into gaza they use it to say , see , your supposed friends are encouraging us to kill you ! ' maisam abumorr , a palestinian student in gaza city , said in a telephone interview some progovernment egyptian talk shows broadcast in gaza are saying the egyptian army should help the israeli army get rid of hamas , she said at the same time , egypt has infuriated gazans by continuing its policy of shutting down tunnels used for crossborder smuggling into the gaza strip and keeping border crossings closed , exacerbating a scarcity of food , water and medical supplies after three weeks of fighting sisi is worse than netanyahu , and the egyptians are conspiring against us more than the jews , said salhan alhirish , a storekeeper in the northern gaza town of beit lahiya they finished the brotherhood in egypt , and now they are going after hamas egypt and other arab states , especially the persian gulf monarchies of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates , are finding themselves allied with israel in a common opposition to iran , a rival regional power that has a history of funding and arming hamas for washington , the shift poses new obstacles to its efforts to end the fighting although egyptian intelligence agencies continue to talk with hamas , as they did under former president hosni mubarak and mr morsi , cairo s new animosity toward the group has called into question the effectiveness of that channel , especially after the response to egypt s first proposal as a result , secretary of state john kerry turned to the more islamistfriendly states of qatar and turkey as alternative mediators two states that grew in regional stature with the rising tide of political islam after the arab spring , and that have suffered a degree of isolation as that tide has ebbed but that move has put mr kerry in the incongruous position of appearing to some analysts as less hostile to hamas and thus less supportive of israel than egypt or its arab allies for israeli hawks , the change in the arab states has been relatively liberating the reading here is that , aside from hamas and qatar , most of the arab governments are either indifferent or willing to follow the leadership of egypt , said martin kramer , president of shalem college in jerusalem and an americanisraeli scholar of islamist and arab politics no one in the arab world is going to the americans and telling them , stop it now , ' as saudi arabia did , for example , in response to earlier israeli crackdowns on the palestinians , he said that gives the israelis leeway with the resurgence of the antiislamist , militarybacked government in cairo , mr kramer said , the new egyptian government and allies like saudi arabia appear to believe that the palestinian people are to bear the suffering in order to defeat hamas , because hamas cannot be allowed to triumph and cannot be allowed to emerge as the most powerful palestinian player egyptian officials disputed that characterization , arguing that the new government was maintaining its support for the palestinian people despite its deteriorating relations with hamas , and that it had grown no closer to israel than it was under mr morsi or mr mubarak we have a historical responsibility toward the palestinians , and that is not related to our stance on any specific faction , said a senior egyptian diplomat , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks hamas is not gaza , and gaza is not palestine egyptian officials noted that the egyptian military and the red crescent had delivered medical supplies and other aid to gaza cairo continues to keep open lines of communication with hamas , including allowing a senior hamas official , moussa abu marzouq , to reside in cairo other analysts , though , argued that egypt and its arab allies were trying to balance their own overriding dislike for hamas against their citizens' emotional support for the palestinians , a balancing act that could grow more challenging as the gaza carnage mounts the pendulum of the arab spring has swung in israel s favor , just like it had earlier swung in the opposite direction , said mr elgindy , the former palestinian adviser but i am not sure the story is finished at this point
paris the future of spanish tennis may not be spanish in the future garbi e muguruza , the last unseeded player remaining in the women s singles draw at the , upset serena williams in the second round and was to get a crack at maria sharapova in the quarterfinals tuesday for now , the 20yearold muguruza represents spain , which is where she has long been based and is the country of her father , but she may well decide before the end of the year to represent venezuela , which is where she was born and is the country of her mother her decision , which she expects to make in october or november , will come at a pivotal time for spain , the tennis superpower that is showing clear signs of resurgence in the women s game and still has at no 1 in the men s game along with 13 other spanish men in the top 100 but muguruza is the only rising spanish \( or venezuelan \) woman with clear top10 potential , and nearly all of spain s top100 men s players are wellestablished veterans several are older than 30 , and only one is under 26 the 68thranked pablo carreno busta , who is 22 and though there have been some promising junior results of late , there is also only one spanish man under age 27 ranked between 100 and 200 where is the rest of the next generation \? pablo has a good level of tennis and is very good person , nadal said in a recent interview with the spanish website i get along with him very well and wish the best for him , but how old is he \? twentytwo \? it s not like he s 18 he s got plenty of road ahead of him , but he s 22 already and the next ones coming after that , we still do n't see them spain s recent economic struggles perhaps have played a role for nadal , part of the explanation is that players are maturing later in general \( no teenager is in the top 100 from any nation \) and that young spaniards are focusing more on the international tennis federation junior circuit instead of forging their games against their elders in professional satellite events , as nadal did playing against older people forces you to find solutions , he said you have to adapt to the speed earlier , and that matures you that said , you cannot plan for a champion like nadal he just happens but you can understand nadal s concern about the next wave , considering that he won his first french open at age 19 and was no 1 in the world by age 22 you can also understand nadal s concern , considering he turns 28 on tuesday and that the secondbest spanish player of his era , david ferrer , turned 32 in april nadal beat ferrer in the french open final last year , and they will meet in the quarterfinals this year both advanced monday , with the fifthseeded ferrer defusing kevin anderson , the towering south african , 63 , 63 , 67 \( 5 \) , 61 , and with nadal manhandling 83rdranked dusan lajovic of serbia , 61 , 62 , 61 this has hardly been nadal s finest claycourt season , with three defeats and only one masters 1000 title in madrid but in his first four matches at roland garros , he has not lost a set or even been pushed to a tiebreaker the draw has been very kind , but he has fully capitalized , losing only 23 games in reaching the quarterfinals he has spoken \( when asked \) about his back pain significant , given that back problems probably cost him the final of this year s australian open against stan wawrinka but ferrer , who has heard his share of greatly exaggerated rumors of nadal s demise over the years , did not sound convinced that the door to nadal s kingdom was finally ajar he won , 61 , 62 , 61 , so i do n't think his back pain bothered him very much , ferrer said he is capable of winning on every surface but especially on clay ferrer can at least count himself among the few who have beaten nadal more than once on clay , and he defeated him most recently in april in straight sets in the quarterfinals in monte carlo he also won their last match in paris , in the semifinals of the masters 1000 indoors event at the bercy arena late last season that is all very affirming , but ferrer knows better than anyone that nadal is in a different league with 13 grand slam singles titles , including a record eight french opens , to his none the headtohead record is also 216 in nadal s favor so just how do you destabilize nadal on clay \? by playing very , very well technically , by playing aggressively and limiting the errors , ferrer said and above all by being ready to resist his rhythm for long hours that sounds like a great deal of manual labor , which helps explain why nadal is an astonishing 631 at roland garros , his only loss coming in the fourth round in 2009 to robin soderling since then , he has reeled off 32 consecutive victories at the french open two other spanish veterans failed to reach the quarterfinals monday 30yearold guillermo garc al pez lost to ga l monfils , and fernando verdasco , also 30 , lost to andy murray , both in straight sets but the spanish women , like the men , have two representatives in the final eight muguruza and carla su rez navarro , who played doubles together monday and are now in the quarterfinals of that event , too it was hard to imagine that muguruza and su rez would not be playing fed cup together for spain but muguruza repeatedly has made it clear that she feels a strong connection to both her countries i do n't sense that they 're fighting over it , she said what matters to me is that both countries respect me a lot , and have given me all the time i need spain is clearly the stronger tennis nation , but venezuelan tennis officials who have not seen a talent like muguruza since nicolas pereira was the world s no 1 junior in 1988 have been actively lobbying muguruza has bigstage presence and bigtitle potential she is tall and lean with great leverage and , is an aggressive flat hitter who would rather end a rally in a hurry than extend it and wait for the ideal opportunity sharapova , still the heavy favorite tuesday , has been one of her role models , and she should look and sound very familiar to the russian with her quickstrike mentality , her power and , less felicitously , her shrieks if muguruza pulls off another upset , she will do it with spain beside her name on the draw , but the big question is whether she will keep winning for spain in the years to come

boston in 1950 , gordon parks was the only africanamerican photographer working for life magazine , a rising star who was gaining the power to call his own shots , and he proposed a cover story both highly political and deeply personal to return to fort scott , kan , the prairie town where he had grown up , to find his 11 classmates in a segregated middle school the magazine agreed , and in the spring parks drove back into his hometown for the first time in 23 years , taking , as he wrote later , a long hungry look at the red brick school where he had been educated , a school still segregated in 1950 none of us understood why the first years of our education were separated from those of the white nor did we bother to ask , parks wrote the situation existed when we were born we waded in normal at the tender age of 6 and swam out maladjusted and complexed nine years later for reasons that remain unclear , life never published those words or the powerful pictures parks took of nine of his classmates , and their stories have remained in the time capsule of his archives for more than half a century but an opening jan 17 at the museum of fine arts here will at long last bring the work to light , at a time when racial unrest and de facto segregation in many american cities give it a new kind of relevance the story would have been the only life cover in those years other than one about breaking the color barrier to show africanamericans , and i think it would have had a big impact , said karen e haas , the show s curator i just really wanted to figure out what had happened to it and see what was there parks , raised in a poor tenantfarming family , became one of the most celebrated photographers of his generation , not only because of his images , which often held a up to american racism , but also because of his writing his memoirs and the semiautobiographical novel the learning tree and his 1971 action movie , which helped open new avenues for black actors and directors ms haas has pieced together the unpublished fort scott article s history through original prints held at the , in pleasantville , ny , and documents in the archive of parks s papers at in kansas and she ended up going much further than most curators might in search of her subject in the fall , she and her husband , greg heins , a photographer and director of the museum s photo studio , took to the road through the midwest in a kind of reverse great migration , from chicago to fort scott to find children and grandchildren of parks s classmates , using decadesold addresses from parks s notes it was an odd sort of vacation for the two of us , you might say , mr heins said in the end , at each address they visited , not a single home of the classmates parks photographed was still standing , a sad testament , at least in part , to the fate of africanamerican neighborhoods in chicago , detroit , st louis and columbus , ohio , where the graduates had moved to find work and better lives i remember thinking , well , at least i know the house for the address i have in fort scott itself will still be there , ' ms haas recalled in a recent interview at the museum and when i saw that it was gone , too , i literally cried the lives of the classmates six girls and five boys who graduated from the segregated plaza school in 1927 , in what was then a town of 10 , 000 people present a miniature snapshot of africanamerican aspiration and struggle in the years before brown v board of education or the civil rights movement parks found emma jane wells in kansas city , mo , where she sold clothes doortodoor to supplement her husband s salary at a paperbag factory peter thomason lived a few blocks away , working for the post office , one of the best jobs available to black men at the time but others from the class led much more precarious lives parks tracked down mazel morgan on the south side of chicago , in a transient hotel with her husband , who parks said robbed him at gunpoint after a photo session morgan s middleschool yearbook description had been ebullient \( tee hee , tee ho , tee hi , ha hum jolly , goodnatured , full of fun \) , but in 1950 she told parks , i 've felt dead so long that i do n't figure suicide is worthwhile anymore the most promising of the classmates , donald beatty , lived in an integrated neighborhood in columbus , ohio , where he had a highly desirable job as a supervisor at a state agency and where parks s pictures show him very much in the vernacular of life magazine s eisenhowerera domestic scenes happy and secure with his wife and toddler son and a brandnew buick but notes made by a life factchecker just a year later , when the magazine planned once again to run parks s article , recorded a tragedy , blithely and with no explanation aside from the death of their son , nothing much has happened to them lorraine madway , curator of wichita state university s special collections , said of the fort scott story there are those moments in an archive when you know you 've found the gold , and this is one of them it s a wonderful example of microhistory it s not only that there is so much material written at a specific time in people s lives , but then there are parks s reflections on it later since its formation in 2007 , a year after at 93 , the gordon parks foundation has collaborated with three museums the , the and the to organize small , highly focused exhibitions that delve into single bodies of life magazine work , much of it not seen in years \( all but a few of the 42 photographs in gordon parks back to fort scott , the show at the museum of fine arts , have never been published or exhibited before \) ms haas approached peter w kunhardt jr , the foundation s executive director , after following the historical thread of a parks picture in the museum of fine arts collection showing a young black couple on a date , standing outside a segregated movie theater ms haas had never known when or where the picture was taken parks used it later in his career without identifying it as part of an unpublished life article after discovering that the picture showed the liberty theater in his hometown , ms haas became intrigued , and with help from the gordon parks museum at fort scott community college , began to dig deeper in the archives , a journey that eventually led her back to fort scott , now a town of 8 , 000 gordon was very disappointed that the story never ran , said mr kunhardt , whose grandfather , philip b kunhardt was an editor and close friend of parks s at life he was really going back to a place that meant everything to him , and he wanted to use it to say something important besides factchecking notes , parks s own notes and a typewritten draft for what might have been his introduction to the photo spread , there is almost no other documentation surrounding the project , for which parks shot about 30 rolls of 35millimeter and mediumformat film and so the question of why it was not published might never be answered in an essay for the show s catalog , ms haas speculates that it might have been doomed by its very newsworthiness , as national challenges to school segregation began gathering speed and life waited in the end too long for just the right moment even with the help of a genealogist , ms haas has reached only dead ends over several months in trying to track down descendants of the classmates , a search that she says really has become a kind of obsession she did find the young man james lewis , the son of a doctor in fort scott standing outside the liberty theater but when she reached mr lewis , now in his 80s , by phone in california and told him the subject of her research , he hung up on her his family told her that his memories of growing up in fort scott remained too painful parks carried his own psychic wounds from those years , which profoundly shaped his writing and approach to photography but his feelings were always bittersweet though he lived for many years in new york city , he chose to be buried in his hometown , whose africanamerican population has declined even more markedly than its overall population in a 1968 poem about his childhood , he wrote that he would miss this kansas land that i was leaving , one of wide prairies filled with green and cornstalk , of the winding sound of crickets rubbing dampness from wings and silver september rain then he added yes , all this i would miss along with the fear , hatred and violence we blacks had suffered upon this beautiful land

boston the united states figure skating championships had not yet opened thursday when a skater had a wardrobe malfunction at ice dance practice not to worry her mother s flying in with a zipper , said jan o'neill , a volunteer seamstress who has made and repaired skating costumes for 25 years across the hall in the warmup area at td garden , paul loder sat in a trailer with the tools of a skate technician screwdrivers , pliers , drills , awls , glue , a blade sharpener and a sewing machine designed for saddle leather a 12yearold girl came to the door , needing her blades sharpened before the opening ceremony earlier , loder had glued a split seam on a boot and sharpened another pair of blades that seemed oddly distressed i do n't know what the girl did , he said it looked like she walked through the parking lot of the 500 volunteers at these championships , which will help determine the american team for next month s winter olympics in sochi , russia , perhaps none provide more urgent service than the five seamstresses and three technicians who repair costumes and skates they come in handy , said michelle kwan , the retired twotime olympic medalist and fivetime world champion if your zipper does n't work , you 're in trouble at the elite level , costumes can cost thousands of dollars custommade boots run 600 to 700 , with an additional 800 for the blades , and they must withstand tremendous force every time a skater lands on the ice after two , three or four revolutions in the air a malfunction can leave a competitor embarrassed , exposed and even in danger at the 1993 national championships , tonya harding had to restart her short program after she popped both her opening lutz jump and the hook on the back of her sleeveless dress at the 1994 olympics in lillehammer , norway , she restarted her long program after a skate lace broke at the 1988 calgary olympics , feathers were added to the bottom of a revealing costume worn by the gold medalist katarina witt of east germany in a sort of cold war fashion salvo , a canadian coach complained that witt s costume was bizarre and indecent and suggested that she was trying to mesmerize the judges with something other than her compulsory figures a dress code , known informally as the katarina rule , was later established at these championships , no surplus feathers will be available at the costume repair table we 'd have to go out and find a bird , said barb fritz , a seamstress who has made costumes for 20 years no extra sequins or rhinestones are available either the last time the national championships were held in boston , in 2001 , skaters could even get their hair and nails done at the rink \( we had a whole salon down there , o'neill said \) now , in the name of professionalism , competitors are expected to show up independently coifed and costumed they want them to come prepared , fritz said they do n't want them to show up and say , here s my dress could you put some sparkles on it \? ' still , a sewing machine is backstage at the ready for structural repairs to seams and straps and fasteners a kit resembling a fishing tackle box is stocked with scissors , threaded needles , duct tape , safety pins , glue , a spot remover pen , snaps , hooks and a tape measure it s like a doctor s bag , o'neill said we 're doctors of lycra a robe is available if a skater must remove a costume so is hair spray , which works as a temporary fix on fabric tears caused by wayward blades fritz also dyed some elastic in tea to make it flesh colored for the most vulnerable part of a woman s skating costume the straps usually they 're sewn in for life , fritz said but it depends on who does the sewing if the seamstress did n't know you 're going to be thrown and caught , it might not be as secure as it should be not everyone who makes costumes for skating knows what skating is all about one strict request is made of the volunteers they are not to speak to the skaters unless the skaters ask for help \( it gives them too much stress , o'neill said \) and they are not expected to perform miracles some incidents are beyond the reach of even the most skilled in costume restoration john zimmerman , a coach and former threetime national pairs champion , once hurried into a new costume while the dye was still drying after i got done performing , zimmerman said , i took it off and i was purple the fit of a boot and the positioning of the blades are as personal for skaters as fingerprints some travel with only one pair of boots the risk of losing skates has grown since sept 11 because some airlines , considering the blades a potential weapon , require that they be checked in luggage instead of carried on planes and a missing or broken skate can cause panic or ruin an entire competition in october at skate america , a stop on the grand prix circuit in detroit , adam rippon of the united states attempted a fourrevolution jump during practice and broke the heel of his right boot a technician from the boot manufacturer drove more than three hours from toronto with a new pair , only to be told that rippon preferred that the damaged boot be repaired so the technician drove to a walmart bought glue , screws and a drill placed a metal plate inside the boot and reattached the heel in his hotel room rippon finished second in the competition i was one step away from bubble gum and plastic ropes , he said at the time at the 2001 world championships in vancouver , british columbia , kwan was warming up before the qualifying round when the heel of her right boot became detached from the sole if the boot could not be repaired before it was her turn to skate , she would be disqualified pound the nail back in , kwan said she told a reluctant skate technician if you do n't , my world championship is over the boot was hastily repaired with the help of her father kwan won the qualifying round and , eventually , the fourth of her five world titles it felt a little tilted and i could feel the head of the nails , but it hung together , kwan recalled i won and i skated a clean program
on april 12 , 1864 the third anniversary of the firing on fort sumter a confederate force led by the brilliant and brutal nathan bedford forrest attacked union troops holding fort pillow , an obscure post in west tennessee what happened after forrest s men captured fort pillow remains one of the most notorious and controversial incidents of the civil war fort pillow sat on a bluff overlooking the mississippi river , about 40 miles north of memphis the confederates had built it early in the war using slave labor soon after , union forces captured it as they poured down from kentucky although the sprawling , isolated base had little military value , it had become something of a mecca for escaped slaves and northern businessmen , and a hotel , store and contraband village complemented the two miles of outer defenses and crescentshaped inner fort fort pillow s garrison consisted of the 13th tennessee cavalry a battalion of unionists and rebel deserters and elements of the second and sixth united states colored artillery regiments the fort was thus held by an uneasy combination of white southerners and black freedmen although both units included men from the local area , there was some hostility between them the troops were led by 25yearold maj lionel f booth , a capable career soldier in the spring of 1864 several thousand enemy horsemen under forrest s command invaded west tennessee , bent on securing recruits and supplies and disrupting the union occupation over the past three years , forrest a wealthy slave trader before the war had risen from private to major general and become the confederacy s most daring and feared cavalry officer now he set his sights on fort pillow although forrest and others later claimed that he sought to avenge wrongs inflicted by the fort s garrison on the local populace , his real motives were more mundane there is a federal force of 500 or 600 at fort pillow , forrest noted in early april , which i shall attend to in a day or two , as they have horses and supplies which we need the general gathered about 1 , 500 of his raiders and rode for pillow , reaching the unsuspecting fort at dawn on april 12 forrest s men approached the fort from several directions , dismounted , and quickly seized the high ground and outer defenses they set the contraband camp ablaze , sending women and children fleeing the garrison , meanwhile , retreated to the inner fort there , nearly perched on the edge of the bluff , major booth prepared his men for a lastditch defense the federals were in a difficult position booth commanded about 585 men and six cannons , but they faced enemy fire on three sides and had the steep bluff at their back rebels in the foliage and buildings surrounding the inner fort sent a constant shower of bullets into the men below , keeping them pinned down behind the walls worse still , the union artillerymen could not raise their guns muzzles high enough to target the enemy , and many of their shells failed to explode fort pillow s defenders , both black and white , fought manfully , a witness recalled i saw several negroes wounded , with blood running from their bodies , still engaged loading and firing cannon and muskets cheerfully the white tennesseans , no longer contemptuous of their black comrades , openly admired their bravery at 9 am , as he strode among his men , directing their fire and shouting encouragement , booth was killed by a bullet to the chest command then fell to maj william bradford of the 13th tennessee twice the rebels charged the fort and twice they were beaten back yet as the hours passed , confederate sharpshooters took a heavy toll one by one , the officers and soldiers in the fort fell dead or wounded at about 2 pm , forrest sent a flag of truce to the fort s commander with a message demanding surrender he promised to give the garrison fair treatment as prisoners of war should my demand be refused , forrest s note ended ominously , i cannot be responsible for the fate of your command it was an old forrest tactic convince the enemy to capitulate by threatening them with slaughter just weeks earlier , some of his troops had used a similar ultimatum to bluff a superior federal force into surrendering union city , tenn yet the men in fort pillow remained confident during the truce , black troops taunted their opponents from behind the walls , shouting if you want the fort , come and take it ! and come on , you dirty rebels ! the former slaves , southern unionists and confederate deserters who made up the fort s garrison were understandably reluctant to fall into rebel hands earlier in the war , confederate president jefferson davis had publicly promised to execute captured black troops and their officers , while the whites were likely to be branded as traitors and punished harshly bradford stalled for time , asking for one hour to consider forrest s demand but forrest was in no mood for quibbling and gave the garrison 20 minutes bradford and his officers resolved to continue resistance the major sent forrest a simple reply i will not surrender the final phase of the battle was brief and shocking as soon as 20 minutes passed , a confederate bugle sounded the charge and the rebels rushed the fort from three directions the defenders barely had time to respond before their assailants crowded the ditch , helped each other climb the walls , and seized the parapet the union troops their boldness gone broke and ran for the bluff , with bradford shouting , boys , save yourselves chaos ensued with few officers left alive to direct them , some defenders dropped their weapons in surrender , while others scrambled down the steep hillside but discipline also broke down among the rebels forrest s men had never faced black troops in battle before in the confederate mind , opposition from armed black men in this case , black men who had recently taunted them was tantamount to a slave insurrection , and few things were likelier to enrage a white southerner the sight of negro soldiers , a confederate witness said , stirred the bosoms of our soldiers with courageous madness nor was that all these black men were fighting alongside local white unionists , whom the rebels despised as homemade yankees and tennessee tories battle became massacre federals tried to surrender , but their attackers seemed determined to leave none alive the slaughter was awful , confederate sgt achilles v clark wrote words cannot describe the scene the poor deluded negroes would run up to our men fall upon their knees and with uplifted hands scream for mercy but they were ordered to their feet and then shot down the whitte sic men fared but little better their fort turned out to be a great slaughter pen a mass of frightened men , women and children fled to the river , hoping to swim for safety while some rebels lined the bluff to fire down into them , others pursued them to the water s edge a black private named george shaw had just reached the riverbank when a confederate stopped him please don t shoot me , shaw said the rebel replied , damn you , you are fighting against your master , raised his gun , and shot shaw in the mouth among the others , large numbers ran into the river , forrest reported , and were shot and drowned the river was dyed with the blood of the slaughtered for 200 yards the northern surgeon charles fitch had established a field hospital below the bluff now , the doctor watched helplessly as rebels hacked and shot at wounded men fitch then saw the confederates order about 20 surrendering federals into line before knocking them down with a volley confederates , their fury unabated , searched the riverbank whenever they found a union soldier hiding , they pulled him out and shot him indiscriminate slaughter , a confederate witness called the massacre , but it soon became more discriminating the attackers kept targeting black troops but began accepting the surrender of white unionists \( about 69 percent of white unionists survived , compared to 35 percent of colored troops \) thirty minutes had passed by the time forrest and his officers were able to restore discipline and halt the massacre several union witnesses , however , testified that rebels continued to hunt them throughout the night and into the next morning confederates , meanwhile , rifled their victims pockets , then looted the burning fort and village forrest had no intention of holding the fort on the morning of april 13 , he arranged a truce with union naval vessels in the river , agreeing to leave badly wounded federals behind for their navy to recover the confederates then gathered up their prisoners and plunder and rode for mississippi the black captives some of whom recognized forrest as the slave trader who had once sold them in memphis would be returned to slavery the white unionists were destined for prison camps major bradford , however , would not be among them confederates shot and killed him during the forced march , supposedly as he tried to escape all told , between 277 and 297 federals roughly half of the garrison had been killed or mortally wounded an additional 61 men survived with wounds only a few dozen soldiers and civilians managed to elude death or capture by any objective standard , the stunning casualty figures , the small number of black survivors and the accounts of witnesses indicate that forrest s men committed a massacre but the fallout from the incident in the coming weeks and months would demonstrate that objectivity , north and south , was in short supply historians and biographers have long argued over the extent of forrest s culpability in the atrocities it is clear , however , that forrest himself and many other confederates initially hailed the massacre as a propaganda victory it is hoped , the general proclaimed in his postbattle report , that these facts will demonstrate to the northern people that negro soldiers cannot cope with southerners fort pillow was , in fact , just one of several massacres that confederates committed against black soldiers that year but forrest was a far better general than a prophet as union troops reclaimed the ruined fort on april 14 and tended to the dead and wounded , their eyewitness reports rippled outward , whipping soldiers and civilians into outrage there is a great deal of excitement in town in consequence of this affair , especially among our colored troops , a union general reported from memphis if this is to be the game of the enemy they will soon learn that it is one at which two can play the union adopted no official policy of retaliation , but black troops frequently went into battle shouting remember fort pillow ! and showed their enemies little mercy rather than cowing black soldiers and the northern public , the actions of forrest s men had only hardened their resolve one hundred fifty years later , relatively few physical traces remain of the fort complex or the horror that happened there on april 12 , 1864 the site survives as a state park , but tall trees threaten to overwhelm it the mississippi , moreover , has shifted two miles west of the bluff where fort pillow once overlooked it nature has assisted forrest s apologists in their efforts to obliterate the truth nevertheless , as the place where massacre sparked

kohima , india soldiers died by the dozens , by the hundreds and then by the thousands in a battle here 70 years ago two bloody weeks of fighting came down to just a few yards across an asphalt tennis court night after night , japanese troops charged across the court s white lines , only to be killed by almost continuous firing from british and indian machine guns the battle of kohima and imphal was the bloodiest of world war ii in india , and it cost japan much of its best army in burma but the battle has been largely forgotten in india as an emblem of the country s colonial past the indian troops who fought and died here were subjects of the british empire in this remote , northeastern corner of india , more recent battles with a mix of local insurgencies among tribal groups that have long sought autonomy have made remembrances of former glories a luxury now , as india loosens its security grip on this region and a fragile peace blossoms among the many combatants here , historians are hoping that this year s anniversary reminds the world of one of the most extraordinary fights of the second world war the battle was as the winner of a contest by britain s , beating out waterloo and dday as britain s greatest battle , though it was overshadowed at the time by the normandy landings the japanese regard the battle of imphal to be their greatest defeat ever , said robert lyman , author of japan s last bid for victory the invasion of india 1944 and it gave indian soldiers a belief in their own martial ability and showed that they could fight as well or better than anyone else the battlefields in what are now the indian states of nagaland and manipur some just a few miles from the border with myanmar , which was then burma are also well preserved because of the region s longtime isolation trenches , bunkers and airfields remain as they were left 70 years ago worn by time and monsoons but clearly visible in the jungle this mountain city also boasts a graceful , terraced military cemetery on which the lines of the old tennis court are demarcated in white stone a closing ceremony for a threemonth commemoration is planned for june 28 in imphal , and representatives from the united states , australia , japan , india and other nations have promised to attend the battle of imphal and kohima is not forgotten by the japanese , said yasuhisa kawamura , deputy chief of mission at the japanese embassy in new delhi , who is planning to attend the ceremony military historians refer to it as one of the fiercest battles in world history a small but growing tour industry has sprung up around the battlefields over the past year , led by a hemant katoch , a local history buff but whether india will ever truly celebrate the battle of kohima and imphal is unclear india s founding fathers were divided on whether to support the british during world war ii , and india s governments have generally had uneasy relationships even with the nation s own military so far , only local officials and a former top indian general have agreed to participate in this week s closing ceremony india has fought six wars since independence , and we do n't have a memorial for a single one , said mohan guruswamy , a fellow at the , a public policy organization in india and at imphal , indian troops died , but they were fighting for a colonial government rana t s chhina , secretary of the in new delhi , said that top indian officials were participating this year in some of the 100year commemorations of crucial battles of world war i i suppose we may need to let imphal and kohima simmer for a few more decades before we embrace it fully , he said but there s hope the battle began some two years after japanese forces in burma in 1942 , which brought the japanese army to india s eastern border lt gen renya mutaguchi persuaded his japanese superiors to allow him to attack british forces at imphal and kohima in hopes of preventing a british counterattack but general mutaguchi planned to push farther into india to destabilize the british raj , which by then was already being convulsed by the independence movement led by mahatma gandhi general mutaguchi brought a large number of indian troops captured after the fall of malaya and singapore who agreed to join the japanese in hopes of creating an independent india the british were led by lt gen william slim , a brilliant tactician who reformed and retrained the eastern army after its crushing defeat in burma the british and indian forces were supported by planes commanded by the united states army gen joseph w stilwell once the allies became certain that the japanese planned to attack , general slim withdrew his forces from western burma and had them dig defensive positions in the hills around imphal valley , hoping to draw the japanese into a battle far from their supply lines but none of the british commanders believed that the japanese could cross the nearly impenetrable jungles around kohima in force , so when a full division of nearly 15 , 000 japanese troops came swarming out of the vegetation on april 4 , the town was only lightly defended by some 1 , 500 british and indian troops the meant that those troops were largely cut off from reinforcements and supplies , and a bitter battle eventually led the british and indians to withdraw into a small enclosure next to a tennis court the japanese , without air support or supplies , eventually became exhausted , and the allied forces soon of kohima and the hills around imphal on june 22 , british and indian forces finally cleared the last of the japanese from the crucial road linking imphal and kohima , ending the siege the japanese 15th army , 85 , 000 strong for the invasion of india , was essentially destroyed , with dead and missing injuries and illnesses took many of the rest there were 16 , 500 british casualties ningthoukhangjam moirangningthou , 83 , still lives in a house at the foot of a hill that became the site of one of the fiercest battles near imphal mr ningthoukhangjam watched as three british tanks slowly destroyed every bunker constructed by the japanese we called them iron elephants , ' he said of the tanks we 'd never seen anything like that before andrew s arthur was away at a christian high school when the battle started by the time he made his way home to the village of shangshak , where one of the first battles was fought , it had been destroyed and his family was living in the jungle , he said he recalled encountering a wounded japanese soldier who could barely stand mr arthur said he took the soldier to the british , who treated him most of my life , nobody ever spoke about the war , he said it s good that people are finally talking about it again
san francisco i heard about the new building for months before i saw it part of a leading medical center , its green architecture and design were getting a lot of attention , as was its integration of topnotch modern medicine with health and wellness spaces inspired by cultures from around the world my father s doctor had moved there , and driving to his appointment we looked forward to experiencing the cuttingedge new building firsthand outside , i unloaded the walker and led my 82yearold father through the sliding glass doors inside , there was a single bench made of recycled materials i noticed it did n't have the arm supports that a frail elderly person requires to safely sit down and get back up it was a long trek to the right clinic and i was doubleparked outside helping my father onto the bench , i said , wait here , and hoped he would remember to do so long enough for me to park and return he nodded we were used to this it happened almost everywhere we went at restaurants , the bank , the airport , department stores many of these places our historic city hall , with its wide steps and renovated dome , the futuristic movie theater and the new clinic were gorgeous the problem was that not one of them was set up to facilitate access by someone like my father that may have been intentional a few years earlier , i 'd heard about a new community center where the older adult program was positioned so attendees entered via a nondescript side entrance in order not to scare off the younger people the center hoped to attract such approaches once may have made sense from a business perspective , but current demographic realities are creating financial and practical reasons to build more homes , businesses , health care facilities and public buildings that are well suited to older people s needs the americans with disabilities act s guidelines help , but they do not ensure access or safety for this unique and rapidly growing population many buildings are adacompliant and still difficult to navigate for older adults who have one or more physical , sensory or cognitive challenges , and especially for the frail elderly who have many to some , this may sound like a small issue it s not over 40 million americans are 65 or older , and 11 million the fastest growing segment of the older population are over age 80 too often , current buildings turn impairments a bum leg , lessthanperfect hearing , the inability to walk long distances into handicaps ironically , this includes not just restaurants , multilevel houses and large businesses , but most health care structures i hear about this regularly in my role as a doctor who makes house calls while patients often end up in our care at home practice because they can no longer leave their homes , not infrequently the problem is at the other end the hospital or clinic is too hard to navigate still , it was n't until i left my father at the muchlauded new green clinic that it occurred to me that the challenges that he and my patients faced navigating medical facilities were symptomatic of a larger societal problem just as green architecture and design came into being in response to the energy crisis of the late 1970s , we in the 21st century have to start creatively building to meet the challenges of our aging population we need silver architecture and design what would a silver building look like \? for starters , it would be welllit , and offer easy , safe access that does n't require pulling open heavy doors or remembering a key building materials would minimize noise , overstimulation , distraction and the risk of falls doors , rooms and public areas would accommodate walkers , wheelchairs and a person walking arm in arm with a caregiver there would be sturdy , regularly spaced chairs where people could rest and regroup none of this is novel these and other strategies are already in use in many longterm care facilities and in specialized areas of hospitals , such as geriatric emergency departments or acute care of the elderly units but they are n't nearly as prevalent as they should be diana c anderson , a resident physician at columbia university medical center who is also a licensed architect \( she calls herself a dochitect \) , says that despite the growing health care specialization in architecture , many spaces in health facilities are ill suited for their actual use health care might be the ideal sector to start developing design prototypes that could be applied to homes and even neighborhoods , so people can stay active and grow older without having to move to retirement homes over the next few years , we should begin to see prizes for excellence in silver design , just as there are awards for green buildings when local communities review plans for new or improved buildings , they should start by asking questions not only about job creation and traffic flow , and , for green buildings , about sustainability and energy use , but also about how well the design meets the needs of residents and consumers of all ages in health care , leaders should examine the considerable data on how facilities harm and hinder older patients , and move forward only with buildings that prioritize equal access , health and safety some might say that buildings ca n't cater to every group with special needs but silver architecture and design are n't about indulging a special interest group they 're about maximizing quality of life and independence for a life stage most of us will reach green architecture is good for the environment silver architecture is good for humans the best new buildings will be both
tijuana , mexico in tijuana the other day , i met a waitress named mari mari had left her home in acapulco to cross illegally into the united states in 1999 , but was deported three years ago to tijuana it had been a long time since she had seen her mother , so she went home to visit but down in acapulco , wages were low , work was scarce and violence was widespread then men raped her on a beach one night mari fled back to tijuana her waitress job , with tips , she told me , allows her to earn far more than she could scrape together in acapulco , or in a monterrey factory , where she worked for a time and , after several years of savage drug violence , there s peace in tijuana now this is my land of opportunity , she said there s more work here and it pays better one reason i love tijuana is that you can have this kind of conversation here tijuana is not pretty a city of 13 million people , it is chaotic , grimy , unplanned , loud , and it smells bad it possesses none of the colonial architecture or history of morelia , oaxaca city or zacatecas , across mexico s interior on the contrary , most of its neighborhoods , stacked across alarmingly steep hills , are less than 40 years old but tijuana s beauty lies deeper , and has to do with why the town is flourishing now only a few decades ago , tijuana was a blank slate , a small coastal outpost on the california border it had none of the old elites , family business groups bent on preserving their power and wealth instead , it was folks beaten down by mexico who came by the millions to , and often through , tijuana desperate and possessing only their own wits and capacity for work , they brought a dynamism that mexico had stifled but tijuana found use for those who stayed found a new world and many moved up into the middle class in a lifetime it helped that tijuana is the mexican city farthest from mexico city tijuana tolerated far less of the desiccated pomp and protocol , the reverence for title , that has suffocated so many fine ideas and sharp minds in the capital , which is the center of the country in almost every way , good and bad to be far from mexico city , particularly to the north , was once considered to be virtually not mexican at all federal bureaucrats from mexico city for years only unwillingly left the center of power they were paid extra to go to tijuana but that distance gave tijuana oxygen there s an old saying about mexico so far from god , so close to the united states there s some truth to that but the last few decades have shown that , for poor mexicans , the truer riff is , farther from mexico city , closer to god immigrants , fleeing north for decades , have demonstrated that so has tijuana , which has been mexico s best domestic factory at turning the poor into the middle class crucially , of course , the city is faceplanted up against the united states early in the town s history , in fact , it was easier to get to tijuana from san diego than from elsewhere in mexico , where the winding road from mexicali took most cars a week until several decades ago , tijuana used dollars , not pesos ties to the southern california economy created so many new chances that a poor , ambitious guy could n't help but find something new to do with his life in tijuana , risktaking usually paid off among the first to learn that were the yeseros the plasterstatue makers they learned to shape plaster into everything from bulls to mickey mouse , and created an industry selling them to tourists the misbehavior of drunk and horny americans was also an opportunity for someone looking for an angle , and many grabbed it but tijuana drew more from the united states than the dollars of debauched american tourists tijuanans had the graciousness to overlook tourists' behavior as they peered north and glimpsed a different way of doing almost everything art , business , government , education today , the city has a deeper tradition of private giving than most in mexico , where the central government discouraged philanthropy , seeing it as competition to its own power listening to san diego public broadcasting , and drawing from the example of nonprofit arts groups there , tijuana s middle classes have created one of mexico s most vibrant opera scenes they did this with very little government assistance a rarity among mexican arts groups their opera in the street festival attracts close to 10 , 000 people every july it takes place a few blocks from the wall between the two countries in colonia libertad , a vast neighborhood where the city s human smuggling industry first took root and many houses have that saggingweddingcake look tijuana does have a brutal , cynical side rural folks fled their destitute villages in mexico s interior but in tijuana , they were quickly mashed into an industrial work force , living in shantytowns without basic services such as sewers or drinking water , and doing tedious productionline work assembling goods for american consumers in addition , mexico s corrupt political culture and american tourists' taste for the forbidden allowed a sinister underworld to develop , trafficking people and substances to gringos for a while , this side of tijuana strangled the city by 2007 , the reigning arellano f lix family s drug cartel was disintegrating , and a fight for control ensued bodies piled up evil men emerged one s nickname was el muletas crutches because he left people crippled another cartel member was known as el pozolero the soupmaker his job was to dissolve the corpses of rivals in a chemical soup he admitted to liquefying some 300 bodies when he was captured in 2009 tijuana was paralyzed by curfews , kidnappings of doctors and dentists , and reports of mass slaughters american tourists ceased coming many in the middle class fled but the medieval bloodshed receded in 2010 , and since then the town s open and effervescent essence has revived most shops selling velvet paintings and nakedlady playing cards died after the americans stopped coming but the tourist drag , avenida revoluci n , is now repopulating with daring restaurants , microbreweries , boutiques and art galleries they are owned by hipsters using the strip s now cheap rents , and the confident risktaking culture that tijuana handed down to them , to cater to the local market of middleclass young people just like them ecosystems of hightech startups and avantgarde artists are emerging so , too , is a new generation of filmmakers , using canon 60ds to mine the documentary raw material the city offers decades after rising from the coastal desert , tijuana finally has something like a history more important , it has emerged from its darkest days to return to its roots as that rare place within mexico where poor people like mari can find refuge and a future
i clipped a question that was at the end of the post and brought it to the top if we can t get it right with tobacco , where there s no benefit to weigh against the toll in lives and costs , how can we get it right with fossil fuels , where the realtime benefits of affordable energy seem always to trump the longterm risks from climate change \? of the carnegie institution replied first how many of us are addicted to eating too much food , even though we know that it is bad for us in the long term \? many of us have minor addictions such as this that we can t get right , where we know that we are sacrificing our own longterm wellbeing for a little instant gratification yes , it is hard to break bad habits that are deeply ingrained it being hard does not make it any less important when our bad habits harm others , breaking it is not only difficult but also a moral responsibility i replied this way , including a reference to a reader s comment but the moral responsibility argument ends up murky again because of the balance in weighing current societal energy needs \( cheap energy food , comfort , health , etc \) against longterm greenhouse hazards this comment on the post is relevant doug allen , inman , sc , sorry andy not even close smoking has no redeeming qualities cheap energy is what the third world needs to build infrastructure \( like electricity \) and escape poverty , thereby securing better health and education \( especially for women \) , and a modicum of affluence which , as always , will bring down birth rates , and allow those long suffering peoples to become a caring and sharing part of the world community whose concerns will no longer be the just tomorrow s meal , but also the environmental and ecological health of our planet read how the left came to reject cheap energy for the poorthe great progressive reversal at breakthrough institute caldeira  you think it is ok for us to recreate a cretaceouslike climate on earth , just so we can all be a few percent richer \? that is the argument you are making economists estimate it will only take a few per cent of gdp to transform our energy system into one that does not use the sky as a waste dump if we already had a carbon neutral energy system , would you argue that it is ok to melt the ice caps , shift weather patterns , acidify the oceans , etc , so we could be a few per cent richer \? i think not there are enough resources on this planet to allow everyone to live a good and healthy life without making large and irreversible changes to earth s climate if you are concerned about the poorest on this planet , then work so that the richest help the poorest \( recall that the 85 richest people have the same wealth as the bottom 385 billion \) we do not have to create a cretaceous climate so that people can live well i think it is all about moral responsibility of current generations not to forclose options on future generations revkin  i m not saying this is okay , mind you just that it s inevitable that the societal bias will tilt toward the near and now as long as there s a deep demand for the services energy provides given the slinky nature of human development , with the majority of the planet s citizens still stuck at the far end of the spring as we sit in comfort in heat or snow \( my situation today \) , i d love it if you could identify a realworld path past that ethical bind i d love to see poor and fastdeveloping countries leapfrog , slinkystyle , past our fossilbinge solution to progress but without cheap energy choices , i don t see this happening any time soon combine that with shifting baselines of perception of environmental risks and you do indeed have a \( long \) path toward a cretaceous climate hopefully long enough that there can be a heap of ingenuity and enlightenment along the way this is why i ve shifted lately to focusing on developing traits and capacities in society \( connectedness , ingenuity , etc \) rather than goals measured in gigatons or degrees i need to write a lot more on that front of princeton university weighed in on the difference between personal behavior and societal choices extrapolating from individual behavior to group \( or government \) decisions \( or policy \) is a very weak argument for lots of reasons the tobacco analogy works in regard to the fossil fuel tobacco industry positions but that s about it of stanford law school dug in on the economics let me start by saying that i believe deeply that the only way that china , india , and other developing countries are going to choose different development paths that avoid ken s cretaceous earth scenario is if the us leads by example do as i say , not as i do is not going to cut it it follows that how our energy policies impact energy choices at home is of crucial importance perhaps more than how they impact choices abroad so i begin with impacts at home of energy exports right now , one of the biggest threats to continued us emissions reductions are the relatively closed export markets for oil and gas these are leading to falling prices both for natural gas and crude which in turn is leading to very difficult competitive conditions for renewables , nuclear , as well as significant reductions in cost and consequent growth in emissions for energy intensive industries \( trevor houser s recent study on oil and gas makes this point nicely \) so i think opening our markets via allowing exports is an important step that will help set the conditions for continued gradual movement towards a cleaner energy economy the reality of course is that increased exports would have marginal impacts on the rest of the world s use of energy it s very difficult to see a future in which the us is the marginal supply in global oil markets us coal exports , if they scale , will more likely than not displace coal with different price , heat , and pollution attributes in asian markets significant exports of us liquefied natural gas could do two things first , they would help to slow a shift back to coal in europe and japan second , they would help to stanch industry resistance in europe to climate and renewables policy of course , in the long run , all of the above just leads to lower energy prices which leads to greater consumption of fossil fuels we need to price the thing we don t want carbon if we are to have any hope of avoiding a return to the cretaceous opening up closed markets can help in this , but they are at best a stopgap measure caldeira  i agree 100 with michael wara s lead by example we need to do the right thing regardless of what others are doing we cannot expect others to do the right thing if we are not doing the right thing ourselves of tufts university closed things out with this reflection there is a lot to the point that the us needs to take a leadership role for developing countries to agree to a low carbon path i have a doctoral student diplomat who has been at this a long time , and that is his conclusion after many years in the negotiation trenches that the us must lead for the rest of the world to follow a low carbon trajectory so what about our exporting our fossil fuels in order to improve the lives of the poor in other countries \? this framing overlooks the fact that the big power grid central power generation model is not going to happen in the vast majority of developing countries in fact the only way that most people in subsaharan africa outside of south africa are obtaining electrical services is through smallscale solar energy a similar shift is taking place in rural bangladesh and in pakistan too many governments are too incompetent and corrupt to keep the lights on china is a rare country that has been able to shift rapidly and successfully to our central power grid model there are lots of innovative renewable energy projects in developing countries , and it is now a goal of the un and world bank working together on sustainable energy for all  also , the world bank and us aid plus the nordic countries are no longer financing coal plants abroad , and none do nuclear power either the only largescale projects are hydro dams that the world bank is getting back into i am not na ve enough to think that slogans can work , but i know that the majority of the world s poor will not live long enough to get the supposed benefits of us exported coal i can assure you that china will be beating us to the punch with exports of renewable energy that is scaling faster than any other new power source in the world right now figuring how to provide energy services with the least amount of low carbon primary energy is a viable strategy for us and for developing countries instead we spend our time debating how much coal and other fossil fuels we need next year to meet our needs we do not need 500 exajoules of primary energy to run the world , and do not even need half of the end use energy that we use to perform the tasks the ipcc renewable energy report discusses this to some extent , and there are many additional places it is discussed as well as for the morality of exporting coal and pet coke , i find it very troubling according to the lancet 2010 report , coal alone kills 35 million people alone just from the air pollution in china the estimate is 12 million and in india it is 06 million so this is just like exporting tobacco to the poor , except it not only kills them in the medium term , it condemns them to misery forever even with discounting that is troublesome actually , i am becoming optimistic about raising the price of fossil fuels with some sort of carbon tax some conservative think tanks are beginning to argue for a carbon tax in exchange for a cut in the corporate and personal income tax who knows \?
dublin in the west of , they say that if you can see the mountain , it s going to rain and if you ca n't see the mountain \? it s raining ireland may have its troubles , but drought is n't one of them which may be why proposed charges for household water have brought tens of thousands into the streets in protests that have deeply unnerved the political order if the irish are finally catching the mood of antiausterity anger that has been rolling across much of the european union , it may be a case not so much of the straw that broke the camel s back as the drop that caused the dam to burst until very recently , the irish were the eurozone s champion masochists since the banking crash of 2008 , they have borne big tax increases , severe cuts in public services , mass unemployment and the largescale emigration of their children a found that ireland was in the undesirable position of owning the costliest banking crisis in advanced economies since at least and it was still ongoing , imposing a huge public debt and dire fiscal costs on irish citizens all of this has happened with a great deal of private grumbling but only sporadic public protest in a general election in 2011 , the centerright party blamed for the collapse was kicked out and replaced by a coalition led by another , almost identical , centerright party the new government accepted and implemented the same conditions of stark austerity that had been imposed on the old one by the imf and the european union if you were looking at ireland from european union headquarters in brussels or from the european central bank s offices in frankfurt , this made the country an island of comfort in a sea of political turbulence the european establishment is under siege from both left and right greece has its leftwing opposition party , syriza , within striking distance of taking power in next year s elections spain s populist protest movement podemos has gathered impressive pace france s postfascist national front is polling strongly even in britain , the rightwing antieuropean uk independence party is causing panic among the traditional ruling parties ireland s apparent passivity suggested that these storms might blow over , that familiar political landscapes could survive europe s long , deep recession the irish story looked , after all , like a tale of patience rewarded the bailout program , which gave the imf and european union effective control over the irish government s fiscal policies , was left behind having stoically taken its medicine , the irish economy seems to be in a fragile but real recovery by between 4 and 5 percent this year and by at least 3 percent in 2015 from over 15 percent of the work force to 11 percent for the first time since 2008 , the irish government was able this autumn to bring in a largely neutral budget , without broad tax increases or spending cuts dublin s streets are full of christmas shoppers its property market is almost as buoyant , with rapidly rising house prices easing some of the pain of the vast mortgages inherited from the years of the celtic tiger bubble so why are the irish , who have taken years of punishment , suddenly in such a rage \? it s not just outsiders who are asking this question the government fully expected to be acclaimed for having steered the country safely through a historic crisis and to be wafted all the way to reelection in 2016 on the acclamations of the citizenry instead , that the three parties that have dominated the state throughout its history have the support of less than half of potential voters sinn fein , the populist and nationalist party that has traditionally been far weaker in the republic of ireland than across the border in northern ireland , has gained significant ground , as have farleft groups but the most popular political option in recent polls is , essentially , none of the above almost a third of the electorate says it will vote for nonparty or microparty candidates this is a rare case of change actually falling from the sky the catalyst for this transformation is plain old water in a recent , 33 percent of people said they would refuse to pay the charges for domestic water when they become due in the spring \( and less than half of those polled said they intended to pay \) this is in spite of the government s having already made huge concessions in the face of an earlier wave of protests by reducing the average effective charge \( about 200 \) a year per household , making irish domestic water the cheapest in europe compared with many of the other tax increases endured over six years , this seems too small a measure to have such large consequences as , indeed , it is the current irish political ferment is really a case of add water and stir vigorously to get a whole mess of trouble all the ingredients for mass dissatisfaction were already present they just needed something to bring them together there is a deep sense of injustice at being turned into one of the most indebted nations on earth in order to rescue international bondholders who gambled on rogue irish banks there is the way the pain has been inflicted most deeply on the poorest people the last four government budgets have been regressive , hitting those on the lowest incomes hardest there is the bitterness of yet again having to export the country s greatest asset its talented , highly educated young people above all , there s the gap between the irish story and the irish experience the story is upbeat austerity works the experience is rather different the impressive gdp figures are at least partly unreal , boosted by the accounting practices of irishbased multinationals unemployment remains very high , and the figures would be much worse if people were not emigrating household debt in ireland is still the second highest in europe relative to disposable incomes , which have not improved while ireland s fearful sovereign debt has stabilized , it remains very high these miseries actually feel a lot worse when everyone is telling you that happy days are here again perhaps , in the end , there s a religious aspect to it all the irish largely accepted austerity because they believed they had sinned and deserved to be punished but the converse was that , having been good for so long , they should be rewarded they did n't expect heaven to be a place where it rains all the time and the angels charge you for a drink of water
in 2012 , leon tolksdorf arrived in storrs , conn , from germany , unsure of how to interact with some of his teammates he knew his fellow berliner niels giffey and had played on a club team with the brother of another german player on the roster , enosch wolf , but relating to his peers from brooklyn or chicago was a new experience during the final timeout of sunday s east regional final , after giffey had made the first of two free throws to give connecticut a 5951 lead with six seconds remaining , ryan boatright , a 6foot guard from aurora , ill , sought out the 68 tolksdorf and jumped into his arms to celebrate the huskies have affectionately given tolksdorf the nickname schnitzel , a meal he has served for his jamaican and african teammates , who in return have treated him to dishes of plantains and yams the bond that has carried connecticut \( 308 \) to the final four this season was formed when the program reached a nadir when kevin ollie was hired at connecticut to succeed the hall of fame coach jim calhoun in september 2012 , the huskies had been barred from postseason play for that season because of poor academic performance three players had left the program in the aftermath two weeks after he took the job , ollie brought in dr joe carr , a sports psychologist , to meet with the team over the course of one weekend , the huskies spent about 30 hours working with carr , sometimes in sessions that lasted eight to nine consecutive hours , according to boatright initially , connecticut s players were skeptical of what was perceived as another formulaic team chemistry exercise boatright said that none of the huskies wanted to attend the sessions or even talk at first , but that now carr is a part of this team , and after we had that meeting , our chemistry was unbelievable we went from all being friends to becoming family , the sophomore phillip nolan said since 1999 , carr has spoken to about 40 college teams , as well as nba players like lebron james and carmelo anthony carr was suggested to ollie by the massachusetts assistant shyrone chatman umass coach derek kellogg , who had previously worked with carr , said his reputation among professional athletes gave him street credibility among younger players he s kind of cool he has the lingo and talk , kellogg said and the credentials he has opens the eyes and ears immediately north texas coach tony benford first met carr when he was an assistant at marquette , during its runs to the round of 16 in 2011 and 2012 he 'll start with probably your toughest kids or one of the kids everyone really respects , benford said you see one of those guys open up everyone else kind of falls in line everyone has a story they want to tell during connecticut s sessions with carr , the german players heard teammates recount seeing friends killed they realized the pressure to succeed put on american high school stars , sometimes as a result of the players' socioeconomic background some of my teammates , they 've experienced a lot of tough hits during their childhood , tolksdorf said sometimes you might say something to hurt them you wo n't even realize tolksdorf continued it s hard to describe what basketball means to them to support their families at one point that s pretty different to what we 're used to in germany that s a good thing to know during the 201112 season , connecticut guard shabazz napier was coping with the death of a friend from his hometown , roxbury , mass a sophomore at the time , he did not know how to channel his emotions with his teammates , which led to tension we knew each other pretty well , but that meeting just broke a lot of people down it made people open up , boatright said you just got to see , like , the inside to our teammates' lives and see why they act the way they act sometimes carr said one of his first steps was to redefine chemistry to napier and the huskies he used the acronym rare to represent four concepts relationships , accepting challenges , recovering from mistakes , and executing coaches' directions shabazz in particular , he was an isolator , carr said coach ollie s patience made it easy for 'bazz to thaw out ollie said carr s work helped napier s maturation over the past two years he has an amazing gift his personality is dynamic , ollie said of napier he s a true leader , and people follow him earlier in his career , he was not trusting , and shying away from that he s also vulnerable now before he was n't able to show his weaknesses and own up kentan facey , a freshman forward from jamaica , said the team had joined together to help its international players overcome language barriers a brotherhood does n't really defer based on ethnicity , or whatever you may call it , nationality , he said as long as you understand that there s a brotherhood and it s stronger than anything you encounter in your life , then that s going to help you overcome anything that comes up one of carr s basic lessons is getting players to critically judge one another s daily performance after connecticut s victory over michigan state in the east region final , ollie talked about his team s level 5 championship mentality , which is one of carr s main teaching points benford said his point guard chris jones is rated on a scale from 1 to 5 each day by his teammates , to gauge how vocal he was during practice john t reilly , the coach at gannon , has players rate the energy level of their practices on the same scale , and he keeps the results in a book to monitor their progression the opportunities are endless , ollie said of the mantra you can take a roof off a team now we 're trying to go to a level 6 ollie had previously worked as an assistant for calhoun , but he inherited a team that had lost two of its top players to the nba , andre drummond and jeremy lamb in search of leadership , players said that carr s visit made them all accountable carr periodically checks in with the team during the season and is available to talk with the players over the phone throughout the year this season , carr met with the huskies before a pivotal lateseason home game against 11thranked cincinnati the unranked huskies defeated the bearcats , 5145 , a win that players said spurred their run to the final four on wednesday , carr met with the team as it prepared for saturday s semifinal against topseeded florida i think dr carr steps in at an opportune time to make sure that the team could capitalize on the fact that we 're a really good team , and we could make it far in this ncaa tournament , facey said having him come in and bringing us closer together in a sense helped us to be where we are today
philadelphia jordan matthews was drafted in may by the , who were eager to add him to their stable of dynamic offensive talent those first few days , matthews met lesean mccoy and darren sproles , jeremy maclin and zach ertz , but none of them had quite the effect on him that the team s backup quarterback did it was a welcometothenfl moment , said matthews , a wide receiver out of vanderbilt because it was like , yo , it s that guy' that guy , , represents different things to different people , and matthews chooses to remember him as the quarterback who began his career by guiding to two afc championship games call it a hunch , but far more people probably view sanchez as the guy whose head collided with an offensive lineman s posterior , that was returned for a new england touchdown on thanksgiving night in 2012 the third act of sanchez s football life began sunday , when he replaced the injured nick foles and played the final three quarters of the eagles' 3121 victory at houston , firing two touchdown passes at the same stadium where he made his debut with the jets five years ago sanchez s current coach , chip kelly , insists on having two quarterbacks of starting caliber , cognizant of how promising seasons can disintegrate without capable backups after michael vick was hurt last season , the eagles might not have gone on to win the nfc east without foles , and now they are in a similar situation with foles , who cracked his clavicle , expected to miss at least the next six weeks , sanchez has taken over a 62 team with super bowl aspirations he will start monday night , against carolina , for the first time in more than 22 months i did n't want it to happen under these circumstances , said sanchez , who knows about unfortunate circumstances he appeared to be leading the jets' quarterback competition in august 2013 when coach rex ryan decided to insert him in the fourth quarter of a preseason game against the giants , behind the secondteam offensive line , leading to a hit that tore the labrum in his right shoulder sanchez was infuriated , but he never griped in public seven months later , the jets released him , which was the best and , really , only move for both parties to revive his career , sanchez headed 90 miles south to play for one of football s most innovative coaches in an uptempo offensive scheme that can maximize his strengths just get the next play and go , sanchez said it feels like a fast break in basketball you 're the point guard , and just dish it to the open guy do n't hang on to it too long , and try not to get hit the eagles' offensive coordinator , pat shurmur , called the team s system quarterbackfriendly as long as the quarterback makes good decisions a quarterback s two other most important attributes , shurmur said , are his timing and his accuracy , and sanchez has shown the eagles that he has both we do n't bog them down with a lot of silly things , shurmur said , so the ball can come out quicker kelly eased sanchez in by calling a play that sent maclin on a deep post route on his first snap sanchez connected with maclin for 52 yards , and later that drive , he found matthews for an 11yard touchdown sanchez finished 15of22 passing for 202 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions , one of which bounced off the hands of josh huff from the outside looking in , people would say he did n't have the weapons he might have here , ertz , a tight end , said of sanchez s time with the jets i mean , we do have a lot of weapons the jets' lack of them stunted sanchez s development and contributed to his miserable performance across the 2011 and 2012 seasons 52 turnovers and 12 losses in his final 18 starts instead of serving as a caretaker , as the jets more or less asked of him , sanchez is being counted on to win the game shurmur said that the eagles' plan did not change when sanchez entered the game on sunday and that aside from adding a few elements that sanchez prefers designed rollouts , perhaps their plan for carolina would be the same as it would have been with foles he s the kind of guy that will move the referee out of the way to get the ball snapped , offensive lineman evan mathis said he takes the tempo seriously he s a fast thinker , and he can get that done about the same time wednesday that sanchez ran out to practice as the starting quarterback of a firstplace team , a plane flew over the jets' practice fields in florham park , nj , with a banner reading , fire john idzik with the jets 18 and their quarterback situation a mess , it is revisionist history to suggest that they should have kept sanchez he is in a better place now , and he knows it i 'd like to think i 've grown , and i know i have , sanchez said just watching film , things come faster it comes easier you hear a lot of people say the game slows down i think you just tend to speed up , you tend to relax a little bit , and i really enjoy playing in this system , so i think it helps me sanchez turns 28 on tuesday , an age when quarterbacks are considered in the prime of their careers he chooses not to view this opportunity as a rebirth sorry to ruin that one for you , he said or to let his past define him i could go tease mark right now about the butt fumble , and he 'll laugh about it , maclin said sanchez had that goodnatured personality when he played for the jets , too but now that he plays for an offensiveminded coach , on a thriving team and for an organization that he adores , only one thing links the two experiences sanchez , as he hoped he would be , is a starter in the nfl again now i'm hopefully a better version of myself , sanchez said , and the best version of myself for this monday night game
\( front page , nov 16 \) is another reminder that prospective college students and their families would do well to slow down and catch their breath there are nearly 3 , 000 fouryear colleges in the united states , and the average admit rate at those colleges is nearly 65 percent rather than obsessing about a school s ranking and applying only to the most selective colleges , students should try to find the school that s the best fit for them more selective does n't mean better it just means more selective there really is a college for every applicant , and students tend to enroll at the school where they belong as application deadlines near , the most important question parents can ask their high school seniors is how can i help you love this last year of high school \? and after asking the question , parents should really listen the answer is likely to involve lowering the flame debra shaver dean of admission , smith college northampton , mass , nov 17 , 2014 in your article a spokeswoman for naviance , an online tool used by high school students to keep track of applications , said the record for college applications was 86 while that is clearly excessive , it is true that applying to 10 or fewer schools can be risky my own daughter is a case in point she told me that to have a choice of four or five schools , she should apply to at least 20 counselors , teachers and friends thought that was ridiculous the schools were a mixture of selective , state and supposed safeties she was waitlisted at 10 , rejected at 5 and accepted at 6 all good except that she was waitlisted or rejected at a number of her safeties , even though she was clearly qualified the school to which she applied at the 11th hour , her addon , is the school she attends , stanford no one could have predicted this waitlisted at half \? rejected at less competitive schools , accepted at more elite \? there was no rhyme or reason to it with so many qualified applicants , and colleges obsessed with us news world report rankings , applying to college has become a stressful process that is expensive and timeconsuming something needs to be done it s not fair to the students , their parents or the college admission officers last year , ucla had more than 100 , 000 applicants and accepted only 18 percent ! it might as well be a lottery lisa bernard los altos , calif , nov 16 , 2014 when alexa verola , featured in your article , and others apply to dozens of colleges , they are engaging in behavior that in economics would be characterized as a negative externality an action that , for the pool of high school seniors as a whole , has only deleterious effects in the end , ms verola can go to only one school , yet she will command perhaps six or eight acceptances , especially from schools for which she is perhaps overqualified other students must rationally react to ms verola by acting similarly , on down the applicant food chain yet ms verola herself suffers when applicants more qualified than she hog multiple acceptances at her dream schools as the number of applicants soars , colleges have to constantly recalculate what percentage of those they accept will actually attend , leading to distortions and inefficiencies because of their increasingly incomplete knowledge between the pressure to get good grades and even a normal number of applications , the first semester of senior year is hard enough because there are not enough hours in the day , students become specialists in cutting corners so the final result of overapplying is a plethora of mediocre schoolwork marc kagan new york , nov 16 , 2014 i write as the parent of three children one just graduated from college two are college juniors none applied to more than 10 schools , and i thought that even 10 was too many unmentioned in this article is the most important downside to sending in so many applications students end up getting admitted to numerous schools they have no interest in attending , blocking acceptance for students who want to attend those schools all high schools should limit the number of applications \( as some do \) colleges have strict rules limiting earlydecision applications there is no reason that similar limitations cannot be imposed on all applications , benefiting everyone david j singer demarest , nj , nov 16 , 2014
allison williams ruined hatewatching it turns out this littleknown , 26yearold star of girls has a lovely singing voice as smooth as doublechurn caramel ice cream ms williams convincingly pulled off a british accent and was , all in all , a confident , lively and suitably impudent peter pan those who watched the musical on nbc on thursday in hopes of lighting up the twittersphere with catty commentary were doomed to disappointment whatever was wrong with this performance , and there s always something a bit off in a threehour live television show , it was n't ms williams it was n't christopher walken as captain hook , either , even though his voice was faint and he seemed at times to be rummaging for the next line mr walken was no cyril ritchard , the actor who played hook opposite mary martin in the original broadway production mr walken did n't chew the scenery , and he did n't enunciate the classic lines \( that s where the canker gahnaws \) with much brio but the actor brought his own sinewy charisma , stopstart diction and hoofer muscle memory to the part plus , in his flowing black wig and pirate costume , he looked like the fashion designer as johnny depp for  the gaudy , brightly colored neverland sets gave the show a pleasantly amateurish look , but technically this live staging of peter pan overseen by the executive producers neil meron and craig zadan and the director rob ashford was and difficult to stage than , which they put on nbc last year nobody fell or got tangled in their wires while flying there was no glitch with the computergenerated tinkerbell even the real dog who played nana did n't miss a mark this revival , however , was in other ways a lot easier to pull off there is really only one maria julie andrews and no theater revival or television special , however popular , can rival the enduring popularity of the 1965 movie taking on maria last year , carrie underwood sang beautifully , but she still seemed like  there are so many peter pans there s the one j m barrie described as oddly cocky , of course mary martin played peter onstage and in several legendary live productions on nbc sandy duncan and cathy rigby starred in revivals there was the animated disney movie of peter pan , and robin williams was peter in the 1991 movie hook a , and another movie , are due next year there is also a bus company , a peanut butter and a syndrome that all go by that name ms williams did n't have to step out of anyone s shadow \( besides peter pan s \) , but she did have to overcome her own , since she has had little public exposure besides lena dunham s hbo comedy , girls , where she plays marnie , a loathsome millennial whose main claim to singing talent is a  most of all , ms williams had to surmount the hype and overselling of nbc , a helicopter network that smothered this production with fulsome ads and inhouse synergy boosts , including a promo for the nbc news anchor brian williams , who is the actress s father mr williams skipped anchoring the evening news on thursday to watch his daughter s premiere , which is understandable the newscast s sizable segment about ms williams and her lifelong fascination with peter pan was less so thursday s show could n't entirely live up to nbc s puffedup expectations , and the energy sagged halfway through the performance was too long it ended at 11 pm , past the bedtime of its target audience of children and their grandparents , and it was possibly too ploddingly respectful there were chances to tighten and speed up the narrative that were n't taken instead , when i went home , a song that was cut from the original broadway version , was restored the television show did drop oh my mysterious lady , but songs from other musicals were added too many commercial interruptions helped deaden the pace the producers , worried about offending native americans , took one obvious liberty by of tiger lily s song , uggawugg , calling it true blood brothers they cast an unknown actress of cherokee descent , alanna saunders , 22 , as tiger lily and surrounded her with a tribe of dancers dressed , or undressed really , in less stereotypical storybook costumes though these nearnaked men gyrating like chippendales dancers were n't necessarily any more culturally sensitive the lost boys , meanwhile , looked like etonian football hooligans none of that matters it s hard to imagine that many viewers expected strict authenticity in neverland , a place where dreams are born , fairies flicker and pirates think to the tempo of a tarantella , but the show did n't want to take any chances peter pan live ! was a loving , lavish tribute to a beloved musical that offered a new generation of children a chance to use their smartphones to keep tinkerbell alive \( peter asked children to clap , but an nbc crawl urged them to also tweet \) it was a cautious , pleaseall production , but it took guts to do it
washington as lawmakers grapple with president obama s claim that he already has congressional authorization for airstrikes against the islamic state , legal specialists are saying that even legislative inaction could create a precedent leaving the executive branch with greater warmaking powers last week , the obama administration asserted that a military campaign in syria and iraq against the islamic state , also known as isis or isil , is covered by the existing and the but he said he needed new legislative authority for the related mission of providing military training for moderate rebels in syria the house and senate swiftly passed a rebeltraining bill , but it did not address the executive branch s claim about the 2001 and 2002 authorizations members of congress have also introduced a flurry of bills that would explicitly authorize force against the islamic state , but none repudiate the administration s interpretation of existing laws , either the obama legal team s broad interpretation of the old authorizations has drawn criticism but several legal specialists said that because congress was on notice about how the executive branch was interpreting its 2001 and 2002 statutes , any failure to challenge that theory especially as it enacted other legislation in connection with islamic state policy could be interpreted as ratifying it the supreme court has said that sometimes , congressional silence means congress has approved of what the executive has done , said barry friedman , a new york university law professor if congress , for political reasons , is unwilling or unable to speak up and the executive goes forward with its somewhat questionable theory , in the future , courts may well treat congress s silence as granting permission in a 1981 case , the supreme court ruled that congress had consented to a presidential power to suspend private lawsuits against iran in order to resolve the hostage crisis even though no statute explicitly granted that power , the court held that because congress knew the executive branch had claimed such authority and did not challenge it , it had acquiesced to its existence a similar issue arose concerning the national security agency s program that collects american s phone records in bulk , which is based on an expansive and interpretation of a provision in the patriot act in december , a federal district court judge the program in part because lawmakers knew or at least could have known how the provision was secretly being interpreted , and congress nevertheless reauthorized the patriot act without changes it is far from clear that anyone would have legal standing to bring before a court a dispute regarding mr obama s authority to wage war questions about the scope of the 2001 law have come up in court challenges by detainees from the afghanistan war , but airstrikes do not involve prisoners , and the administration is not planning to resume american wartime detention operations in iraq still , the obama administration s broad claims , and the fact that congress has done nothing to push back , may become a precedent that the executive branch could use for future interpretations of statutory authorizations to use military force , said jack goldsmith , a harvard law school professor and former justice department official a related issue runs through various bills introduced by members of congress that would provide explicit authority to fight the islamic state there appears to be little political appetite among congressional leaders to vote on the issue before the midterm elections in november , but several congressional staff members said such a bill may be taken up in the lameduck session at the end of the year several republican bills would provide sweeping authority for air and ground warfare , including openended legislation introduced by republican lawmakers like of virginia and of oklahoma an otherwise similar bill by representative , republican of california , would expire after 120 days several democrats have introduced bills to permit a more limited air war , including , of florida , whose law would expire after three years representative of california , 18 months and senator of virginia , one year those bills explicitly say they do not include authority for any major use of ground troops , and the last two restrict the geographical scope of authorizing fighting to iraq and syria but mr goldsmith that such limits are entirely ineffective because they would not prevent the executive branch from evading them by citing the 2001 law as separate authority in an interview , mr schiff questioned the legitimacy of relying on the old al qaeda law to get around the limits of a new one that focuses on the islamic state , but said his bill could easily be adjusted to foreclose that he also said that after the election , congress should repeal the 2001 and 2002 authorizations and enact a new law that sets out the scope and limits of authority to go after al qaeda and the islamic state
ten years ago i wrote a book called that s it told the story of how the magazine publishing business that i built in china , fighting all the way , mostly with the government bureaus that controlled media , was taken from me by the government , destroying my career the publishers of the book were excited about the project we knew the story would upset powerful people in china we love controversy , they said that s what publishing is all about at the last minute the publishers sent a review copy to their representative office in beijing , whose response was we will never be able to develop business in china if you publish this the publication was canceled my editor admitted in private that they were afraid i was familiar with the power of the chinese government i had dealt with censors content inspectors , as they preferred to be known on a daily basis , face to face i had listened to them explain we like a controversy we love an argument but we ca n't let your readers have one , especially if they are chinese from time to time i did upset the censors i was accused of supporting independence for taiwan , interfering in the tibet question , encouraging falun gong , the religious sect , selling sexual services , pornography and , ultimately , muslim separatism yet every time i got into trouble , it was not because the censors themselves had read and found something upsetting it was because my commercial rivals had found it for them censorship was a commercial tool , a weapon in your business arsenal you used it to hurt people my magazines lost thousands of dollars in revenue thanks to the sexual services complaint , which was directed at our personal classified advertising the competitor behind that attack went on to launch its own classifieds section , which ran pages of massage service advertisements offering happy endings today , many of the same political and corporate leaders who complain about chinese censorship and its harsh consequences like the detention of writers such as the nobel peace prize recipient liu xiaobo quietly accept the censorship of the chinese communist party themselves some even selfcensor , in order not to upset the party or even , much worse , to avoid damaging their prospects of making money in china the south africans denied the dalai lama a visa the 2012 london book fair allowed the chinese general administration of press and publication \( my old adversary \) to dictate the guest list , and to bar another chinese winner , gao xingjian , who lives in exile in france in november , top executives from international tech firms including facebook , linkedin and apple attended the inaugural world internet conference in zhejiang province access to many of the attendees' sites and services is blocked in china , but none of them publicly raised the matter with the host , a state agency , despite the opportunity nor did any of them comment on the irony , at least in public in march , reader s digest made cuts to a publication being printed in china , at the request of the printer in the same month the chairman of bloomberg publicly questioned whether his organization should have rethought its coverage of politically sensitive news in china the world is falling over itself to please the chinese communist party we call it china , but that is a flag of convenience , a banana leaf to cover our embarrassment one of the communist party s outstanding feats , one of its greatest successes , is the creation of an intangible , terrifying impression of a vast invisible force , a monster in the next room it has no name , no identity it is the spirit of the party , the ghosts of the revolutionary martyrs even the leaders themselves are afraid of it if you cannot give something a name , you cannot speak to it or reason with it all you can do is fear it the system thrives on fear yet the party is itself very afraid of the people hence the censorship and punishment of those who dare to speak out now the party s monster is striking fear into the western world it controls the only hope , as the leaders of the west would have it , for the world economy it must be appeased yet leaders of western governments and major corporations rail against the censorship , the repression of writers and thinkers and human rights such double standards delight the chinese communist party it has coopted the west into playing by its own rules , where hypocrisy is rule no1 , where everyone is guilty to some extent and can be held to account at the convenience of whoever is in charge and the world is putting china in charge it is a very old and very clever chinese political maneuver to the party , chinese supremacy is only natural , a reversion to how things should always have been , if not for the industrial revolution and a few other blips in world history china is the rightful leader of the civilized world as did the suzerain states that surrounded it centuries ago , the world again sends tribute in the hope that china will treat it with favor , and the party takes that as confirmation of its elevated position , takes the tribute for granted and sees the donor as weak , while the foreign government or corporation congratulates itself on being promised access to the chinese market , or chinese investment in its country or companies they forget , or ignore the fact , that the chinese market is for the chinese , and so are the profits at the apec conference in beijing in early november , china censorship , how it works , how it should be stood up to , and how western governments could deal with it came together in one brief moment at the final press conference a new york times journalist asked president xi jinping about the issuing of china visas for foreign correspondents the new york times has had difficulty getting visas since it ran a story about the private wealth of senior party members , the same topic bloomberg wanted to rethink mr xi all but ignored the question president obama , standing to one side , turned to the media , raised his eyebrows , smiled and shrugged let s hope that was a shrugging off , and not a gesture of acceptance
in his final home opener as a yankee , derek jeter scored once after a double that came tantalizingly close to a home run , and the yankees beat the orioles , 42 , on a chilly day at yankee stadium monday while jeter did not make any plays to add to his career highlight reel , he was warmly applauded by fans on several occasions and played a central role in a yankees victory that was what the sellout crowd of 48 , 142 came to see jeter postgame when asked if he d take a memento from today s game i think steiner takes everything yankees http tco x8weklgydd  justin sablich \( jsablichnyt \) 7 apr 14 among the memorable games and plays involving derek jeter , monday s home opener against the baltimore orioles will not vault to the top of the list there was no signature moment , no defining play where jeter put his indelible stamp upon the game but the result was very jeterlike the yankees won , 42 , and with a 43 record they topped 500 for the first time this season jeter , who announced in february that he will retire after the season , was given a couple of warm standing ovations , but there was no overwhelming outpouring of love that will surely come later in the season as he gets closer to the end i don t know how i m going to react , jeter said before the game i don t know how i m going to feel but i do understand what my priorities are my priorities have always been straight since i ve gotten here and they re not going to change just because it s my last year hiroki kuroda , the yankee starting pitcher , received an ovation as loud as any jeter heard , when he walked off the mound in the seventh inning , having given his team a terrific performance jeter led off the fifth with a double that hit the left field wall , missing a home run by inches he didn t run particularly hard coming out of the box , but then hustled to beat the throw to second base , barely sliding in ahead of the tag orioles manager buck showalter came out to discuss it but did not challenge the call because replays showed jeter was indeed safe  david waldstein the yankees sold 48 , 142 tickets for today s game , which qualifies as a sellout here in the bottom of the eighth , maybe half that many are in attendance but the stadium was mostly full through the first six innings the cold has driven many people to the subway yankees still lead , 42 david phelps came on to get the last out of the seventh inning and the yankees are now six outs away from victory with a 42 lead in the bottom of the seventh kuroda threw 92 pitches , 56 of them for strikes , over six and onethird innings his two runs were earned as he struck out four and walked none after allowing a double and two singles , kuroda was pulled from the game in the seventh inning he pitched well enough to win today , but that will be up to matt thornton and the yankees bullpen the orioles have runners on second and third with two outs it s cold here , but not as cold as it was for jeter s first home opener on april 9 , 1996 most fans remember that game for the snow and frigid temperatures in the 30s i was absolutely stunned there were that many people here , george steinbrenner said at the time everyone was stunned by it dimaggio sat through the whole thing it was unbelievable steinbrenner was referring to the 45 , 000 fans who were thought to have been in attendance that day batting ninth , jeter was 1 for 5 with a run batted in the yankees 73 victory , but was just a footnote that day in the papers harvey araton wrote so opening day went on in the bronx , though jim leyritz said he couldn t see home plate once while leading off third and shortstop derek jeter said he couldn t pick up the ball as it came off the bat and young andy pettitte s important left arm was exposed to risk we re now in the top of the seventh , the wind is picking up , the sky is darkening , and the yankees are still leading , 41 we re still in the bottom of the fifth inning at yankee stadium and the yankees just added to their lead with a twoout , bases loaded walk to kelly johnson the yanks loaded the bases with singles by beltran and soriano , followed by a walk to brian roberts jeter was inches away from blowing the roof off this place incredible because yankee stadium doesn t even have a roof with a shot to left field that bounced off the top of the wall jeter thought it was a homer as he trotted down the first base line , but picked up the pace just in time to slide safely into second base jeter would come around to score on a single by ellsbury one of the loudest ovations during the pregame ceremonies was for yangervis solarte , the 26yearold rookie who clawed his way onto the roster this spring his eight hits during the opening road trip quickly endeared him to yankees fans and here today in the bottom of the fourth he s come through again , driving in a run with a line drive to right that was nearly caught by a diving markakis i m looking forward to april , 2034 , yangervis solarte s last opening day  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 7 apr 14 adam jones , who singled with one out , came around to score on a single by matt wieters with two outs the second out came on a fantastic leaping catch , deep into foul territory in left , by gardner to retire the dangerous chris davis kuroda has been mostly sharp through four innings , allowing four hits and striking out three he has yet to walk a batter through 55 pitches three yankees catchers and a reggie http tco uzb9sjszkw  lindsay berra \( lindsayberra \) 7 apr 14 beltran hit a dribbler to the pitcher and we ll head to the fourth inning with the yankees up 10 spotting a no 2 jeter shirt or jersey at yankee stadium has never been challenging , but you ll probably see even more of them this season check our website later tonight for more on that for now , here s an interesting stat since february 12 , when he said that 2014 would be his last season , jeter merchandise has been the topseller on the website fanaticscom that s not too surprising , but jeter merchandise as a whole is up over 600 percent compared to april 2013 and more was sold in march than the last four marches combined , according to the website that s a lot it was far from a special moment , but the ball came off of jeter s bat and a runner scored as a result ! but the result was a 163 double play after jeter grounded one back to the pitcher ellsbury followed with his first yankees hit at yankee stadium beltran is up with two outs let s see if ellsbury tries to take second base backtoback singles by solarte and gardner has runners on the corners with nobody out for jeter baltimore s nelson cruz was so excited to be a part of jeter s final home opener that he forgot how many outs there were in the top of the second inning i cannot confirm that but he did forget how many outs there were when he took off to second base on a oneout flyout to center field and was easily doubled up at first base we re still scoreless in the bottom of the second it was not a storybook start to jeter s day he struck out swinging as part of a onetwothree inning jeter was all business while crowd stands and cheers he s gotta hit  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 7 apr 14 crowd wanted to keep cheering , but jeter had to pay attention to the pitcher if ubaldo steps off , it could have been quite a moment  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 7 apr 14 it just isn t the official gametime temperature was 52 degrees , but tell that to my knit hat and coat here in the press box it certainly feels colder , and i m far from the only one bundled up based on a quick scan of the yankee stadium crowd kuroda had a relatively easy first inning , outside of a oneout double by nick markakis jeter will have his first atbat in just a few moments i hope the increase in decibels has a warming effect thunderous applause , obviously , for rivera , pettitte , posada and jeter before the ceremonial first pitch baseball is not a popularity contest , except when it comes to voting for the allstar team , but if it was , jeter would fare well , at least when you talk to most new yorkers a new york times ny1 siena college poll that was released this morning shows that 91 percent of yankees fans view jeter favorably \( compared to 54 percent who view alex rodriguez unfavorably also according to the poll , twothirds of yankees fans said they expected their team to be in the playoffs this year and 6 in 10 of the team s fans said rodriguez s absence this season would not affect the yankees chances of making the playoffs the pollsters even found a mets fan who didn t have nasty things to say about jeter as a mets fan , i have great disdain for the yankees but derek jeter is a great ballplayer he s been marvelous not only is he technically good , but his attitude toward the game is good , said mark joseph , 81 , of manhattan he s a good example for young people heck , he s a good example for us all i m just sorry he wasn t a met derek jeter chant from bleacher creatures and a quick glove wave crowd loves it  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 7 apr 14 the seats are filling up as the yankees players are announced masahiro tanaka received one of the loudest ovations in his introduction to yankee stadium outside of jeter s jeter gets a big applause , of course , but it wasn t very long because the next player , jacoby ellsbury , was introduced shortly after  david waldstein \( davidwaldstein \) 7 apr 14 this is jeter being introduced at yankee stadium http tco l9jdnl5x63  justin sablich \( jsablichnyt \) 7 apr 14 as we near game time \( 1 08 pm eastern \) , the baseline introductions have begun the most anticipated part will be at the end , when andy pettitte and mariano rivera will throw out the ceremonial first pitches to jeter and jorge posada it s been well over three years since the four have played in the same game it was game 2 of the 2010 american league division series against the minnesota twins pettitte tossed seven strong innings and rivera closed out the 52 victory jeter drove in the goahead run in the seventh inning while posada was hitless in three atbats the next time they will all play together will be at old timer s day next summer jeter s no stranger to making a splash on opening days , and today will be his last chance his first major league homer came off 40yearold dennis martinez in the first game of the 1996 season in cleveland i don t know what to expect from derek , joe torre said at the time the only thing that i require and hopefully come to expect is that he play solid defense because when you re dealing with shortstops that s what you look for , and whatever offense you get the most memorable moment from an opening day at yankee stadium had to be in 2006 with the yankees trailing the royals 7 6 , with two out , two on in the bottom of the eighth , jeter pulled the first pitch he saw from kansas city reliever ambiorix burgos into the leftfield seats and lifting the yankees to a victory today s starting lineups for balnyy , jeter s last home opener http tco 8t6befckpq  justin sablich \( jsablichnyt \) 7 apr 14 monday will be the last time derek jeter puts on the pinstripes for an opening day at yankee stadium but in typical jeter fashion , he is trying to keep all that sentimental stuff at a distance and seems more concerned about making up for last season , when he was not healthy enough to take part in the team s home opener it almost doesn t feel like the season is underway until you get to your home opener , jeter said sunday especially missing last year , i m looking forward to this one the yankees are well aware of the significance of monday s game , bringing in the rest of the core four , jorge posada , andy pettitte and mariano rivera , to help jeter with the ceremonial first pitch jeter s farewell souvenir collection got off to an interesting start , including a set of pinstripe boots from the houston astros the yankees are probably saving theirs for later in the season \( a pinstripe ford f150 , maybe \? \) , but expect plenty of long , standing ovations from the home fans , who get their first opportunity to shower him with their appreciation the yankees were 33 on the season s opening road trip hiroki kuroda will start against baltimore s ubaldo jimenez jeter is coming off his best game of the young season , going 2 for 5 against the toronto blue jays those two hits brought jeter another milestone \( get used to hearing that this season \) he passed paul molitor to move into eighth place on the career hits list with 3 , 320 it s definitely special , jeter said after sunday s game but i m not going to go home and celebrate because we have a game tomorrow but it s something i take a lot of pride in
tradition is a guide , not a jailer that quotation from w somerset maugham is the motto of , an africanamerican string band during the group s rollicking , revelatory concert at the brooklyn academy of music on thursday , there was plenty of oldtime , southern banjo and fiddle music from the early 20th century , and even from 1855 , but there were also scottish highlands mouth music and an rb hit from 2001 the band members spoke of learning tunes from an 80yearold black fiddler and also off youtube they know their history and want to share it the ridiculously charismatic singer and fiddler rhiannon giddens deftly clued the audience in on the africanamerican origins of the banjo but she did not let the heavy parts of that history \( no one onstage wants to go back to 1855 \) weigh down the drive of the dance music , even if , as she said , the chocolate drops were being a dance band as never before the as never before part came in the second quarter of the show , when the band was joined by and , two stars of new york city ballet , for cornbread duet , five songs choreographed by none other than , the queen of mixing vernacular dance and classical ballet there were corn bread inflections flexed feet and faked flatfooting in between the fou ttes and pirouettes la seconde but was ballet , a traditionally structured pas de deux with these dancers , it was ballet at a high level mr fairchild brought his usual exuberance and ease ms peck applied her phenomenal speed and musicality but ms tharp s choreography did n't say much more than ballet can be danced to this music if her work felt less like a standalone creation than a highclass endorsement of the band , it did jibe with the band s motto in a slinky adagio that put pressure on all three words in the title of the song to which it was set the awestruck ms giddens seemed content with this demonstration , but there was more physical wit in the bones playing of her colleagues , miming golf swings and the application of aerosol deodorant and the point about tradition was better made by , a white dancer with a punkish haircut who , during the concert s second half , freely combined appalachian clogging with hiphop uprock and the charleston though adlibbed , intermittent and off to the side , ms oleson s dancing was a vivid embodiment of the chocolate drop sound and the historically hybrid american vernacular she does what we do , ms giddens said so does ms tharp , though she has done it much better than in cornbread duet
south williamsport , pa between her and the start of eighth grade , mo'ne davis has a trip planned for a round of talk show appearances i 've got to get my answers straight , davis , 13 , said with a smile after her team was eliminated from the series on thursday night every question i can think of , i have to know the answer to one of the questions already being asked is this after becoming the first girl to throw a shutout at the series , a ratings bonanza for espn , a cover subject for sports illustrated and a national figure of inspiration , should davis try to cash in on her celebrity \? sports marketing experts agree that davis and her family must decide quickly but few athletes face such significant decisions at such a young age estimates on her earning potential vary widely it is unclear whether the acceptance of money would compromise davis s amateur status and eligibility to play high school sports at the private school she attends in philadelphia are complicated and , and each case is considered individually but at this point there may be some leeway to accept endorsements mark williams , davis s stepfather , said the family would proceed cautiously , given that the 5foot4 davis aspires to play point guard at the university of connecticut , the ninetime women s basketball champion williams said he had rebuffed an inquiry about a potential book deal at the end of the day , she has a dream to play for uconn , so we 're not taking anything until we 're clear on that , because her dream is her dream , williams said that s her decision we 're not taking anything none of us would like to ruin that dream if davis and her family decide to pursue commercial endorsements , the window of opportunity is absolutely this moment , said doug shabelman , president of burns entertainment , which matches marketers and celebrities for commercial endorsements the public s memory is a lot shorter than it used to be , shabelman said though davis played with great composure and had remarkable success as a pitcher in the series , she is expected to move quickly out of the limelight with football season beginning , shabelman said and she did not win a championship , which would have broadened her appeal to advertisers davis might be able to earn 5 , 000 to 25 , 000 from a sports drink deal , shabelman said it was a great little run , but there s not going to be vast money from this unless she gets a movie done about her or a tv show , which is very unlikely , he said other experts estimated that davis s earning potential could be much higher , perhaps 100 , 000 a year alone from a shoe and apparel deal , and that , in the right circumstances , she might be able to pay for college without needing an athletic scholarship a baseball signed by davis sold wednesday for 510 on ebay bob dorfman , the executive creative director at baker street advertising in san francisco and a sports marketing analyst , said he thought davis could earn up to 500 , 000 as a teenage role model endorsing products from sports drinks to cellphones , computers , school supplies and fashion if it was my kid , why not \? dorfman said she seems awfully poised she seems like she can handle it having pitched in front of crowds of more than 30 , 000 fans at the little league world series , davis plans to begin playing girls' varsity soccer and basketball , with far smaller audiences , at springside chestnut hill academy in philadelphia its teams play in the interacademic league , a conference of elite private schools , which is not bound by the governing rules of the pennsylvania interscholastic athletic association on friday , officials at davis s school were trying to determine whether league bylaws governed her ability to accept endorsements and remain eligible for varsity sports we 're in an unprecedented situation with this kind of extraordinary talent at such a young age , said kate noel , the school s director of external affairs for college eligibility in sports other than football and men s basketball , athletes are not considered prospects until they reach the ninth grade , the ncaa said davis has not yet begun eighth grade , so it is unclear exactly how the rules will later apply to her also , athletes can be considered professional in one sport and amateur in another , as when minor league baseball players remain eligible to play college football so if davis accepted endorsements related to baseball but planned to play basketball in college , she might not be risking her future eligibility as much once enrolled in college , the studentathlete would be expected to take the necessary steps to ensure that these ads are no longer being used , said christopher radford , an ncaa spokesman given the legal tumult involving the ncaa , the rules could change significantly by the time davis enters college in five years ultimately , it s a family decision , but mo'ne has a unique , timely and potentially lucrative opportunity to take another step for all female athletes , said lindsay kagawa colas , the vice president of action and olympic sports at the wasserman media group in los angeles she s inspiring people of all ages , particularly girls she s a hero for them now
los angeles baseball reveals itself slowly , a sixmonth process of data collection that gives wellreasoned answers about ways to win then the postseason begins and the fun really starts because no matter what we think we know , october does not care those thousands of small samples that make up the regular season , when viewed individually , become chaotic all with a championship at stake that s what makes baseball great , john mozeliak said friday night , as he navigated a swarm of ashen los angeles dodgers fans on his way to the visiting clubhouse after a mindbending national league division series opener mozeliak , the general manager of the st louis cardinals , said it could take a while to process what he had seen no kidding the dodgers and the cardinals had just played a game started by clayton kershaw and adam wainwright , who combined to go 4112 with a 209 earned run average this season , and the final score was 109 , cardinals there s no explanation for why that happened , said matt carpenter , the cardinals' third baseman who can explain anything this time of year \? yes , madison bumgarner threw a shutout in pittsburgh to win the nl wildcard game for the san francisco giants but seven other aces kershaw , wainwright , jon lester , james shields , max scherzer , justin verlander and stephen strasburg have taken the mound without any one meeting the minimum requirements for a quality start those seven have combined for 20 career allstar selections they have also combined for a 730 era this postseason even the length of games took a wild turn by this postseason s standards when the san francisco giants' 21 win over the washington nationals in 18 innings tied a record for most innings played in a postseason game the baltimore orioles took a twogamestonone lead on the detroit tigers in their bestoffive american league division series , helped by delmon young s gamebreaking threerun double in game 2 this is the same player whose 317 career onbase percentage and poor defense have contributed to just 25 wins above replacement , as calculated by the baseballreference website , in the majors yet young just keeps showing up in october he has been to the postseason six years in a row , with four teams in 2012 , he was the most valuable player of the american league championship series for detroit last year , after an ordinary four and a half months in philadelphia , he joined the tampa bay rays and homered in their wildcard win another unlikely winner in the first week of the postseason ned yost , the manager of the kansas city royals yost used a rookie starter , yordano ventura , in relief at a critical moment of the wildcard game with oakland , and promptly watched a threerun homer sail over the centerfield fence the royals won anyway then they won twice against the los angeles angels , each in 11 innings , even though yost stuck steadfastly to convention by refusing to use his overpowering closer , greg holland , in a tie game on the road he waited for a lead to use holland , and both times the royals got the lead on a home run never mind that they hit the fewest in the majors in the regular season by contrast , the angels led the majors in runs but have scored just three times in 22 innings mike trout , the presumptive al most valuable player , has been held without a hit although there may be nothing we can count on in october , lately , at least , there is usually this the cardinals' offense , which has helped them win six of eight postseason series since 2011 the names change , but the character of the hitters stays the same they 're never going to give anything away , dodgers catcher a j ellis said of the cardinals after game 1 that s what s impressive about them their atbats are a fight just the culture of their team that they have , even though on paper they might be overmatched by a dominant pitcher , they do n't know it or they act like they do n't know it in 2011 , the cardinals lost their division series opener to the phillies' roy halladay , then fell behind , 40 , to cliff lee in game 2 by the time lee was finished , with nobody out in the seventh , he had given up 12 hits and five runs the cardinals went on to beat halladay and zack greinke as they advanced through the nl playoffs , then crushed the texas rangers' bullpen to win the world series they thumped jordan zimmermann , gio gonzalez , bumgarner and tim lincecum in the 2012 playoffs they bruised kershaw in the nlcs clincher last fall , and did so again on friday impervious , as usual , to opposing aces this time of year , that s all you 're really going to run into , the cardinals' matt holliday said so you have no choice if you 're waiting for the 4 or 5 starter that does n't throw that good stuff , you 're going to be waiting awhile holliday cited carpenter as a hitter who never gives away atbats and personifies the cardinals' approach carpenter chased kershaw on friday with a basesclearing double to cap an eightpitch duel , a virtual repeat of a pivotal confrontation in last year s playoffs carpenter , who led the nl in walks this season , averaged 436 pitches per plate appearance , well above the major league average of 382 this guy , he s the epitome of a professional grinder on their side , ellis said this guy s as tough an out as there is in the national league , especially when the stakes are raised maybe so but last oct 30 in boston , when the stakes were as high as could be two outs , ninth inning , the season in the balance against koji uehara carpenter struck out to end the world series it was a final , shining example of the only real truth about october nobody knows anything
armyansk , ukraine if anyone wonders if russia and its supporters in crimea are serious about holding on to territory that is still formally part of ukraine , the de facto border checkpoint near this shabby garrison town on the northern edge of the peninsula dispels any doubt the mystery men whom everyone takes for armed and masked russian troops without insignia on their uniforms were here en masse , and they seem to have dug in for the long haul at what is clearly intended as a marker of a new border between the largely russianspeaking crimea and the rest of ukraine facts on the ground like these are driving tensions ever higher in perhaps the worst eastwest confrontation since the cold war and , as in the georgianrussian war in 2008 , the language of confrontation is roadblocks , territorial claims and swiftly organized shows of popular support from shadowy selfdefense groups to poorly prepared referendums used to legitimize steps already taken one big difference from georgia is that , although crimea has for centuries been a bitterly contested prize , there has been little history of overt ethnic tension since world war ii , when locals battled the nazis and stalin deported the crimean tatars , a turkic muslim people , to central asia now , in a strange ghost of a conflict , a previously calm , if impoverished , population of two million has been whipped into anxiety and dread by war talk and mounting suspicion people who admit that they would never have done so even two weeks ago now identify to which percentage they are ukrainian , russian , tatar or some other nationality at military sites across crimea , ukrainian forces have been neutralized but not evacuated , forced into a strange bond with the mystery men by a mutual determination so far to avoid bloodshed and provocation on wednesday , at least 10 kamaz trucks of the kind seen transporting russian soldiers across crimea in recent days were parked in a large field to the left of the road leading up to the checkpoint here the uniformed men had pitched the type of large khaki tent that could be used as a field kitchen and canteen or possibly as sleeping quarters a few hundred yards beyond the tent and the trucks was what had been a traffic police station , like those that dot roads across the former soviet union this one , firmly on ukrainian territory , had clearly been taken over by prorussia forces , with two large russian flags flying at its edge also visible was the red , blue and green flag of kuban cossacks , who traditionally inhabit a black sea region to the east of the crimean peninsula an armored personnel carrier was positioned on the side of the road as reporters drove up from the crimean side , with a second personnel carrier blocking the road farther up cinder blocks and sandbags were piled around the edge of the traffic post and across the road to slow any vehicles passing in either direction refusing to talk to reporters , six of the men in unmarked uniforms discussed in russian whether to go for a wash , pulling identical small white towels out of their kits in general , no one was willing to talk , or to allow photographers and reporters to get close enough to observe the installation reporters who had arrived by late morning saw two men in distinctive cossack uniforms helping the soldiers keep a careful watch on vehicles coming through from crimea one of the soldiers appeared to be writing down license plate numbers , while a couple of others examined documents before allowing vehicles to head north reporters who arrived just two hours later saw at least 20 kuban cossacks in combat fatigues and lambskin hats staffing the checkpoint , all equipped with newlooking automatic weapons a highly unusual sight for a group known more for its skill on horseback none of the photographers , television crews or other journalists who arrived during the morning were allowed closer than about 100 yards from the post the armed men quite firmly , if politely , kept everyone away , even a crew from russia today , the 24hour station funded by the russian government a man introduced to the first group of reporters as the commander made clear there was to be no talking and no approach the second group of reporters was introduced to a masked man in the uniform of the berkut secret police used by the former ukrainian president , viktor f yanukovych , to attack protesters in kiev who the cossacks said was the commander he suggested to that group of reporters that they could take a smaller road out of crimea what was unclear was whether reporters would have been allowed back in in general , there seemed to be almost no traffic coming in , while perhaps a dozen vehicles some longhaul trucks , others private vans and cars crossed in the space of 30 minutes toward the north and the ukrainian district of kherson the narrow neck leading out of crimea s northwest toward kherson , and territory farther to the east , have for centuries been a battleground they control access to miles and miles of plains rolling south to the regional capital , simferopol , and on toward the hills and dramatic coastline of the black sea it was in this region that the russians stormed tatar fortifications during a war with the turks in the early 18th century , clearing the way for their eventual control over what had been led by a turkic khan in 1920 , the bolsheviks triumphed in the region now , conflict seems to have descended once more to the south of armyansk , a bus stop in the small town of ishun bore a token of how this formerly peaceful peninsula had been grabbed and torn in just the past week putin no to war ! read the sign , spraypainted in russian farther south , in simferopol , a united nations envoy , robert serry , got a taste of the enmity now roiling the region on wednesday evening as an angry local crowd surrounded him mr serry , a dutch diplomat , was eventually forced to take refuge in a cafe before agreeing to go straight to the airport the message that outsiders are not necessarily welcome has been mounting in recent days , as prorussian crowds or selfappointed selfdefense forces have rallied around the mystery men outside military bases , and ukrainians inside have surrendered their weapons while declining to leave territory they feel a duty to protect in yevpatoriya , a resort town northeast of simferopol , the ukrainian commander , col andrei matvienko , a career officer stationed there since 1997 , has allowed 40 armed men , whom he identified as russians , to take up shared supervision of his missile defense unit his 200 men have surrendered their arms , he said , in the name of avoiding a clash though tucked into a residential complex , the base has been the scene of confrontations for days the truth will be with us , was what he offered as an eventual outcome as for which side has right on its side , colonel matvienko said as a soldier with a grenade launcher walked past , draw your own conclusions
the main event of the past week was , of course , the midterm elections it was a republican romp , far greater than any poll predicted , but for those watching it from abroad it was also a striking lesson in the enormous complexity , expense , passion and mystery of the democratic process as practiced in the world s premier republic all robust democracies surround elections with a circus atmosphere of stump speeches , tv debates , ceaseless polls , ads and posters but none can surpass the united states in the range of offices that come up for election every two years , from the entire house of representatives to scores of senators , governors , judges , local legislators and prosecutors , or the resolutions on issues like legalizing marijuana and few spend anywhere near as much around 4 billion was spent on this election it s not all pretty , what with the prevalence of the attack ads and shameless lies nor is the mood of the american electorate understandable to a foreign observer why do american voters feel so strong a need to punish president obama when the economy is in decent shape , unemployment is falling , most troops are home from foreign wars and the political gridlock in washington is hardly his fault alone \? the apparent reason is that americans are deeply dissatisfied with the way they are being governed the departing congress is widely reviled for its dysfunction , polarization and lack of achievement , and at times like this , people punish the president and his party that may not seem fair or reasonable , but offering a legitimate channel for frustration and anger , and endowing the public with a sense that they can do something about it , is a key component of democracy twentyfive years ago , the people of east berlin did something about their frustrations in a far different way , bursting through the wall that had physically denied them and millions of eastern europeans the most elemental freedoms with the approach of sunday s anniversary , however , many commentaries have focused on the dashed hopes and lost illusions of that joyous moment russia is again looming as a threat , china has found ways of combining authoritarian rule with economic might , the united states is widely perceived around the world as having misused its monopoly on superpower , the middle east is locked in sectarian rivalries that spread vicious terror far beyond the region , and democracy appears on the defensive against populist challenges and economic troubles none of that should detract from the sheer joy that was nov 9 , 1989 , in berlin , when people who had lived under the threat of repression for thinking the wrong thought or dreaming the wrong dream suddenly found themselves free i was there that night , and at many of the other celebrations across eastern europe and , yes , russia , that collectively came to be known as the fall of the wall many recognized at the time that this was a plunge into the unknown , and many had fears and doubts about where it would all lead but at the moment when the formidable forces of repression created by the soviet union and its minions retreated before the power of the human spirit , there could be only celebration as there was , unforgettably , that night in berlin , and as there should be on this anniversary over the past 25 years we have learned that building democracy requires more than triumphant moments like that night in berlin or the many days and nights of the arab spring in middle eastern capitals however exhilarating it may be to topple statues of dictators and sack the offices of the political police , these are symptoms of a failure of the social contract , and not a guarantee that a new one will work better democracy is institutions , a culture , a history , a process democracy is not what transpired in the sham elections held on nov 2 in donetsk and luhansk , the ukrainian cities and surrounding areas held by prorussian separatists though many of the people who cast ballots may have honestly believed they were helping end the chaos in which they 've lived for more than half a year now , the elections called by leaders of the selfproclaimed peoples' republics served only to freeze the conflict , leaving residents in limbo the elections come a week after parliamentary elections in the rest of ukraine , with a predictable victory for parties favoring a closer union with the west the united states , the european union and the united nations refused to recognize the voting in the rebel territories , and the government in kiev condemned it as a violation of a ceasefire agreement laid out by president vladimir v putin of russia in september one result was that ukraine cut off all state funding to rogue territories russia welcomed the elections , declaring that the peoples' republics now had legitimate representatives to negotiate with kiev on their future status moscow can also claim it is responding to legitimate demands for assistance when it funds and otherwise props up the rebel territories nato says hundreds of russian troops are still inside eastern ukraine training rebel soldiers for now , the net effect is that russia has added two more unrecognized states and frozen conflicts to its collection , alongside south ossetia , abkhazia and transnistria that may suit president putin just fine , but not his economy the past week was the worst for the ruble in many years , dropping the russian currency to alltime lows against the dollar and the euro even if the midterm elections in the united states were not cause for celebration , given the sour mood of the electorate , the low turnout and the partisan attacks , they did demonstrate that there is a way to effect change other than through barricades or sham ballots the change may not be for the better this time around it is possible that a congress now fully in republican hands will only deepen the ugly duel with the democratic president that has so damaged washington in recent years but there will be new elections in two years it could also be that a lameduck president in need of a legacy , a congress in need of salvaging its brand and a republican party looking two years ahead will find ways to cut some deals initial signals were mixed , but already on the day after the election there was talk of various walls that could be breached , like reforming the tax code , promoting trade and eliminating the budget deficit
washington the most sumptuous room in the of the general services administration has floortoceiling oak panels , chandeliers and a working fireplace carved of french limestone but the suite is no longer the private preserve of the administrator of the agency , daniel m tangherlini , and instead is filled with modern conference desks , a white board and two flatpanel televisions that block the fireplace mr tangherlini has a small desk with a laptop and a phone in a new , wideopen space with dozens of other employees , most of whom have no assigned desks your role or position in the hierarchy is not determined by square footage , mr tangherlini said the agency is capitalizing on the reality that on any given day in washington , large numbers of government employees' desks sit empty because so many people work from home or travel for their jobs so now , the vast majority of the 3 , 300 employees at gsa headquarters must participate in what the agency calls hoteling , a desksharing program requiring employees to reserve their work stations either daily or weekly in advance as a result , the agency s recently renovated downtown washington headquarters at 18th and f streets , just two blocks from the white house , looks more like the airy spaces at google s silicon valley offices and less like the lumbering bureaucracy that manages and supports the federal agencies and still uses floppydisk technology most work stations in the headquarters are bare of the family photos and children s drawings of yesteryear , but a sixstory art installation can be seen from many desks along one side of the lightfilled building on the days they are physically there , employees bring in their laptops and plug into desks that they have reserved through an online booking system , which includes maps of the building and email reminders sent out before the reservations begin on a recent day , the office was mostly empty except for small hives of activity where people had settled in clusters to work in teams for komal rasheed , 31 , a senior adviser on policy and strategy at the agency , the change has been welcome it really changed dramatically how this agency works and collaborates , she said she finds it liberating and freeing , she said , to work at different desks throughout the agency and to meet with other workers no longer chained to their same desks \( she locates them through instant messaging \) over all , she said , her productivity has increased but in a capital where many government workers are used to spacious offices or private cubicles , not everyone is as enthusiastic some employees none of whom wanted to be identified complaining about the changes imposed by their superiors said they found the new system inconvenient , cumbersome or bad for morale without a permanent desk , they said , they feel less connected to the agency and their coworkers this is n't necessarily going to be easy for any one group , because it s a complete change from how you work , when you work , where you work , said mika cross , a workplace transformation strategist working as a fellow at the government s office of personnel management in a recent survey of government resource managers by the , which works to promote telecommuting in the federal government , traditional office culture was seen as the biggest barrier to the new office plans successfully working in the new spaces requires a huge cultural change , said kate lister , president of , a company that conducts research on telecommuting government agencies offer telework training sessions and the gsa website includes numerous pages devoted to how to use the new work stations , including etiquette rules for sharing desks you do n't just send someone out into the open offices and say , well , have fun ! ' ms lister said a variety of studies and surveys have found , however , that employees who work at least partly from home are more likely to show job satisfaction and can be more productive than their colleagues who do not \( time they would spend commuting is instead spent working \) so far , only a small portion of the federal bureaucracy is trying out the desksharing program , including parts of the united states patent and trademark office and the departments of agriculture and homeland security the fish and wildlife service and the broadcasting board of governors have pilot programs , too gsa officials , who consider it part of their mission to push other agencies to keep their real estate costs down , are alone in embracing the program nearly 100 percent at their headquarters the agency s initiative is more familiar in parts of the private sector , especially at hightech startups shared desks are also in use in offices of the drugmaker glaxosmithkline and the consulting firms deloitte and accenture after a series of snowstorms in 2010 shut down much of washington , congress passed a law directing federal agencies to establish policies for working remotely the added bonus , at least as far as the general services administration is concerned , is that with a more mobile work force , there can be less office space to pay for still , only about 250 , 000 federal employees work remotely with any regularity , officials said , of an eligible pool of about a million who could the total executive branch work force numbers about 26 million people when people realize that there might be the ability to mine some of their baseline for resources they can put back into programs , they suddenly become more interested in talking about it , mr tangherlini said through desksharing and other spacesaving measures , officials estimate they can save 55 million a year because they will not need to lease as much office space the fish and wildlife service will be able to eliminate 72 , 200 square feet of space and reduce their real estate costs by 3 million a year still , it is hard to say how long it will take before the gsa model finds its way into the darkest corners of impenetrable government bureaucracy , if ever it s a huge challenge , mr tangherlini said i'm not going to diminish the complexity and difficulty of getting people to think and act and operate in different ways
new delhi outside the sandstone palace that was built for the viceroy of britishruled india , before a crowd that included corporate titans , bollywood heartthrobs and saffronrobed hindu holy men , narendra modi , the son of a provincial teaseller , was sworn in on monday as india s prime minister in recent years , the swearingin ceremony has been a smaller and more sedate affair , but mr modi made it into a showcase for his regional ambitions , inviting his counterparts from the seven other members of the  prime minister nawaz sharif of pakistan accepted the invitation after some hesitation , and his attendance hinting that the two countries might revitalize a moribund peace process provided much of the day s solemnity after the ceremony , which was broadcast live on pakistani television channels , mr sharif strode up to mr modi and shook his hand warmly in congratulation , an image that seemed likely to eclipse the installation of the new government mr modi , after a celebratory banquet , said the two men had had a cordial exchange , raising hopes ahead of a short bilateral meeting tuesday he wrote that , in my conversation with prime minister nawaz sharif , he shared some very emotional things the pakistani premier , mr modi continued , told me that he stays in islamabad , but goes to meet his mother once in a week this time , when he was eating with his mother , he saw visuals on tv of my mother offering me sweets four thousand people were invited to monday s ceremony , and there was no shortage of pomp red carpets had been laid out on the sand outside the palace , now home to india s president , and palace guards stood at stiff attention in ornate uniforms that evoked the raj as night fell , a peacock walked the length of the palace s roof , silhouetted precisely against the sky of the capital mr modi , 63 , left his family home as a teenager , adopting the ascetic discipline of an activist for a hindu nationalist organization he has lived a solitary life since then , and among the millions of indians who watched monday s ceremony on television was his mother , hiraben , who was with a group of relatives in his home state of gujarat a brother of mr modi told ndtv , a news channel , that relatives feared their presence would cause mr modi problems we just want to make sure that no trouble should be caused to him due to us , said the brother , somabhai modi we do n't want to give a chance to anyone to allege that modi believes in nepotism thus , we have n't gone to delhi to attend the ceremony ten days had passed since mr modi s bharatiya janata party in india s general elections , garnering 282 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament it is the largest mandate ever to be won by a party other than the indian national congress , allowing the bjp to form a government without wooing any postelection allies , and has freed mr modi to take steps that would otherwise have left him vulnerable among them was his unexpected move to invite the regional leaders , a move that risked angering state leaders in india indeed , the influential chief minister of tamil nadu , jayalalithaa jayaram , boycotted the swearingin over the inclusion of president mahinda rajapaksa of sri lanka , who fought for more than two decades against rebels from his country s tamil minority but the message had come across clearly that state leaders would no longer be allowed to drive india s foreign policy mr modi spent much of this week eliminating and merging ministries , which have proliferated as previous governments tried to create positions for allies a council of 45 ministers was sworn in on monday , compared with 71 under the previous government crucial appointments , as predicted , are going to mr modi s closest aides arun jaitley is expected to head the finance ministry , and rajnath singh , the leader of the bjp , to head the ministry of home affairs here , too , is a sign that things are changing in delhi all week , reporters were waiting for word on whom mr modi would put in charge of key ministries but the leaks generally come from the allies of the governing party , and this time , there were none , even in the times of india , said ashok malik , a columnist they have no idea who his ministers are , mr malik said the country s biggest paper essentially has no idea this takes us back to the time when the prime minister was supremely powerful the swearingin was held in the open air to accommodate the larger crowd , and a high temperature of 107 degrees was recorded at midday when mr modi arrived , a ripple went through the crowd , which began chanting his name there was a large contingent of hindu holy men present , and at one point , voices in the audience could be heard calling out jai shri ram , or victory to the lord ram , a trademark shout of the rightwing hindu movement that gave mr modi his political start guests arrived in raw silk tunics , brilliantly colored turbans , heavy brocade shawls , saris intricately encrusted with pearls , widebrimmed straw boaters and wilted dress shirts prominent positions in the audience were reserved for india s largest industrialists , among them mukesh ambani , chairman of reliance industries , along with his brother and their families babu patel , a gujarati who operates a chain of hotels from niagara falls , ny , said he had spent months calling relatives in india on behalf of mr modi s campaign , and could not bear to miss monday s ceremony we want to see the change , he said we want to see our iron man of india
david wise may be the best halfpipe skier in the world he is a favorite to win a gold medal in the event s debut in sochi , russia , where it will be compared with the betterknown version performed by snowboarders like shaun white wise can explain the obvious and hidden differences between the two halfpipe disciplines one on one plank , the other on two he can speak about the physics involved in skiing backward while launching oneself off the edge of a 22foot wall of ice , rotating like a gyroscope and landing in the ideal position for the next trick what he cannot do is fully explain why he carries poles they 're kind of a fossil from early skiing days , really , wise said i still ski with poles because i skied with them my whole life , and it feels awkward not to but they 're not serving , really , any purpose other than looking cool in the air the snowboard halfpipe has been a popular event since its debut at the 1998 winter olympics in nagano , japan white helped launch it into a glamorous , donotmiss primetime event , winning the men s gold medal in the past two games and going to sochi as the favorite again skiers like wise hope to demonstrate that their version of the halfpipe , scheduled about a week after the snowboard competition , is just as worthy of wows and affection similarly , with the debut of a new event , slopestyle , for both snowboarders and skiers , viewers will be able to directly compare two ways of negotiating the same terrain the disciplines have been conducted sidebyside at events such as this weekend s x games in aspen , colo , but the olympics will provide a far bigger audience what s the difference \? which is more difficult \? which is cooler \? it can be a bit difficult to untangle while many of the top snowboarders have tried skiing , and most top skiers have strapped on a snowboard , none of them are versatile enough to excel at both and compare the differences on an olympic course one is not better than another it is a matter of taste in general , the halfpipe skiers can go higher than their snowboarding counterparts among the men , white and a few other top snowboarders can match the best skiers , popping more than 20 feet above the lip of the pipe , but more skiers can maintain their amplitude , as the sport calls it , through an entire run of five or six tricks the key to getting big air above the pipe lies in the ability to speedily traverse the bottom of the pipe having two planks allows skiers to gather their balance more quickly and carve more smoothly through the transition snowboards tend to slide , losing momentum only white and a few other snowboarders , many of them expert skateboarders , match the type of transitional speed of the skiers when you have that independent foot action and the four edges of the skis that you 're working with , your poles and whatnot , you can generate speed in different ways than you can with just one single edge , said mike jankowski , the coach of the united states olympic snowboarding and freeskiing teams you can push and pump in different ways than you can in snowboarding if you land a little bit funky on your skis , you can recover more easily and generate that speed more quickly in the air , the types of spinning , medalmaking tricks performed are similar but the ability to maintain speed and height helps top freeskiers do more of them \( the fact that they fly farther , too , means that most have room for only five hits , or tricks , while snowboarders often perform six \) that s a tough order for a snowboarder to be doing that run that david is doing , jankowski said casual viewers , like most of the millions at home watching on television , will probably not notice those nuances but they will notice that the skiers perform many of their tricks while skiing backward the skis have raised tips at both ends less obvious is that the snowboarders do the same thing but since they stand sideways on their board , their feet pointed perpendicular to its motion , going backward switch , in the vernacular looks simply like going sideways fans may not recognize that extra degree of difficulty on a snowboard , though judges do , but it is plainly seen on skis differences may be most apparent in the air aloft , snowboarders have a compact grace skiers , with two skis and two poles , look busier but the extra equipment allows them to perform crowdpleasing poses crossing their skis or their poles , spreading their legs , maybe reaching to grab different parts of the skis most of the differences apply , too , in slopestyle a long downhill course of obstacles followed by a series of large jumps the jumps in slopestyle tend to be bigger than those in the halfpipe the top men in slopestyle are likely to perform twisting triple flips , while their halfpipe counterparts will try to win with multiple doubles in their routines it seems like the snowboarders can get around the triples easier on not as a big of a jump , jankowski said of slopestyle skiers sometimes need a little bit larger of a jump , a little bit more hang time , to get everything around that they 've got going the halfpipe and slopestyle events are judged the same way , but with a different set of judges for snowboarders and for skiers there are no requirements for particular tricks or moves judges simply give scores based on overall impression for freeskiers , the overall impression that they hope to leave in sochi is that their discipline is just as impressive as the popular snowboarding events there was a reason that snowboarding got embraced the way it did it was new , it was exciting , wise said and i think that s exactly what freeskiing has to have we 've been alongside the snowboarders for a long time you guys just did n't know it the olympics did n't know but our sport has gotten to the point where it is very well polished , and when people see how well an event is run , and how heated the competition is , it s going to turn some heads
fort worth wendy davis was beaten not once but twice on election day greg abbott , her republican rival in one of the most expensive races for governor in texas' history , crushed her hopes of becoming the first democrat elected to the office in 24 years and a campaign that began with exuberant expectations ended with her failing to do even as well as the last texas democrat to lose a race for governor bill white , a former mayor of houston , who won 42 percent of the vote in 2010 , compared with ms davis s 39 percent in her defeat on tuesday the result in a year in which democrats invested tens of millions of dollars in an effort to make texas a competitive electoral landscape was a humiliating defeat that left analysts asking a simple question was it the fault of ms davis and her often rocky campaign , or was it a sign that texas is far too republican for a democrat to have a prayer \? clearly , there was some combination of the two , but everyone agreed that the problems went beyond her campaign if the democratic gubernatorial nominee in illinois , maryland and massachusetts could n't carry president obama across the finish line , how in god s name is wendy davis supposed to do it in texas \? said garry mauro , a democrat and former texas land commissioner who lost the 1998 governor s race to george w bush the demographics are there for texas to change right now , but we have n't found a leader or an issue to carry us over the threshold of being a red state wendy ran a great campaign and i love her , but she never caught the imagination of a broad spectrum of texans ms davis , who became a national figure with her against a state abortion law , had more name recognition than mr white had in 2010 she raised more money than he did and had the benefit of battleground texas , a huge field operation intended to increase democratic turnout none of it made a difference in 2010 , 21 million democrats voted for mr white on tuesday , 18 million cast ballots for ms davis republican victories for governor , lieutenant governor and other top seats left the party s dominance intact in a statement , the republican party of texas called it arguably the finest night in its modern history , as the entire republican ticket for statewide offices won by significant margins texas democrats have not won a governor s race since the november 1990 election of ann w richards , and have not won any of the nearly 30 other statewide elected offices since 1994 such history is important to understanding ms davis s loss she faced not only a wellfunded , powerful and careful republican opponent , but also an entire conservative political culture democratic leaders are trying to sound upbeat , but their collective heart , having been torn out and stomped on , is clearly not in it , said calvin jillson , a political science professor at southern methodist university in dallas democrats will not be competitive again in texas until they grow their share of the anglo vote from its recent 25 to 30 percent toward 40 percent that will be hard work , but it is work that simply must be done for democrats to be more than an afterthought in statewide elections no single factor doomed ms davis she struggled to connect with hispanic voters , but mr abbott made his own inroads by appearing in television ads and on billboards with his hispanic motherinlaw ms davis also had trouble honing a message that appealed to both her liberal base and moderate republicans some democrats believed that even if ms davis had run the perfect campaign , president obama s unpopularity set the stage for her defeat when you add the national antidemocratic mood to the equation , it means that a texas campaign can do a lot of things right and still not be able to find a foothold , said harold cook , a former executive director of the texas democratic party others said the fault was more with ms davis than with mr obama she won a total of 19 counties out of 254 , which means this was undeniably a blood bath in texas , said matt mackowiak , a republican consultant in austin wendy was seen as a proabortion candidate in a prolife state ms davis and her allies can claim some successes she raised more money 38 million than any democratic candidate for governor ever has in texas her campaign and battleground texas had nearly 34 , 000 volunteers , a state record the group planned parenthood texas votes knocked on more than 460 , 000 doors battleground texas cited an exit poll that showed that ms davis won 92 percent of africanamerican votes , up from 88 percent for mr white in 2010 but those strides only highlighted the democrats' problems if ms davis could not turn that money and getoutthevote effort into a victory , or even a close race , then who will \? someone , someday , will , democrats maintained , though they did not have much evidence to back that up ms davis s concession speech in her hometown , fort worth , made several references to enduring and winning u2 s beautiful day rang out over the loudspeakers at the end if we believe hard enough and work hard enough and push long enough , we will win this battle , ms davis said we will because as scripture tells us , the battle does not go to the swift or to the strong , but to the one who endures until the end
keene , new hampshire what is the best word to describe a crowd of more than 1 , 000 drunken college students surging through a peaceable new england town on a saturday afternoon , ripping up stop signs , jumping on cars , tipping over garbage cans , threatening passersby , and throwing billiard balls , skateboards and bottles at the police \? a riot that was the word editors at the keene sentinel , the city s daily newspaper , finally chose as they struggled to define and understand the mayhem that struck keene \( population 23 , 000 \) on oct 18 , turning a muchloved annual pumpkin festival into a national badnews story we had a discussion about it , about which words to use , said paul miller , the newspaper s executive editor and we decided it did constitute a riot because they put people at risk weirdly , keene s pumpkin festival was unaffected by the violence protected by police cordons , it was able to carry on throughout the weekend as a familyfriendly event , attracting almost 40 , 000 people , even as the drunken marauders wreaked havoc blocks away but the festival was the excuse for the parties that led to the riot for weeks , finnarage , an online party company , was sending out tweets , calling on college students across new england to come to keene state college to go wild , or to rage melanie plenda , a former sentinel reporter , tracked the trending stream of tweets in an article for the daily beast on sept 10 , finnarage was promising parties 10x crazier than last spring on oct 3 , it started the countdown to the heavy drinking 15moredays finnarage spreadtheword by oct 17 , as outoftown students were piling into parties at offcampus sites , finnarage came up with a slogan for the weekend letthekidsplay by early afternoon saturday , the kids were n't playing anymore they were on a rampage violence broke out when the police , in riot gear , moved to control the crowds by sunday , more than 80 people had been arrested , and dozens of injuries were reported on the positive side , the police never drew their guns , using sponge batons , pepper balls and tear gas instead keene s infamous bearcat , a 286 , 000 militarygrade armored truck gifted to the town by the department of homeland security , never left the garage finnarage denied any responsibility for the violence in the streets of keene our tweets were to pump up our followers who we knew were coming to our performance , not for the riots that occurred a day after our event , trevor finney , the company s founder , said in an email the outburst of rage avoided a really bad ending , but it raised some disturbing questions binge drinking on college campuses is hardly new , or news , nor is drunken , disorderly conduct but when drunken students smash up the town where they go to school or even the town where they 've come to party it signals a new and dangerous threshold in bad behavior it is a cultural shift , said mr miller , who has worked for 32 years at the paper it s as if rioting is almost a rite of passage , that college students want to be involved in unrest i do n't know why this challenge to authority , this rejection of responsibility and then , the next day , it s back to class in the days that followed , keene students did a lot of soulsearching , as well as cleaning up and apologizing interviewed on campus , several were quick to blame outsiders for much of the violence a math major worried about the negative correlation with the college s fraternities , though none were implicated these were kids who wanted to make it party time , said jennifer castine , 24 , a keene native they were out there , throwing beer bottles and shouting usa' for some reason this was n't about politics , or grievances , or even being roughed up by the police social media drew young people to keene , but it did n't egg on the violence nor was the keene riot a singular occurrence last march , in massachusetts , the police made 58 arrests during a similar episode of boozing and brawling , also promoted on social media that leaves the question of what to call these young people rebels without a cause , or spoiled brats \? partyers or hooligans \? we 've called them knuckleheads , mr miller said
cairo stealing a page from neighboring egypt , a senior army officer in libya on friday announced a military takeover , the suspension of parliament and a new road map for the future then , nothing happened prime minister ali zeidan called the supposed coup ridiculous a military spokesman called it a lie none of the libyan army s few tanks or soldiers made any visible moves the empty parliament was quiet it was the latest evidence of the long shadow cast across the region by the military takeover in cairo last summer that was announced by abdulfattah elsisi , then an army general the attempted imitation in libya , though , demonstrated the limits of the egyptian example while egypt s military ushered out president hosni mubarak three years ago and dominated the political transition , the libyan military never had much cohesion even under col muammar elqaddafi , and it had splintered long before his ouster the libyan transitional government has struggled in vain to build a national military or internal security force that might subdue fractious local militias that have sprung up across the country perhaps the most positive aspect of the libyan chaos may be a rough balance of local powers , in which no single leader or institution is strong enough to declare a coup or dictate a road map but that did not stop maj gen khalifa hifter from trying on friday he was once a senior officer under colonel qaddafi but broke with him more than two decades ago over his unsuccessful war with chad general hifter fled to exile in northern virginia and returned in 2011 to join the libyan uprising he was falsely rumored at one point to have been named to lead the rebel military offensive but he has never held a top military title like defense minister or chief of staff some reports on friday indicated he was retired , although the distinction between active and inactive military personnel is blurry in libya s loosely organized armed forces the national command of the libyan army is declaring a movement for a new road map to rescue the country , general hifter declared friday in a video posted online and sent to news outlets his speech echoed the declaration that general sisi , now field marshal sisi , made last july 3 about a new road map for egypt and like the field marshal , general hifter also pledged to hold meetings with different parties and groups regarding implementing this road map mr zeidan , who has also struggled to organize and control a government , quickly shot down the idea libya is stable , he told reuters parliament is doing its work , and so is the government , he added the army is in its headquarters , and khalifa hifter has no authority , mr zeidan said no military units have moved to touch any institutions
washington s landmark agreement with china to cut greenhouse gas pollution is a bet by the president and democrats that on the issue of , american voters are far ahead of washington s warring factions and that the environment will be a winning cause in the 2016 presidential campaign a variety of polls show that a majority of american voters now believe that climate change is occurring , are worried about it , and support candidates who back policies to stop it in particular , polls show that majorities of hispanics , young people and unmarried women the voters who were central to mr obama s victories in 2008 and 2012 support candidates who back climate change policy but republicans are betting that despite the polls , they can make the case that regulations to cut greenhouse pollution will result in the loss of jobs and hurt the economy this announcement is yet another sign that the president intends to doubledown on his jobcrushing policies no matter how devastating the impact for america s heartland and the country as a whole , said speaker john a boehner of ohio senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the soontobe majority leader , was no less critical this unrealistic plan , that the president would dump on his successor , would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs , he said in a statement mr mcconnell s remarks were a hint of a line of attack republicans are certain to use on , who is expected to run for president in 2016 the architect of mr obama s climate change plan is none other than his senior counselor , john d podesta , who is likely to leave the white house next year to work as the chairman of mrs clinton s campaign the climate plan that mr podesta has drafted for mr obama is expected to serve as a blueprint for mrs clinton s climate change policy , should she run since the deal mr obama made with china calls for the united states to cut its planetwarming carbon pollution by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 , he has effectively placed the obligation on his successor to meet that goal that dynamic sets up climate change as a potentially explosive issue on the 2016 campaign trail , which may pit mrs clinton against a field of republican candidates who question and deny the science that human activity causes global warming a number of prospective republican presidential candidates have already attacked what they say is mr obama s war on coal mr obama has muscled through his climate change agenda almost entirely with executive authority , bypassing a congress that has repeatedly refused to enact sweeping new climate change laws in addition to the agreement with china announced wednesday in beijing , mr obama has used the 1970 to issue ambitious environmental protection agency regulations intended to cut pollution from vehicle tailpipes and powerplant smokestacks mr podesta , a political veteran who was also president bill clinton s chief of staff , devised the 2025 targets to ensure that they could be reached without new action from a future congress abandoning them would require the next president to overturn them from the republican point of view , a democratic candidate who might instead issue still more environmental regulations would be a ripe target for 2016 they 're giving republicans fertile ground for attack , said mike murphy , a longtime republican strategist overregulation is clearly a job killer and jobs and the economy and middleclass wages are going to be a huge issue in the 2016 presidential and it does seem like an inside job , with podesta setting up hillary s position politically , they 're going to put themselves in a weak position on this as evidence , republican strategists point to their recent wave of victories in this year s midterm elections , when they campaigned aggressively against mr obama s epa regulations but democrats are increasingly emboldened by polls showing that in national elections , candidates who push climate change policies will win support from voters according to a 2013 poll by stanford university , 73 percent of americans believe that the earth has been warming over the past 100 years , while 81 percent of americans think global warming poses a serious problem in the united states in addition , 81 percent think the federal government should limit the amount of greenhouse gases that american businesses can emit twentyone percent of americans think producing electricity from coal is a good idea , while 91 percent of americans think making electricity from sunlight is a good idea a 2014 poll by the yale project on climate change communication , meanwhile , found that majorities of women , minorities and young people support candidates who strongly endorse climate action that poll found that 65 percent of hispanics , 53 percent of blacks and 53 percent of unmarried women support candidates who back climate change action it found that 44 percent of people in their 20s favor candidates who support climate change action , compared with 17 percent who oppose climate action these groups were hugely important in the 2008 and 2012 elections , said anthony a leiserowitz , the director of the yale project and they will be more important in 2016 , because they are starting to make up a greater portion of the electorate mrs clinton has not laid out a specific climate change policy that she might pursue as president , but she has enthusiastically supported efforts to reduce carbon pollution including mr obama s regulations at a september conference on clean energy in nevada she called climate change the most consequential , urgent , sweeping collection of challenges we face as a nation and a world , and said that mr obama s epa regulations put the united states in a strong position in international negotiations democrats also believe that wednesday s announcement weakens at least one crucial republican argument against climate action for years , republicans have argued that the united states should not take unilateral action on climate change because it would hamstring the economy while china , the world s largest carbon polluter , failed to act but the agreement with china undercuts that argument for republicans , the issue of climate change , like immigration and , is one that potential candidates and their advisers are starting to grapple with as they try to carve a path to the presidency , while winning support from a new generation of more diverse voters republicans who seek to win their presidential nomination will have to win support from their conservative base white and older voters , who , polls show , are less likely to believe that climate change is a problem more important , republicans do not want to be targeted by conservative outside groups like americans for prosperity , the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires charles and david koch tim phillips , the president of americans for prosperity , has said that his group intends to aggressively attack any republican candidate in the 2016 primaries who endorses carbon regulations but some republican strategists worry that the position on climate change that could help win them their party s nomination could hurt them in a general election , particularly in a contest with a larger number of young and minority voters
the martha graham enterprise is growing quainter and quainter , though heaven knows it remains earnest on wednesday the company graham founded almost 88 years ago began its season at city center with a gala celebrating the connection between her and greece three groups of dancers performed the main graham troupe , the graham 2 junior company and the hellenic dance company \( visiting from greece \) all the performers were admirable the evening s biggest applause went to panorama , jointly performed by graham 2 and the hellenic visitors , all pounding the ground and contracting in midair yet none of this hard work made for one real dance worth watching as choreography though the greek mythological dances of graham principally made between 1946 and 1963 brought her career to its greatest celebrity , they mainly seem thinner in dance terms than the works she had already made it s since graham s own retirement from dancing in 1970 that decline has been a recurrent issue when i began to watch the graham company in the 1970s , all her new choreography was fairly terrible , and the older pieces had become only intermittently effective she died in 1991 the company today is directed by janet eilber , who was probably the finest of the graham dancers i watched in the 1970s but while there have been moments in recent years when freshness returned to parts of night journey \( 1947 \) and clytemnestra \( 1958 \) , the repertory has come to look largely like a ghost town i do n't blame ms eilber for this graham s dances began to look dated long before she died the wonder has been those occasional moments of reillumination the damage inflicted in 2012 on company property by hurricane sandy was just part of a much longerterm process of erosion wednesday s gala began with two hammy chunks from clytemnestra they looked fairly absurd out of context since most of graham s dramas are on the cusp of absurdity anyway , they need a rare blaze to redeem them now katherine crockett failed to ignite the in which the title character relishes the ax she will use to commit mariticide one choral number featured precisely the heavy , repeated wristtobrow gestures that merce cunningham made look ludicrous , on purpose , in antic meet \( choreographed and last shown in new york in 2011 \) the loud applause for panorama \( 1935 \) was to hail its 35 young dancers , who , in three main groups , jumped , flexed and tilted with impressive choral force despite their devotions , the work itself looks like a thoroughly bygone piece of 1930s modernism the dancers maintained sculptural tension throughout and moved with an unwavering dynamic urgency that soon grew monotonous all manner of modern choreographers have visited graham s company since she died they have n't solved the ghosttown problem , and sometimes they have made it worse wednesday brought the world premiere of echo , by the greek choreographer andonis foniadakis it treats the myth of narcissus , of the love he has for his reflection , as a mildly homosexual malemale duet \( lloyd mayor and lorenzo pagano \) , with echo \( peiju chienpott \) every so often making a nosyneighbor appearance only to realize , and then realize again , that she s in the way every time she departs , the mutual infatuation of the two guys reaches a new peak seven other dancers make appearances to amplify the relationships in choral terms everything was harmless and forgettable , though the dancers performed with a naturalness that s inappropriate to the strenuous high solemnity of their graham heritage the worst aspects of the evening were its three scores halim eldabh s for clytemnestra , norman lloyd s for panorama and julien tarride s for echo , all played here on tape few of graham s own works were set to music worth listening to in its own right \( aaron copland s appalachian spring is the chief exception \) and it s in these shoddy soundtracks that so much of the quaintness of today s graham troupe lies
paris before the french open began , stan wawrinka was asked how different it was to enter a major after winning one , as he did at the australian open in january he joked about having to do more interviews but a perk of his new status was a bigger stage so the thirdseeded wawrinka found himself opening his tournament on philippe chatrier court , the main stadium at roland garros , while the top seed and defending champion , rafael nadal , played on the smaller suzanne lenglen court here is the thing about bigger stages there is farther to fall wawrinka tumbled out of the french open on monday , losing to guillermo garc al pez of spain , 64 , 57 , 62 , 60 wawrinka is the first australian open winner to lose in the first round of the subsequent french open since petr korda in 1998 but it has been even longer since a man won both tournaments in one year \( jim courier , 1992 \) , and the draw did not help wawrinka in that quest garc al pez , 30 , is ranked no 41 and had a strong spring on clay , winning in casablanca last month and reaching the quarterfinals in monte carlo by beating no 6 tomas berdych still , garc al pez , whose role model is his fellow spaniard david ferrer , had not advanced past the first round at roland garros since 2011 , and wawrinka , 29 , is no slouch on clay he earned his first masters 1000 title in monte carlo in april , defeating three top10 players on friday he said he was happy , confident and prepared for the french open , despite early exits from events in madrid and rome an earlier elimination in monday s raininterrupted action was that of ninthseeded kei nishikori , who lost to no 59 martin klizan , 76 \( 4 \) , 61 , 62 but that may not have been much of an upset , all things considered nishikori , 24 , had been struggling with a back injury for most of this month in his young career , great disappointment has never been far behind great triumph under the tutelage of michael chang this season , nishikori became the first japanese man to break into the top 10 this spring on clay , he won the tournament in barcelona and reached the final at the masters 1000 event in madrid , going up a set and a break on rafael nadal but nishikori retired from that match in the third set because of his back , and he did not play the next event in rome because of the injury nishikori beat roger federer in the quarterfinals of the masters 1000 event in miami in march , but he withdrew from his semifinal against novak djokovic because of a groin injury it s tough for me , but i guess this is my tennis life , you know , nishikori said i have to take care of my body , and injury will come again , for sure so i have to mentally , you know , be ready after battling through a first set that took nearly an hour on monday , nishikori faded , losing the first five games of the second set his serve was hampered throughout , which he attributed to a lack of practice since the madrid tournament he had 10 double faults and put in only half of his first serves first time playing points after madrid , so i did n't have much rhythm , he said the same was true of wawrinka , playing in a 15 , 000seat stadium that was half empty he seemed to get back into the match by winning the second set , but he was immediately broken to start the third and later called that letup stupid i was trying to find my game , trying to be aggressive , trying to find anything , and i did n't , wawrinka said he added i think i was completely flat i was not really relaxed with my game knowing darkness was approaching , and not wanting to give wawrinka an overnight reprieve , garc al pez said he started playing faster , sensing wawrinka was not so strong mentally garc al pez was not the only one racing the elements maria sharapova , the no 7 seed , opened play on chatrier and made quick work of her opponent , ksenia pervak , winning by 61 , 62 in 61 minutes no 12 flavia pennetta also finished in 61 minutes no 18 eugenie bouchard , a semifinalist at the australian open , was done in 59 no 19 samantha stosur and no 20 alize cornet , the highestranked frenchwomen , were even quicker , winning in 58 minutes facundo bagnis and julien benneteau took their time completing their match , with bagnis winning his grand slam debut , 61 , 62 , 16 , 36 , 1816 , in 4 hours 27 minutes the weather also had nadal , the eighttime french open champion , worried about time , not his court assignment , which caused some consternation among observers he said it did not matter if it s chatrier or lenglen or another court but the assignment had surprised his opponent , robby ginepri , who woke early sunday to practice on chatrier at 8 am nadal said he thought he would not play monday , adding that the waiting had left him tired mentally even so , ginepri did not win a game until 37 minutes into the match , and nadal rolled , 60 , 63 , 60 by early evening , no 17 roberta vinci also fell , 36 , 63 , 62 , to pauline parmentier , a 28yearold from france who had not advanced past the first round of her home grand slam event in seven years vasek pospisil , the no 30 seed in the men s draw , lost to teymuraz gabashvili , 64 , 62 , 63 but as darkness came , none had fallen as hard as wawrinka he said he expected more from himself now , because he knew how well he was capable of playing now it s a different picture for my career , wawrinka said i need to put the puzzle back together , but differently than in the past , because now , after winning grand slam , masters 1000 , being no 3 in the world , everything is different , and i still did n't find all the pieces
el pericon , mexico the blur of scientific talk from the investigators washed over him something about a bone fragment , dna testing , probability as he sat dazed in an abandoned classroom at the teachers college his son attended but ezequiel mora who , like other parents of the college s missing students , had been waiting weeks for word of their children wanted to know only one thing was his son alexander , a 19yearold who had sought escape from the farming life to become a teacher , dead or not \? i stopped them and asked them to give it to me straight , he said sunday at his home here , referring to his meeting late friday with argentine forensics experts working with on the case of 43 students missing since september then they told me it was my son , and that he was dead he added they punched me in the heart i wanted to scream he asked for and received a shot of mezcal for comfort the news that the first of the students had been confirmed as dead rocked not only mr mora but much of mexico , where many have been consumed by the fates of the students and , in march after march , demanding that the government end the country s widespread lawlessness and corruption now , it seems highly likely that the other missing students are dead , too on sunday , attorney general jes s murillo karam confirmed that a laboratory in austria had matched a bone fragment found among charred remains to alexander mora s dna the result provides strong evidence for the theory that the students were killed and burned to ashes witnesses have told investigators that the local police abducted the students and turned them over to a gang on behalf of a corrupt mayor in conflict with them mr murillo karam said 80 people had been arrested in the case so far and that 16 more were being sought president enrique pe a nieto , who is suffering the worst crisis in his twoyear term , has promised justice and unveiled a series of changes that would disband most municipal police forces and place them under the control of the states but here in alexander s hometown , one that has wrestled greatly with crime , people lashed out at a government they viewed as corrupt and inept while mourning a young man , who like many classmates , saw the teachers college as the only viable way to get ahead he studied at another university for a short time , with the idea of becoming a lawyer , but settled on teaching as many as eight other missing students come from this region of guerrero state , one of the poorest and most violent in mexico for many boys aspiring to lives away from the fields of squash and jicama , the teachers college in ayotzinapa , about an hour s drive from acapulco , provides one of the more viable alternatives alexander had just started there a few months before he was abducted with other students in a confrontation with the police in iguala the students had sought to steal buses for a coming demonstration , a common practice mr mora last spoke to his son on sept 16 , when alexander came home to celebrate mexican independence day , but they talked on the phone a few times after that , as alexander requested money for meals in this dusty town of 2 , 000 , neighbors and family members , several weeping , streamed into the small , twobedroom cinderblock house as mr mora built an altar in the living room with flowers and pictures of alexander mr mora patiently greeted them for hours , but at one point retreated to a back room , where he could be heard sobbing you have to be strong , for the rest of those poor students , a woman said as she consoled him you ca n't give up now something has to change mr mora said he had nothing but contempt for the country s leaders and did not know what to believe about the apparent motive for the killings he noted bitterly that none of the country s leaders had called him to express condolences government lies that is all they do , he said they never give us complete answers about investigations , about missing people or murders even in this remote town , a wave of kidnappings and street crime prompted people to set up their own community police force , with grudging recognition from the state authorities overwhelmed with grief , mr mora said he accepted the findings of the dna test because they were supported by a team of argentine forensic investigators working with the government at the request of human rights officials mourners here recalled alexander as a quiet , polite youth who loved sports , especially soccer , which he played every afternoon his mother died five years ago of diabetes , leaving mr mora to raise him and seven other children alexander s respectful manner attracted girls , said family members and friends he was the only one of my older brothers that used to give me advice , instead of scolding me , his sister saena said he was like a friend , not just a brother his girlfriends used to tell me , what a gentleman' alexander joked about his charm , she said , once saying , i might be ugly , but it s my personality that wins them over mr mora said he had barely slept and barely cried , too overwhelmed with the news and visits still , family members said they were taking comfort from the community , with several residents squeezing into mr mora s home on sunday evening for a prayer vigil maybe because i have n't been able to cry all that much i have this terrible headache , he said he was told he would receive the remains in a couple of weeks i just want to wait for his little bones , he said i just hoped they would have killed him and left the body somewhere along a road for someone to find him and bring him to me , he said that way you can find some kind of comfort

the election this fall will most certainly return to power the most despised congress in the modern era , if not ever the house , already a graveyard for common sense , will fall further under the control of politicians whose idea of legislating is to stage a hearing for fox news the senate , padlocked by filibusters over everyday business , will be more of the same , with one party in nominal control the fastestgrowing , most openminded and leastpartisan group of voters will have no say that s right the independents , on this independence day , have never been more numerous but they 've never been more shut out of power earlier this year , that 42 percent of americans identified as independents , the highest it has measured since modern polling techniques started 25 years ago that survey found that republicans destined to keep control of the house and possibly take the senate comprise only one in four americans , their lowest share over that same quartercentury span democrats were at 31 percent the breakdown is even more unrepresentative when you look at the millennial generation , which , by most definitions , is the largest ever , with about 80 million people these are the baby boomers' kids , who bring their lifeasabuffet view to voting as well they like choice in music , food , lifestyle , religion and politics half of all americans under the age of 34 describe themselves as politically independent , earlier this year , a highwater mark this generation is also near the highest levels 29 percent to say they are not affiliated with any religion and if you consider california , our most populous state and long a trendsetter for values and politics , the same picture emerges there , the latest tally of registered voters shows that the fastestgrowing segment is the category of no party while the number of these independent voters in california grew by 50 , 000 people this year , the republicans lost almost 37 , 000 democrats were basically flat , with a loss of 3 , 000 the pattern , nearly everywhere but in the states of the old confederacy , is the same people are leaving the republican party , and to a lesser extent the democrats , to jump in the nonpartisan lane the independents are more likely to want something done about climate change , and immigration reform they 're not afraid of gay marriage or contraception or sensible gun laws they think government can be a force for good and none of those sentiments are represented by the current majority in the people s house the senate , at least , has two independents , both of whom caucus with the democrats in the house \? zero remember that the next time speaker john boehner says that his members are doing the work of the american people they 're doing fox s work , which is why they 've had endless hearings on benghazi , and voted more than 50 times to take away people s health care , but wo n't allow a vote on the minimum wage or immigration reform if you thought that the last election in which 12 million more votes were cast for a democratic member of the house , but the republicans kept control by a healthy margin was unrepresentative , the coming contest will set a new standard for mismatch between the voters' will and the people who represent them only 12 percent of the general public is defined as steadfast conservative , in the latest done by pew but that rises to 19 percent for the politically engaged thus the tea party , though disliked by most americans , can win elections in red states , and send people to washington who will govern only for the narrow , passionate base that elected them when you examine the beliefs of independents , particularly among millennials , they lean democratic that is , most policy issues pushed by the democrats get majority support from the nonpartisans combining all the categories , pew put the prodemocratic cohort at 55 percent , the prorepublican at 36 percent but the two party brands are so soiled now by the current donothing congress and their screaming advocates that voters prefer not to have anything to do with either of them the indies still vote they went for barack obama , twice , but hate partisanship they 've soured on obama for not fulfilling his great promise of forging a coalition that is neither red nor blue what to do \? first , recognize the imbalance any democracy is broken when a plurality is not represented in the halls of power the november contest for control of congress ca n't possibly be a wave election , as many politicos will claim , because a nearmajority has no slate of candidates second , get a slate of candidates some states now allow no party politicians a prominent place on the ballot , so long as they finish in the top ranks in the age of crowdsourcing , raising the kind of money to fight , say , a koch brothersbacked republican is not all that difficult third , do n't check out the emerging majority is the most racially diverse , politically openminded , socialmediaengaged generation in history they 're repulsed by the partisan hacks , and the lobbyistindustrial complex that controls them you see their influence in everything but the governing institutions in washington it s about time that voice is heard
london with the of its decision to award new shale drilling licenses in 2014 , the british government has made plain its enthusiasm for shale gas this zeal stems from the belief that an increased domestic gas supply will drive down national prices , at once enhancing export competitiveness while addressing growing public concern over rising domestic energy bills but this strategy is misguided unlike in the united states , a shale gas revolution will not bring down prices in britain in britain , proponents of increased drilling , including prime minister david cameron , like to point to the success of expanded shale gas production in america there , the ability to tap into vast resources of shale gas , thanks to developments in a technology called hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , has led to a significant drop in domestic gas prices , created tens of thousands of jobs and helped to move the united states away from dependence on gas imports but america s shale gas revolution , which was over 25 years in the making , occurred in a context that would be very difficult to replicate in today s britain a number of specific conditions helped to drive the american shale gas revolution , not least favorable geology much of america s shale yields high levels of very valuable liquids , like crude oil , as well as gas the ability to extract these liquids , produced as a byproduct of shale gas operations , has tended to make the economics of american shale operations favorable despite low domestic gas prices the geological knowhow underpinning the success of drilling in the united states was the product of governmentfunded research dating as far back as the 1980s , the results of which were widely disseminated to private industry \( this sort of research would not and should not be funded by private companies , as fundamental science cannot be patented \) extensive tax breaks for shale operations were allotted early on in the game , and environmental regulations were relatively weak capital markets were willing to provide risk finance for oil and gas operations , and the industry was dominated by a network of small , entrepreneurial companies , supported by a dynamic and highly competitive service sector finally , property rights in the united states make any extracted shale gas the property of the landowner , incentivizing private owners to tolerate the disruptions caused by shale operations virtually none of these characteristics are present in britain the british government is ideologically reluctant to fund basic scientific research environmental regulations are extremely strict , and public opposition to fracking is vehement capital markets are not accustomed to funding highrisk petroleum exploration activities , and the onshore service industry is woefully undeveloped compared with its american counterparts the vesting of british oil and gas rights in the state , instead of with the private landowner , discourages individuals from supporting new drilling operations moreover , without major government intervention in the domestic gas market , greater shale gas production will simply enable the big british companies to send more gas through the interconnector pipeline to belgium , taking advantage of higher prices on the continent they would not leave money on the table for british consumers although britain does appear to have significant technically recoverable resources of shale gas , a revolution along american lines is therefore unlikely greater emphasis on shale may still generate revenue and make britain more energysecure , but only if the british government implements strategic policy measures tax breaks could be offered to communities that host shale gas wells \( indeed , breaks along these lines have recently been proposed , with payouts of 100 , 000 pounds , or about 162 , 000 , for each hydrofractured well , plus one percent of the revenues from each well but the specifics remain unclear \) incentives could also be implemented to spur the development of a service industry that could eventually become a major earner , exporting its services to a europe hungry for shale gas operations most crucially , in a country where communities are being mobilized to actively resist the presence of shale gas operations , the british government must make a concerted effort to address public concerns among these is the fact that current shale gas activities are subject to a plethora of regulations , and monitored by multiple , often obscure , authorities the establishment of a designated administrative body for shale gas operations , armed with a single set of production guidelines , might go some way to assuaging community fears there are legitimate environmental concerns , and these will have to be weighed against any benefits of increased shale gas production many fear that a greater emphasis on shale will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions , a byproduct of methane emissions and burning larger volumes of natural gas groundwater pollution and waste are real risks also significant is the argument that a ramping up of shale gas operations would come at the expense of needed investments in renewable energies like wind and solar to the extent that it may reduce britain s dependence on gas imports , shale gas has the potential to make the country more energy secure and it may also generate some muchwelcomed revenue but even if the public relations campaign can be won , the british government is ultimately likely to be disappointed because a shift to shale will not bring down domestic gas prices

las vegas on the first day of the fall semester , i left campus from an afternoon of teaching anxious college freshmen and headed to my second job , serving at a chain restaurant off las vegas boulevard the switch from my professional attire to a white dress shirt , black apron and tie reflected the separation i attempt to maintain between my two jobs naturally , sitting at the first table in my section was one of my new students , dining with her parents this scene is a clich of the struggling teacher , and it surfaces repeatedly in pop culture think of walter white in breaking bad , washing the wheels of a student s sports car after a full day teaching high school chemistry bumping into a student at the gym can be awkward , but exposing the reality that i , with my master s degree , not only have another job , but must have one , risks destroying the facade of success i present to my students as one of their university mentors in class i emphasize the value of a degree as a means to avoid the sort of jobs that i myself go to when those hours in the classroom are over a colleague in my department labeled these jobs \( food and beverage , retail and customer service the only legal work in abundance in las vegas \) as survival jobs he tells our students they need to learn that survival work will not grant them the economic security of whitecollar careers i never told him that i myself had such a job , that i needed our meeting to end within the next 10 minutes or i 'd be late to a sevenhour shift serving drunk , needy tourists , worsening my premature back problem while getting hit on repeatedly the line between these two worlds is thinner here in las vegas than it might be elsewhere the majority of my students this semester hold parttime survival jobs , and some of them will remain in those jobs for the rest of their working lives about 60 percent of the college freshmen i teach will not finish their degree they will turn 21 and then forgo a bachelor s degree for the instant gratification of a cashbased income , whether parking cars in vegas hotels , serving in highend restaurants or dealing cards in the casinos in a city like las vegas , many customerservice jobs generate far more cash \( with fewer work hours \) than entrylevel , officedwelling , degreerequiring jobs it can be hard to convince my 19yearold students that the latter is more profitable or of greater personal value my adjunctteaching colleagues have large course loads and , mostly , graduatelevel educations , but live just above the poverty line in contrast , my parttime work in the vegas service industry has produced three times more income than my university teaching \( i 've passed up the health benefits that come with fulltime teaching , a luxury foreign to the majority of adjuncts at other universities , to make time for my bluecollar work \) indeed , for a young academic like myself , the job market is bleak i'm pursuing advanced degrees and a career in the academy despite the lack of employment prospects , because my first and true love is learning however , it will take earning a doctorate and thus several more years of work before i can earn a sustainable income in my chosen pursuit living these two supposedly different lives , i 've started to see their similarities whenever i'm trying to meet the needs of my more difficult guests \( do you have any smaller forks \? you do n't carry wheat bread \? what kind of restaurant does n't carry wheat bread \? \) , i recite , along with my colleagues , the collective restaurant server mantra i need a real job the same thought gets passed among adjuncts in my department i need a real teaching position i need to publish a book i know this path takes time , and i'm trying to do it right so why do i still experience a great feeling of shame when clearing a student s dirty plate \? embarrassment is not an adequate term to describe what i felt when those parents looked at me , clearly stupefied , thinking , this waitress teaches my child \? it is a shame i share with many of my bluecollar colleagues , a belief that society deems our work inferior , that we have settled on or chosen these paths because we do not have the skills necessary to acquire something better it is certainly a belief i held for the majority of my undergraduate experience but not all my restaurant coworkers are college dropouts , and none are failures many have bachelor s degrees others have real estate licenses , freelancing projects or extraordinary musical and artistic abilities others are nontraditional students , having entered the work force before attending college and making the wise decision not to find themselves and come out with 40 , 000 in debt , at 46 percent interest most of them are parents who have bought homes , raised children and made financial investments off their modest incomes they are some of the kindest , hardestworking people i know , and after three years alongside them , i find it difficult to tell my students to avoid being like them my perhaps na ve hope is that when i tell students i'm not only an academic , but a survival jobholder , i 'll make a dent in the artificial , inaccurate division society places between bluecollar work and intelligent work we expect our teachers to teach us , not our servers , although in the current economy , these might be the same people if my students can imagine the possibility that choosing to work with their hands does not automatically exclude them from being people who critically examine the world around them , i will feel i 've done something worthwhile , not only for those who will earn their degree , but for the majority who will not
melbourne , fla the over allegations that had molested or assaulted several women , in some cases years ago , was almost nowhere in evidence on friday night during a soldout performance by the 77yearold comedian on a college campus here despite exhortations by a local radio station and an offer of money to anyone who had the nerve no one stood up during mr cosby s 90minute appearance on the campus of eastern florida state college to demand an explanation from him about the women s accusations , something he has studiously avoided doing since the controversy arose instead , mr cosby who did not address the issues from the stage was greeted with a standing ovation and sent offstage with a second one at the end of his show outside the theater , however , three protesters held signs criticizing victim shaming , while another sign said , rape is no joke the protesters were kept more than 2 00 yards from the theater and next to a main road , on orders from the police earlier on friday , three women renita chaney hill , angela leslie and kristina ruehli were to publicly detail their experiences with mr cosby , all telling similar stories of being given drugs or alcohol before being sexually assaulted and in an interview on wptv in west palm beach , fla , another woman , therese serignese , 57 , a registered nurse , has accused mr cosby of drugging and having sex with her after one of his shows at the las vegas hilton in 1976 when she was 19 mr cosby s lawyers have routinely characterized such allegations as unfounded amid the drumbeat of accusations , nbc on wednesday said it was canceling a cosby pilot project , and the cable network tv land quietly stopped showing repeats of the cosby show less than 24 hours earlier , netflix said it was postponing the debut of a comedy special other scheduled appearances by mr cosby on david letterman s latenight show and queen latifah s daytime talk show have also been canceled in addition , two more shows on mr cosby s standup comedy tour were canceled one at the treasure island hotel and casino in las vegas and another at the virginia theater in champaign , ill more than 30 performances remain on a schedule that runs well into next spring campus officials here had braced themselves for trouble by midafternoon , four police cars were parked at the entrance to the 2 , 016seat maxwell c king center for the performing arts , and members of the audience were advised before mr cosby took the stage that there may be attempts to disrupt tonight s performance if a disruption occurs , the announcer went on , please keep calm and do not confront the person making the disruption none occurred , and the comedian , seated for most of the show , calmly proceeded through a jovial routine that hewed closely to themes of family foibles mr cosby broke his silence on the matter i friday with the newspaper florida today , saying that a radio station s offers of cash and prizes to interrupt his performance had merely fostered a frat house mentality now suppose someone brings a weapon or decided to do more foolishness , mr cosby said i know people are tired of me not saying anything , but a guy does n't have to answer to innuendos , he told florida today people should fact check people should n't have to go through that and should n't answer to innuendos audience members here were almost uniformly supportive of the veteran comedian , although officials at the theater said some ticket holders they would not divulge the number had demanded refunds there appeared to be at least two dozen empty seats in the auditorium in interviews before the performance , the overriding theme of the comments was that nothing had been proved against mr cosby and that the women who had come forward must be doing so solely for financial gain i bet if he gave every one of them 2 million , they 'd never say a word again , marc linden , a 65yearold former elementary schoolteacher , said as he took photographs of the television satellite trucks on post road they just want the money if all this was true , these women would have come out a long time ago a lawyer for mr cosby , martin singer , told the entertainment trade paper recently that the women s claims were fabricated or unsubstantiated the demonstrators here , however , saw it differently the backlash against these women who have come forward has really bothered me , said tamara allredge , a 46yearold hairdresser from orlando who previously worked as a counselor to rape victims i believe in innocent until proven guilty , but it goes both ways these women are brave they have a right to be listened to
a few years back , peter gelb , in one of his most daft and delightful strokes as general manager of the metropolitan opera , hatched the notion of creating a fullscale baroquestyle pastiche opera , scavenging arias and instrumental numbers from a variety of baroque sources the resulting odd beast of a work devised and written \( the met s words \) by and ever so loosely based on shakespeare s the tempest and a midsummer night s dream stirred considerable curiosity adding to the frisson , it was to be performed by a starry cast on , thus promising sparkle and gaiety and it delivered but as with many curiosities , its luster seems to have faded quickly , to judge from the meager audience for the first performance of a revival of phelim mcdermott s production , on wednesday evening this despite in the work , offering some of the same stars and others , and substituting several arias , the better to suit them , in good , freewheeling baroque fashion it s too bad the house was n't fuller it was a most entertaining evening , with some superlative singing , though not from all of the usual suspects anyone who saw the production in its original run will undoubtedly recall the great pl cido domingo as neptune , presiding over his undersea realm \( in a brilliant watery rendering by the set designer , julian crouch \) , greeted at his entry as neptune the great to the strains of handel s zadok the priest a stunning scene mr domingo is back in the production , but with a handel aria in a later scene replacing one by rameau who can remember , in such a hodgepodge , which aria was better \? what was decidedly not better on wednesday was mr domingo s singing though a wonder for his longevity , mr domingo , well into his 70s , did not add to his glory on this occasion , with the occasional longheld ringing high note apart mostly gruff tone quality and his always quirky sung english was at its worst still , he was hailed by the audience as the conquering hero that he has long been along with the spectacle , act i consists largely of scenesetting and scenestealing the master at the stealing part , luca pisaroni , did his usual best , both vocally and theatrically , as the monstrous caliban danielle de niese , as ariel , went a bit over the top in her hamminess and pastedon charm but the real stars of the show david daniels as prospero , the exiled duke of milan and susan graham as the sorceress sycorax , prospero s former lover \( in this presentation \) and caliban s mother came into their own in act ii , each with meltingly poignant , exquisite numbers of love , loss or regret there were also excellent smaller turns by andriana chuchman as miranda , prospero s daughter , and anthony roth costanzo as ferdinand , destined to marry miranda patrick summers conducted a sometimes loose performance , with occasional slippages in ensemble between orchestral sections or between pit and stage nor was the playing itself particularly distinguished , though those of us who fancy periodinstrument performances of baroque music tend to look for a quicksilver pliancy that is harder to achieve on modern instruments in any case , none of this detracted greatly from a wonderful evening of music and drama but alas , without bigger audiences , the show may not survive beyond this run
recaps are all about spoilers , so if you haven t seen the finale yet , you shouldn t be here , especially since i will begin with the biggest at the top stop reading if you don t want to know anything the finale of season 2 , the echo , finally answered the question who killed emmet and leanne \? with a surprise answer their son , jared the very person for whom elizabeth and philip wished to avenge their death and not only did jared murder his parents \( and sister \) , he also murdered them because they were trying to protect him from joining the center s second generation illegals program they were trying to keep him out of danger , and in the end he was the most ruthless one of all it s brilliant , in retrospect , that we met jared at a carnival , where things are not what they seem , and where funhouse mirrors distort expectations i honestly didn t start suspecting jared until he and elizabeth were alone in the woods , just before the murderous american operative larrick who was always assumed to be the killer appeared it was such a great whodunit that i forgave jared s implausible demise he made his entire lengthy confession gurgling through a mouthful of blood but somehow managed to get the story out , in a perfect arc , before he expired jared shocker aside , season 2 really turned out to be the season of paige remember back in episode 1 , when paige was just kind of a little kid \? \( back then , jared was little more than an extra to us \) by episode 3 , paige was suspicious enough of her parents to take a bus all the way to harrisburg , pa , to meet the creepy aunt helen those suspicions then blossomed into fullfledged , sardonic mistrust she sure sneaked up on us , innocent little paige , with her bangs , her sweet plaintive eyes , her down vests that said , paige herself for the time being is a relative innocent season 2 ends on the question of her fate elizabeth and philip learn in the episode s final moments that the center is now targeting paige for the same program they wanted jared to join throughout a season of great writing and storytelling , the show planted the seeds of paige s fate her story began as a main focus of the plot , then moved to the sidelines and back into the center again , but it was never quite clear how everything especially her religion kick was going to come together up until the moment when the spy supervisor claudia spelled it out , we might have guessed something was coming , but we probably would not have guessed what what a great scene that was claudia , who has had a rocky relationship with elizabeth and philip , appeared from behind a stone pillar , as if out of midair , after disappearing at the end of episode 6 philip and elizabeth shared a look of disbelief , and then claudia , speaking in the sort of reasonable tones that suggested she had emerged as an ally , told them about the center s plan to recruit jared , which emmet and leanne had fought she made it clear that none of this was her plan i want you to know i had nothing to do with this , she said i did not know about it i would have fought it elizabeth responded , i believe you , and it seemed that this particular hatchet had finally been buried but within seconds , claudia suddenly turned enemy again , that very same woman elizabeth has never it seems now , with reason been able to trust the center they want paige to be next , claudia said there was a pause as viewers shared in philip and elizabeth s shock and horror that is not an option , philip said those are your orders , claudia said , not mincing any words at that point first , soon , you need to tell her who you really are , who she really is get her ready then develop her until the time the time is right for you to tell her that she will join our ranks she then went on about how it was unforgivable of the center to go behind emmett and leanne s back , but she had already said this was an order , not a request so you hoped that philip and elizabeth had enjoyed the few moments when they thought claudia was fully on their side , before she informed them that paige belongs to the cause , and to the world and added , we all do you haven t forgotten that , have you \? the ninastan story wasn t as gasp inducing as the jared reveal or the paigemightbecomeaspy stuff , but it was still pretty good maybe you just don t know me as well as you think , stan told his wife , sandra , when she correctly guessed that there was something going on with him other than their separation i guess maybe i didn t know him as well either , because it was my sense that he was too far gone on nina to betray her , and boy , was i wrong that typewritten note tell nina i m sorry was a little terse the early 80s equivalent of being dumped by text message considering what they d been through together , if getting dumped also regularly entailed being shipped back to an oppressive nation , tried for treason and possibly executed was that the end of nina \? was that sad accusing forlorn look out of the back window of that car the last we , or stan , will ever see of her \? so far , other than seeing vaklonov in his prisonlike environs , we haven t spent a lot of time in the soviet union but it s not unthinkable that if they can redraw the emotional perimeters of the show to include the possibility of paige as an agent , it is possible to redraw the geographical ones to include the soviet union as a location \( when brooklyn isn t posing as washington \) also , everyone loves the actress playing nina , annet mahendru there are reasons they ll try to keep her around there is no doubt we ll see philip and elizabeth we have been with them through infidelities , wigs , car chases and murders , and , despite their flaws and body count the episode began with the two of them letting fred timbrook bleed to death in a phone booth we understand them and perhaps even identify with their struggle to raise a family in difficult circumstances \( even though , you hope , our struggles are less dramatic \) so we also worry about paige s becoming an agent , and we certainly applaud when philip approaches the rezidentura director , arkady , at a newsstand and says , if our organization ever gets anywhere near our daughter without our permission , my wife and i are finished but there is the bigger , darker question that philip and elizabeth must ask it would destroy her , philip says of the kgb s plan to be like us \? counters elizabeth elizabeth and philip have been undyingly loyal to the soviet union , to the cause but what happens when that cause , which promises freedom , tries to enslave them or their children \? do they see the paradox when paige announced that she was inspired by jesus , who sacrificed himself for the greater good \? just as jared declared that the soviet spies work for something greater than themselves \? \( the episode is called the echo , after all \) we ll know more in 2015 when the americans comes back for season 3 who suspected jared \? be honest do you think that s it for nina \? who thinks paige would make a great kgb agent \?

seattle derek jeter played his first major league game just a few hundred yards outside the walls of safeco field , in the long since demolished kingdome since that first game may 29 , 1995 nothing much has changed as jeter , the yankee captain , plays his final season , he carries the same approach he had two decades ago he takes responsibility , then and now i 've always felt that way , jeter said before the ' 32 victory against the on tuesday night i 've always felt as though anytime you step onto the field you have to do a lot of the little things and a lot of little things is my job jeter helped the yankees get on the board early with a oneout single to center in the first off the mariners righthander hisashi iwakuma and scored two batters later on a double by carlos beltran with the game tied in the eighth , jeter drilled a oneout double deep to left and scored the decisive run on jacoby ellsbury s single those are winning players , ellsbury said of jeter they seem to do the right things when it matters most that s why he is who he is , doing the little things that helps your team win they do n't always go in the stat sheet but they 're crucial to the team s success ellsbury s single was his first hit of the game , and extended his hitting streak to 14 games , the longest active streak in the majors and the longest by a yankee since jeter hit in 19 straight in 2012 but manager joe girardi said what jeter did tuesday was not small anytime you can start rallies , those are big things , girardi said when you get yourself in scoring position with less than two outs , those are big things he was able to do that the yankees scored twice in the first with two outs with jeter on first , mark teixeira singled to center , with jeter holding at second beltran then doubled to left , scoring jeter , and brian mccann followed with an infield single to deep short to bring in teixeira that quickly ended a scoreless inning streak by seattle pitchers at 19 the yankees were a modest 2for3 with runners in scoring position in the first and 3for5 for the game , quite an advancement given their recent struggles in such situations over the previous 10 games , they had gone 19 for 105 \( 181 \) with runners in scoring position , including a 1for17 showing sunday in a 21 loss to kansas city the yankees are now 1811 in games decided by two runs or fewer the mariners got a run back in the bottom of the first against the lefthander vidal nuno after robinson cano s twoout double , cole gillespie drove him in with a single to center each team would hold back the other over the next fiveplus innings nuno , bumped back from his monday start because of a rainout in kansas city , needed a leaping catch by ichiro suzuki near the wall in right in the second inning that turned a potential extrabase hit by kyle seager into a long first out he needed a crashing catch against the wall at the 401foot mark by ellsbury on a drive by michael saunders with two on and two out in the fourth he needed jeter to keep him out of trouble in the fifth by adroitly handling brad miller s hot onehopper to his chest our defense played a big role today , nuno said we 've got some fast outfielders and they track balls down nuno allowed four hits and one run over five and twothirds innings , handing off to dellin betances betances \( 40 \) put himself in jeopardy in the seventh , hitting mike zunino with one out and allowing him to advance to second on a wild pitch nuno struck out saunders , but dustin ackley followed with a single inches over the glove of second baseman brian roberts zunino scored just ahead of suzuki s throw to tie the score at 22 iwakuma \( 43 \) , coming off a sixhit , seveninning performance in a 20 victory over atlanta on june 4 , allowed only five base runners after the first inning and none past first base but jeter , who is 6of9 against iwakuma in his career , got to him in the eighth with a groundrule double that bounced over the leftcenter wall that was it for iwakuma , who was replaced by charlie furbush ellsbury followed with a hard single on an 02 pitch to right field , scoring jeter easily this type of game has been eluding us a little bit , ellsbury said hopefully , if we can win these types of games we 're going to be in great shape coming in , the yankees had lost seven of their previous 10 games but girardi said after the win that he hoped that ellsbury s single was a huge hit that gets us on a roll here david robertson worked a routine ninth to pick up his 15th save in 17 opportunities
one possible result of a normalized relationship between the united states and cuba greater ease in the creation of concerts like new jazz frontiers , an experiment and a success presented on friday and saturday nights at jazz at lincoln center s appel room which is not to say that the rigorous 90minute set was all cuban music , or a singularly cubanized version of jazz there was a small group combining various musical languages , which has always happened under the banner of jazz , although this group did more combining than most , including elements of andalusian flamenco , venezuelan joropo , cuban son and american jazz it had a tricky instrumentation to do that with flute , harp , piano , bass and drums and it included a great cuban musician not often heard in new york , the flutist let s start with what it was not friday s concert did n't turn into a jam session , and it did n't become merely a showcase for the two frontline soloists , mr valle and the colombian harpist either kind of concert might have been enough for most listeners , because the abilities of those two musicians come at you like landslides mr valle s improvising on flute can intimate several people playing at once a concatenation of virtuosic lines piling up , colliding , billowing outward and mr castaneda can effectively turn the harp into a guitar , a piano or a percussion instrument he makes fine details and slashing attacks he plucks the strings so hard that they twang so what was it \? it was a group organized by jazz at lincoln center , planned well in advance but realized at the last minute , with two days' rehearsal each of the five members contributed original compositions mr valle and mr castaneda , as well as the new yorkbased venezuelan pianist the bassist , from hartford , a jazz musician who has played for years with the afrolatin bandleader eddie palmieri and , from new york city , a drummer whose interests have taken him to study in cuba , mali and the middle east \( there were old alliances within the group mr freedman and mr curtis had played together before , as had mr castaneda and mr simon \) there was a taut balance in the dimensions of the music surprisingly so , given the short rehearsal time and the multiple changes of form and rhythm in every piece the harp and flute solos were offset by mr simon s elegant , muteddynamics playing he made you feel his harmonic choices and his rhythmic emphasis while rarely raising his hands off the keys mr curtis has a resonant , intense sound , and mr freedman has a clear and specific one , but they made their approaches mesh what s more , all the players had clearly thought about how to combine the musical languages they understood best one example of many a piece by mr castaneda , colibri , combined the buler a rhythm from flamenco with joropo , the folkloric style that often includes harp it used common time signatures to bind them together that looks clever on paper , but none of the music sounded contrived plenty of music from around the world is related this group found the nodes of those relations , the rhythms or scales or repetitions , and stuck to what was most powerful and meaningful within them
in late spring , emma marris , the author of rambunctious garden saving nature in a postwild world , wrote beyond food and evil , a refreshing essay for the breakthrough journal on a new generation of chefs celebrating both nature and technology in their cuisine ingredients include lichen powder \( see the video above \) technology , including devices like the thermomix , has a jetsons feel i sought a reaction from shelley boris , a friend and neighbor who is the enterprising and earthcentered chef for the garrison institute and author of fresh cooking a year of recipes from the garrison institute kitchen  right around the time marris s piece ran , boris was organizing an earth day dinner for the institute exploring a cuisine suited to the anthropocene , this earth age dominated by human influences \( here s the menu \) here s boris s your dot contribution cooking is one long creative and scientific experiment and cooks have always been on the lookout for new tastes and technologies fire , fermenting , salting , thermometers , pressure cookers , microwaves , freeze drying , dehydrating , sous vide the same is true in agriculture and food processing , packaging and transportation some of our experiments are successes and some are failures , but there will always be curiosity to explore i was drawn to emma marris s essay because she digs into ideas about food that touch my interest in a quest for great taste while maintaining a commitment to sustainability philosophy and ethics are frequently the focus of serious food writing marris expands the conversation to include art and economics the piece is a reminder of how cooking has come to its current place as part of the art and culture of our time at the same time , marris notes that while basic principles and limits such a budget shape cooks choices , science can serve as a source of creativity and a means of banishing dogma i went to art school in the 1970s by then it was established that middleclass american kids trained in colleges rather than as apprentices this is similar to the experience of young chefs today things are gained and lost as young people are launched early into their careers , but the influence of ambitious and smart young chefs makes for a very dynamic time in the art and politics of food the expansion of an artist s vocabulary , techniques and message such as the breakthroughs of impressionism , dadaism , minimalism and performance art is going on in the food world now we used to ask , is this art \? now we are asking , is this food \? literally , is this edible \? yet , activists can get stuck the idea that sustainability is still the message , but that all local or grassfed may not be the answer , is discouragingly hard for some to accept increased vocabulary was for me the most important aspect of the food at alice waters s chez panisse great ingredients grown in the us , appreciated for what they are and in california , waters has had a long , luxurious , growing season to support her as time went on her interest took a turn toward policy , and inventiveness is maybe less a motivating force now in dwight garner s new york times article the end of cuisine , he describes nathan myhrvold \( the author of modernist cuisine \) salting wine because it balances the wine s flavors myhrvold says , the way we treat wine is governed by an implicit set of rules and strictures that rival fundamentalist religions in their severity and intensity it shocks people to put salt in wine but why \? it s just food ! that s one way to look at cuisine , and a refreshing way yes it is just food but the more food is truly approached as art , such as at restaurants like noma or coi , the more freethinking and invention critical for chefs is acceptable to their audience enter this new wave of chefs in the midst of a transition , what motivates new work may seem oppositional to what came before ren redzepi uses new technologies , but he also harkens back to a time of chef as magician while alice waters served people zucchini that tasted like none at the supermarkets of the 1950s , a meal from wylie dufresne resembles french restaurants of long ago in that flavor is drawn not only from the ingredients themselves , but the techniques , and stunning presentations alice waters , for years labeled an elitist , has worked her way into the home kitchen and she may have inspired folks to garden more than to cook or as michael pollan notes , to shop well for years i thought new york city was superior to california for its creativity , and that john thorne was smarter than alice waters about how to help a home cook face the increasingly intimidating food world of the 1980 s with his simple cooking i now look back and see more connections i keep a foot in both worlds i cook professionally , and when i eat out , i happily pay as much as i can for new tastes or techniques but in my book fresh cooking a year of recipes from the garrison institute , i represent the home cook , in particular the beginner who will be drawn to big , bright flavors from exposure to a variety of cuisines and will , as a consequence , have high expectations there lies the tension to find the creative place between indulgence and discipline , reality and ideals good politics doesn t by itself make great art or good science in fresh cooking , i write i think of our relatively limited budget as a creative force rather than as an impediment i use the best ingredients that my budget allows , but most of us have to allocate our resources carefully , and often spending more on something really good and pairing it with ingredients that cost much less is a good way to achieve flavor and satisfaction and while sustainability is essential for our survival , again from my book , i say , for some people , and i understand this feeling , a constant local and organic emphasis can be offputting , as it may be unavailable and unaffordable delicious meals can be made from the ingredients at any supermarket anywhere in the united states we need to accept that lasting change is slow , and that feeding people is in itself a goal , and a feat cookbooks like coi stories and recipes or noma time and place in nordic cuisine are not meant for typical home cooks they are inspiration as well as instructional for the ambitious , the way julia child brought us techniques that seemed over our heads in her day but for the dedicated student , brioche came alive in their kitchen at some point everyone will have a paco jet david chang will be james beard , and so on i promised myself when i listened to rock n roll i would never close my mind to new music it takes effort to cultivate new tastes whether it is hip hop for the jamband fan or lichen for the fresh mozzarella crowd , holding on to the spirit of youth prevents stagnation
gaziantep , turkey mary atwan , a trained nurse , has been a journalist in syria since 2012 , but only when she traveled to italy this week to receive a prestigious award did the world learn her real name maisa saleh it was also a first chance for the world outside a narrow circle in syria to see a sample of her work , which in addition to meriting this year s award for investigative journalism has earned her an arrest , imprisonment and exile in just a few short years her home now is here in the turkish city of gaziantep , 30 miles from the border with syria there is no thought of her returning to syria anytime soon i know they will arrest me , she said although she got her start as a reporter for the syrian opposition channel orient tv , it was her work as the host of a weekly talk show beginning in january of last year that vaulted her into prominence a natural brunette , on air ms saleh wore a short blond wig with bangs , sunglasses with large round frames and a scarf that covered her mouth and nose her voice was altered even her family was unaware that the woman they watched on television every week was their beloved maisa i absolutely could n't show my face because they would kill me , said ms saleh , who was arrested in april of last year by the syrian government on suspicion of being ms atwan she was released months later when the authorities could not prove their case they know i am a reporter , but they do n't know i am the same one who makes this show , she said still , many , many friends and activists do n't know the relative anonymity has been a comfort to ms saleh , 31 , who has feared with good reason that her political affiliations could compromise her family s safety , either with the government or the extreme militants fighting for control of syria when she was released from prison last october , she learned that her youngest sister had been taken by militants with the islamic state there is nothing , no information , ms saleh said is she alive \? has she died \? we do n't know but now , with most of her immediate family out of danger , she has decided to go public with her story , though she asked that none of her family members be identified by name born in aleppo , syria , into a family of freethinkers , ms saleh has long lived in fear of the government , first hafez alassad s and then that of his son , the current president , bashar alassad her father , an elementary school teacher , was a marxist who liked to read philosophy in his spare time my family was very openminded , said ms saleh , who was taught at an early age about human rights and social freedoms far from a normal upbringing in a police state we knew something needed to change a trained intensive care nurse , she was first arrested in 2004 after meeting covertly with a politically minded group of friends such gatherings , where they watched movies and plotted small protests in aleppo , were illegal the regime had control of all things in syria , ms saleh said we were looking for freedom ms saleh was released after a day of questioning , but the arrest flagged her as a possible conspirator when the arab spring unrest erupted , , she was targeted by mr assad s secret police the police came to the hospital and warned me , she said ms saleh soon left her job as the head nurse in a damascus hospital and went into hiding she began to set up field hospitals in damascus , the capital , to treat wounded demonstrators , who could not receive medical care at government hospitals if you were shot while protesting , you could not seek treatment , she said they would arrest you with the uprising in full swing , ms saleh described rushing to devastating scenes of destruction , dodging snipers and narrowly escaping bombs that killed many of her colleagues i was going without cover , but the free army helped me to get to these areas , she said , referring to the free syrian army , the prowestern rebel faction her life in perpetual danger , she became frustrated by the portrayal of revolutionaries in the syrian staterun news media as sectarian terrorists all tv channels , they were talking about the war in syria between armies , said ms saleh , who said she and many activists expressed their dissent through peaceful means we are not all of us free army her transition from medical work to journalism was for ideological reasons , as well as practical ones she needed the money so she took a job with orient tv , a syrian satellite channel that had been based in damascus but relocated to dubai , in the united arab emirates , after the conflict began , and started reporting from the field via skype in january 2013 , in an audacious move , ms saleh began producing her own program , from the capital , right under the noses of the secret police in damascus , as the program s title suggested the show brought together civilian activists for discussions on issues such as sectarian violence and the role of the arts in the uprising she shot segments from secret locations in damascus , brazenly going through checkpoints and hiding her wig , scarf and other incriminating items in her handbag , which the police at that time were too polite to search the 45minute news talk show was the only one of its kind , before or since in one episode , four activists can be seen sitting on a sofa in a nondescript apartment while it was taped during the day , the lighting was kept low and the participants' faces were covered or blurred it was very high risk , ms saleh said of the chances her interview subjects took they knew i cannot help them if anything happens they knew we did it because we believed that it was good for our country eventually , she said , a friend cracked under torture and told the police where to find her she was captured at a local cafe in cinematic fashion when we went out of the cafe there were many policemen with guns , with kalashnikovs , she said one of the officers grabbed her arm and told her , welcome , miss mary i have n't slept in 40 days while i am looking for you i told him i am not mary , she said i am maisa prison being almost a rite of passage among many in ms saleh s circle , she plays down her time in custody she was beaten , but not badly , she said for many others , prison has meant torture , even death i am not a story , she said the local news media do not agree , and she has been pressed for interviews since her release in october 2013 in a prisoner exchange involving lebanon , turkey , qatar and the palestinian authority she repeatedly denied the news media requests things , however , are changing , as both she and most of her immediate family are now out of syria she is about to reenter the spotlight , this time as herself , on a television show on orient tv about syrian female activists there are many stories i want people to know , she said
dharamsala , india this year marks the first election in which indianborn tibetan refugees have the right to vote , but as the state of himachal pradesh , including the residents of this shady hill station , went to the polls on wednesday , there were few tibetans among them it is magnanimous on the part of the indian government to recognize the tibetans as natural citizens as they , like me , are born in india , tenzin tsundue , 40 , a poetactivist , said sardonically but the announcement doesn t really suit the political reality , he continued we are legally foreigners though sentimentally we call ourselves refugees subject to various restrictions on something as basic as movement within india and ownership of properties how then can a foreigner take part in the indian elections \? in dharamsala , only 237 eligible tibetan refugees submitted their voter registration forms by the deadline of april 15 , said harish gajju , the magistrate in dharamsala of those , 217 were issued voter identity cards according to a 2009 demographic survey by the central tibetan administration , the government in exile , 13 , 701 tibetan refugees live in dharamsala , home to the tibetan government in exile and the dalai lama , the tibetan spiritual leader , and 94 , 203 in all of india but it had no data on the number of tibetans who would be eligible to vote in india the response is very poor , mr gajju said we were hoping about 5 , 000 to 7 , 000 tibetan refugees would enroll he said the tibetans were concerned that registering to vote would mean losing their status as refugees , which is attached to both their tibetan identity and government entitlements we tried to create awareness and allay their fears as much as we could , he said mr tsundue and other tibetans living in dharamsala said they didn t want to participate in india s democracy because it was a step toward integrating with a country they hoped to leave for their true home we have never felt that we are citizens of india not because we didn t want to , but because we have been preoccupied with our struggle for tibet s freedom , said mr tsundue , who is a member of the tibetan youth congress , which demands complete independence for tibet , as opposed to the exiled government s advocacy of genuine autonomy within china this is my only goal in life , and one day , i hope to go back to our own country bhuchung d sonam , a tibetanborn writer and commentator on tibetan issues , said tibetans also had their own electoral process in choosing leaders for the central tibetan administration we did not come here to take part in this system , he said we came here to fight for tibet s freedom so the question can also arise about our future legitimacy lobsang sangay , the political head of the tibetans and the prime minister of the tibetan government in exile , said the central tibetan administration had left it up to each individual to decide whether to vote in india from what we hear , so far only a few people have registered , which could also be because the announcement came very late and people were caught unawares , he said but he praised india for allowing tibetans the right to vote the indian government has done a lot for the tibetans , and this is also an extension of that , he said mr sangay , who took over the reins of the tibetan government in exile after the dalai lama relinquished his role as the political head , was born in the lamahatta tibetan camps of the darjeeling hills in west bengal in 1968 when asked whether he would vote , he said , i would like to stay away because my primary objective is to look after the welfare of tibetans across the world the few tibetans who have registered to vote are trying to convince others that participating in the indian elections would give them a platform in india to lobby for their cause , rather than hinder it namgyal dolkar lhagyari , vice president of the guchusum movement of tibet , an organization in the dharamsala hill station town of mcleod ganj that helps former tibetan political prisoners , said that through the power of the vote , tibetans could pressure india to push china to start a dialogue with the dalai lama as the indianborn daughter of tibetan refugees , ms lhagyari , 27 , fought a legal battle to get an indian passport , which the government had previously refused to give to tibetans like her because of their refugee status in 2010 , the delhi high court upheld her claim to indian citizenship as an indian citizen and as a person of tibetan origin , i have my duty towards both the countries , she said i am trying to do just that by exercising my right to vote but even with her hardwon right , ms lhagyari was dispirited by the lack of choices on her first ballot , which she will cast in her hometown of dehradun in uttarakhand state there s not a single person suitable for the job , she said she listed her reasons for her disenchantment with the major national parties narendra modi of the bharatiya janata party did well in his home state of gujarat , but she didn t agree with his hindu nationalist agenda rahul gandhi of the indian national congress seemed like a good guy but wasn t prime minister material and arvind kejriwal of the aam aadmi party was a big disappointment those sentiments about the parties national leaders will inform her decision about their local candidates , she said looks like i will have to go all the way to my hometown , dehradun , to exercise the none of the above option , she said anuradha sharma is a freelance journalist based in kolkata follow her on twitter at
boston church bells tolled across boston on monday as a hearse bearing the body of thomas m menino , this city s longestserving mayor , rolled through the streets , from historic faneuil hall , where he lay in state , to the church in the hyde park neighborhood where he had been baptized and where mourners bid their final farewell thousands of bostonians lined the 10mile route to view the procession for mr menino , who died thursday at the age of 71 , just 10 months after he left office too young and too soon , many said , for him and his wife , angela , to enjoy his retirement each church bell rang 71 times , creating a cacophonous wave through the clear fall air the procession , choreographed by mr menino himself , wove its way through beacon hill , around fenway park and through distressed neighborhoods that mr menino had helped revive along the way , bystanders stood with their hands over their hearts or gave the thumbsup sign the scene sometimes resembled a parade , as people waved flags at other points , it resembled a political campaign , with supporters holding greenandwhite signs that read thank you mayor menino many applauded some wept the procession gave residents like joan harris , 53 , a former auditor who , like many in the city , had met the former mayor a chance to say goodbye she stood outside a metal police barrier near the church for nearly five hours before the funeral began he worked hard for my people , she said roxbury and dorchester , after the whites left the area , it was slums he rebuilt those neighborhoods former president bill clinton made a lastminute appearance at faneuil hall he stayed just 15 minutes , embracing family members as they set off on the procession among those at the mass at most precious blood church in hyde park were bill russell , the former celtics star david ortiz , the red sox slugger and pedro martinez , the former red sox pitcher vice president joseph r biden jr , secretary of state john kerry and senator elizabeth warren were among the many politicians who attended , but none spoke at the service , gov deval patrick and mayor martin j walsh , mr menino s successor , shared their thoughts and the former mayor s grandchildren gave a glimpse of what it was like to be close to someone with power every time it snowed out , i called pappa to make sure he knew school needed to be canceled , said samantha menino , a granddaughter mitchell weiss , his former chief of staff , told a wry anecdote about the mayor asking mr weiss s 2yearold daughter for some ice cream i can still see her shaking her head no , mr weiss recalled , adding , it s a good thing she did n't need building permits the mourners laughed heartily and applauded , knowing full well that mr menino , who controlled the city with an iron fist , would deny such permits to those who crossed him in this affectionate telling , even a 2yearold outside the church , a soloist sang my way , mr menino s favorite anthem , reducing many mourners to tears then the bagpipes skirled , and the coffin was loaded into the hearse and borne away for a private burial
season 2 , episode 4 dirty jobs it s all a matter of trust layers are slipping away , with trust eroding in the domestic bastion of the bill masters household , between husband and wife and wife and nanny and it seems further weakened , if existent at all , in the workplace , between bill and his newest employer and between virginia johnson and her remaining bosses lives and charades of lives have begun to peel away some elements burn up quickly some keep fraying and hanging on if ever there were a midpoint in a series ripe for a time jump , well , showtime s second season of masters of sex may be approaching that crossroads \( and we may just get into the 1960s sometime soon \) dirty work at home , when dr william masters \( michael sheen \) holds a diaper pail at arm s length , he s not just acting out against one of life s dirty jobs , a reference to the title of this episode keeping that pail at a distance largely represents how little a grip he has on his marriage and how far apart he is from his wife , libby \( caitlin fitzgerald \) , and their infant he also often holds virginia johnson \( lizzy caplan \) at bay , treating her like an unpaid secretary and stressing his marital status while being unable to function on many levels without her at his side or as he pleads with his new boss , dr doug greathouse \( danny huston \) , virginia is essential to his work that becomes even more clear at gateway memorial hospital , where his footing over his research restart seems quite unsteady new and previous test subjects remind dr bill of his shortcomings in contrast to virginia s ability to build a bridge with them she eased their anxiety , kept the instruments warm , and so on one subject quits , telling him that her husband wouldn t permit her to continue without a female researcher present \( with only dr bill watching \) in part , i can t decide if this episode was more about bill s precarious foothold in life and work , or virginia s both seem to have underestimated the consequences of their pretenses and actions the nanny knows best this episode weaves a lot of discomforting power plays between characters libby keeps trying to exert her authority , sans bill , over her africanamerican nanny , coral \( keke palmer \) whether it s lice or a little tepee tent that coral makes for the baby out of a plastic cup , libby expresses the loss of control over her turf in ways that border on cruelty \( pronunciations ask vs ax with coral \) and efforts at dominance \( shampooing coral s hair , then doling out the money to have it redone \) this relationship is about trust , libby tells coral , scolding her for turning to bill on the question of whether she , as a black person , was susceptible to lice \( he said no \) we need to be on the same side if you have a problem with something , you come to me dr masters is a busy man , and we don t need to involve him i keep asking myself , what is libby becoming as a wife , a mother , an employer \? granted , it s still the 1950s , and she s pretty clueless about the ramifications of her husband s research , but she s quite irritated by his obsession with it still , how is it that libby , who seemed to grow last season , has become someone who exhibits a meanness toward employees \? for me , her treatment of coral seems out of character the big reveal you knew it would be dr playboy , austin langham , estranged from his wife , who discovers bill and virginia while hanging out with his kids at none other than the chancery park plaza hotel in alton , ill , the rendezvous point for this research pair and he so enjoys pinning all the players onto an exposed board but doesn t it seem too obviously scripted for langham \( teddy sears \) to find them there on the same night that virginia has a bizarre dream , or nightmare , exposing her fears of being valued for sleeping with her boss rather than for her work \?

langham s disclosures prove a heartbreaking disappointment for dr depaul , who painfully , tearfully tries to coax secrets out of virginia as they wait for her to receive another cancer treatment she begs for what might be described as a little girl talk , sharing how she once cheated , and asking for something in return this was a test and one i found rather troubling , because there are so few female partnerships or equal discussions in this series so far virginia s unwillingness to impart any morsel of an interesting life , or divulge her affair with bill , clinches what dr depaul had , i suspect , been planning to end if virginia failed to yield she can no longer trust virginia , who is yet another ambitious woman sleeping her way onward so dr depaul , who faces oblivion anyway with terminal cancer , turns over her program declaring that there are no proper personnel at the hospital to manage it to dr georgios nikolaou papanikolaou , who had invented the screening mechanism is virginia so invested in her own ambition that she didn t realize how hurtful her actions would be \?

tampa , fla piece by piece , player by player , the 2014 are assembling here two days ahead of the official reporting date , carlos beltran , brian roberts and kelly johnson were the latest players to arrive at spring training monday , working out together at the team s minor league complex in anticipation of what some of them say could be a special season , perhaps even ending in ultimate glory i feel personally that our club has a good chance , beltran said i know it s going to be hard because the american league east division is a strong division but we feel we have a good team beltran was one of several players the yankees signed to help erase the failure of last season , when they did not make the playoffs the idea was to add a starting pitcher and make the lineup deeper robinson cano and curtis granderson left via free agency , but beltran , jacoby ellsbury , brian mccann , masahiro tanaka , roberts and johnson were brought in for what the yankees believe will be a net improvement the yankees committed more than 460 million to those players , with a mandate to more than just return to the playoffs of course we have to win , beltran said in the minor league parking lot after his workout i do n't know how far we will go , but at least we have to do something positive better than what they did last year they went out and they spent a lot of money and brought in players to improve the ball club for me as a player , you want to be around an organization like that where every year they are trying to improve and get better it has long been a dream of beltran s to play for the yankees , dating to when he was a youngster in puerto rico idolizing their center fielder , bernie williams there were two other occasions when beltran wanted to join the yankees as a free agent instead , he went to the mets in 2005 when williams was still the yankees' center fielder , and then the st louis cardinals in 2012 when the yankees had granderson , nick swisher and brett gardner in the outfield finally , this year the yankees found room for beltran , 36 on dec 6 he agreed to a threeyear , 45 million contract to play right field , the same day cano agreed to a 10year , 240 million contract with the seattle mariners monday was beltran s first day on the field as a yankee , but he played down the idea that his dream was finally fulfilled that feeling may not come until he puts on pinstripes for the home opener april 7 on monday , he worked out with roberts at second base a position he has never played as a professional even turning some double plays but beltran said he was spending time there only as a way to get to know roberts , a fellow switch hitter roberts , 36 , has played 1 , 213 games at second base , all for the baltimore orioles , his only team before joining the yankees if beltran was signed to help recoup the loss of cano s offensive numbers , roberts was given the unenviable task of replacing cano at second base , where he often dazzled as a twotime gold glove fielder i'm not going to be robbie and i'm not going to try to be , roberts said i'm going to be brian roberts and hopefully that is good enough roberts will be a bridge that connects two of the game s greatest shortstops his first season with the orioles was cal ripken s final season this year , he will play alongside derek jeter in his final year roberts said that it was jeter who once instilled in him the confidence that he could become a good major league player it was the 2004 season , roberts recalled , and he had reached second base in a game against the yankees between pitches , roberts said , jeter told him , you can be a 300 hitter in this league i think he does it to everybody , roberts said of jeter s encouragement but for some reason , when he tells it to you , you think you 're the most important person in the world beltran also noted the honor of playing alongside jeter , who broke into the major leagues in 1995 , the year beltran was drafted by the kansas city royals with five championships on jeter s r sum , beltran is hoping some of that world series magic will rub off on him i'm just looking forward to working with him and helping this team win a championship , he said i know he has a lot of championships but i do n't have none , so hopefully i can win one inside pitch michael pineda , who was acquired from seattle two years ago in a trade for jesus montero , threw a bullpen session monday and seemed to impress manager joe girardi pineda , who is competing to become the no 5 starter , is coming off 2012 shoulder surgery and said he thought he was throwing the way he did before the surgery
the picture is finally coming into focus in the southeastern conference s west division it has been a long , grueling road to the title , but this game will leave a team on top of a division that once had four of the nation s top five teams alabama and mississippi state are the remaining sec west teams in the top five , and each controls its destiny to win a national championship the crimson tide are a 9 point favorite at home , and the bulldogs are in the familiar underdog role mississippi state began the season unranked , but after knocking off thenno 8 louisiana state , no 6 texas am and no 2 auburn over a fourweek stretch in late september and october , it vaulted to no 1 , which it has not relinquished quarterback dak prescott is the heisman trophy frontrunner , but he will need a good performance to remain the favorite two of alabama s three losses over the last three years have come against mobile quarterbacks prescott is averaging 865 yards per game on the ground \( eighth in the sec \) and is tied for the conference lead with 11 rushing touchdowns he has also thrown 17 touchdown passes and averages 2479 yards passing a game although prescott gets most of the headlines , running back josh robinson has had a superb season as well he is also tied atop the sec with 11 rushing touchdowns , and he is second in the conference in rushing , averaging 10933 yards per game with talented receivers , led by de'runya wilson , the bulldogs' offense will be tough to stop if anyone is up to the task , it is alabama , which leads the conference in total defense and rushing defense and is third in passing defense the defense was at its best last week in a tough , physical 2013 overtime victory over lsu in baton rouge alabama s defense is a big and bruising unit up front , jarran reed and a shawn robinson are monsters , allowing linebackers reggie ragland and trey depriest to make plays last week , quarterback blake sims came to life against lsu the offense got the ball back with 50 seconds left trailing by 3 points , and sims led the tide on a nineplay , 55yard drive that ended with a gametying field goal sims also threw a gamewinning 6yard touchdown pass in overtime now sims is back in tuscaloosa , where he has been at his best mississippi state is last in the sec and 123rd in the football bowl subdivision in pass defense , allowing just over 300 yards per game the bulldogs are very good at stopping the run and getting after the quarterback , but their struggles against the pass could mean that amari cooper is poised for a big day cooper is the best receiver in college football , and a big game would solidify him as a leading candidate for the heisman trophy if he sees single coverage , expect big plays after their midseason run , the bulldogs have not been overly impressive against weaker competition it feels as if alabama is on a roll and that sims and cooper are going to have a big day and keep the tide headed toward the college football playoff is this the week the seminoles' luck runs out \? they have struggled to put a complete game together all season it seems as if florida state is poised to either play its best or finally be upset fsu has won a teamrecord 25 straight games , but the hurricanes have a history of ending florida state s long winning streaks both socalled wide right losses came when the seminoles were riding winning streaks of 16 games or longer seminoles quarterback jameis winston threw 40 touchdown passes and only 10 interceptions on his way to winning the heisman last season this year , he has thrown 11 picks , including five in his last two games still , winston has never lost a college game if not for his offthefield problems , he would certainly be in the running for the heisman for miami , the offense starts with running back duke johnson , who averages 1347 yards per game and 768 yards per carry johnson has gone for more than 100 yards in each of his last five games florida state has struggled against the run and is thin up front , but it has found a way to make adjustments in the second half of games to fix these issues miami quarterback brad kaaya is a freshman who has looked very impressive this season kaaya leads the atlantic coast conference in touchdown passes and quarterback rating and averages 9 yards per attempt , ninth most in college football miami started the season 33 , with road losses to louisville , nebraska and georgia tech , but has won its last three and has had an extra week to prepare the hurricanes seem to be gaining confidence , and a veteran defense has been playing its best recently florida state is only a 2 point favorite expect a close game and do n't be surprised by an upset the inside track in the big ten west is on the line these teams are tied with minnesota atop the division , but neither has played the golden gophers wisconsin has looked unbeatable at home , while the cornhuskers have struggled on the road against ranked teams since bo pelini took over as coach the game features two of the top running backs in the nation , wisconsin s melvin gordon and nebraska s ameer abdullah gordon averages 1667 yards per game , best in the nation , and is second with 19 rushing touchdowns abdullah injured his knee on nov 1 against purdue , but he is expected to play abdullah leads the nation in allpurpose yards 1879 per game and is a huge part of the cornhuskers offense if he is not fully healthy , nebraska will struggle both running backs are jockeying for position in the heisman race , and this game may go a long way toward deciding who will get an invitation to new york it is hard to pick against wisconsin at home the sec west gets all the attention , but the sec east race is intriguing missouri is in the driver s seat , but georgia is right behind and has a victory over the tigers for georgia , running back todd gurley returns from suspension as the bulldogs face an auburn team that imploded at home last week , losing to texas am missouri , which lost at home to indiana , controls its destiny if the east champion finds a way to upset a possibly topranked west team in the conference title game , it would be tough to keep that team out of the playoff since losing to virginia tech , the buckeyes have reeled off seven consecutive wins , none bigger than last week s victory over michigan state quarterback j t barrett played his best game of the season when it mattered , throwing for 300 yards , three touchdowns and no interceptions and running for 86 yards and two more scores the forecast calls for temperatures in the mid20s , with a possibility of snow showers the gophers lost at tcu in september and on oct 25 at illinois that was illinois s only conference victory of the season ohio state is trying to make its case that the virginia tech loss was an aberration and that it belongs in the playoff conversation the buckeyes will need a big win to prove that point with harvard up next week , yale looks to keep pace in the ivy league against a princeton team that shared the league title last year with harvard the crimson are undefeated in the league , but yale , princeton and dartmouth are tied for second with one loss dartmouth won at yale , and princeton will host dartmouth next week a yale victory would set up a showdown with harvard next week , with at least a share of the title on the line princeton was routed at home , 497 , by harvard

beijing china has not held back in forcing the pace of the search for malaysia airlines flight 370 it has deployed 21 satellites and a flotilla of naval ships it has dispatched investigators to malaysia , run background checks on the chinese passengers , and scoured radar images of its vast western regions every day it has cajoled , chided and criticized malaysian officials and still it has come up emptyhanded two weeks after the plane vanished on an overnight flight to beijing , no trace of the boeing 777 jet or the , twothirds of whom are chinese , has been found the painful process of working with malaysia in searching for the airplane and investigating what went wrong in the early hours of march 8 has revealed the limits of china s power , influence and technological and military might in the region , despite its rapid rise as a rival to the united states and american strategic dominance of the western pacific within china , anguished relatives and friends of the passengers and their many sympathizers are pressing hard for answers , but the government finds itself helpless as malaysia takes the lead in the search and investigation efforts , which is consistent with international norms on air disasters malaysia has been keeping other nations , including china , at a distance , to the frustration of officials here , according to political observers that tension is reflected in the frequent condemnations of malaysia that have appeared in the chinese state news media china is out of its comfort zone , no longer in the position of strength from which it usually deals with smaller asian nations , including malaysia the two countries have for decades maintained strong economic ties , and xi jinping , the chinese leader , promised closer economic and military cooperation on a visit to malaysia last october at the same time , china has not been shy about on a range of delicate issues in january , it to a reef in the south china sea that is claimed by malaysia in 2012 , of six ethnic uighurs who had fled from china now , chinese officials find themselves desperately prodding malaysia to share information , to allow china a hand in the investigation and to placate the irate chinese families who demand answers daily if you do n't push them , they wo n't move , zhu zhenming , a scholar of southeast asia at the yunnan academy of social sciences , said about the malaysian authorities it s mostly to do with their administrative management capabilities , but also their culture he added that malaysia was too lacking when it came to dealing with disaster management not because they do n't want to do it , but because they cannot that sense of frustration , and perhaps condescension , has come through even in official chinese remarks that were intended to be diplomatic on tuesday , huang huikang , the chinese ambassador to malaysia , told reporters in kuala lumpur , the malaysian capital , that the malaysian government has insufficient capabilities , technologies and experience in responding to the mh370 incident , but they did their best in some ways , the complaints reinforce a belief that many chinese have long held that their political culture is superior to those of southeast asian nations in that worldview , southeast asia has throughout history been a lessdeveloped region that looked up to china and tried to both appease and imitate it malaysia , a country dominated by an ethnic malay , mostly muslim population with a significant ethnic chinese minority , is no exception , in the eyes of many chinese the plane crisis is strengthening those prejudices , analysts say the image of the malaysian government has dropped in the eyes of the chinese government and the chinese people , said bo zhiyue , a scholar of chinese politics at the east asian institute of the national university of singapore compared to the malaysian government , the chinese government is quicker and more responsive he said the episode has reinforced the view among chinese that their system is not inferior to other systems , and is in some ways superior to other systems in its efficiency like china , malaysia has been governed by the same political party for decades , but there are important differences malaysia has robust opposition parties , and unlike many of its neighbors , its military has not played a major role in domestic politics that means that malaysian commanders have less frequent contact with civilian leaders than their counterparts in some other asian nations , including china , where mr xi , chief of the communist party , directs the military some political analysts say that if the malaysian military had closer ties to civilian officials , there might have been earlier agreement on how to interpret and share military radar data that tracked an aircraft , now believed to be flight 370 , flying westward to the indian ocean rather than going down near its original course across the gulf of thailand , where search efforts were focused in the first days after it disappeared the late announcement of the radar data embarrassed malaysia and angered many other nations in malaysia , the system is much more decentralized , mr bo said the military has their own domain mr huang , the chinese ambassador , said tuesday that malaysia needed to be much more open with the information it had that night , xinhua , the chinese state news agency , published a commentary that said due to the lack of transparency , massive efforts have been squandered and numerous rumors have been swirling , repeatedly racking the nerves of the waiting families therefore , there is no excuse for repeating the same mistakes chinese officials are under intense pressure to solve the mystery of flight 370 in part because of the timing of its disappearance , just one week after attackers went on a knifing rampage in a train station in southwest china , killing 29 people and injuring nearly 150 chinese officials said that the rampage was a terrorist act and that the attackers appeared to have come from xinjiang , the western province where violence has been mounting between ethnic uighurs and the ruling ethnic han many people initially thought that flight 370 s disappearance was another act of terrorism , possibly committed by uighurs , though american officials say they believe terrorists are probably not involved china s own investigation of its citizens on the plane found that none had any ties to militancy , including an ethnic uighur who was on board nevertheless , both the train station massacre and the flight s disappearance are national traumas arising from events beyond the control of the chinese authorities , said mr bo , the scholar in singapore it s a little sensitive , and it seems a little embarrassing , he said they need to make an extra effort to make it look like they 're taking it seriously and commit resources to find an answer to the problem chinese propaganda officials have ordered domestic news organizations to not independently analyze or comment on the flight , and to ensure that their coverage is consistent with material provided by the chinese government , according to china digital times , an organization in berkeley , calif , that tracks the chinese news media chinese military officials have become intensely focused on the missing plane , said one western official here who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomatic issues involved these guys in the military are drilling themselves into the ground , the official said they 're not going home at night they want information , information , information but there s nothing they can get on wednesday afternoon , gen fang fenghui , chief of the general staff of the people s liberation army , called a malaysian commander and said that as long as there was a glimmer of hope , everyone had to put in 100 percent effort , according to an announcement on the chinese defense ministry s website general fang added that the malaysian military could give more assistance to the chinese military in the search efforts , the announcement said the feeling of helplessness in china was also reflected at the malaysian government news conference in kuala lumpur on wednesday , when chinese relatives of missing passengers and unfurled banners demanding action guards dragged them away , but not before journalists inside recorded their cries of anguish where is my son \? a woman in a pink blouse screamed why are you not giving me answers \?
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina bosnia s most widespread antigovernment protests in almost two decades shut down the center of sarajevo and affected five other cities on monday , as demonstrators vented their anger at politicians whom they view as selfserving and corrupt bosnia has struggled under the most cumbersome political system in europe , created by the americanbrokered that halted mass bloodshed in the country in the 1990s since then , the national government has proved unable to achieve public prosperity or anything more than tenuous peace angry youths and recently laidoff workers in tuzla , a former industrial hub in northern bosnia , setting off demonstrations across the ethnically mixed parts of bosnia that are governed by the muslimcroat federation far less unrest has been reported in the parts of the country run by the serbian republic , which in general has less freedom of expression about 1 , 000 protesters fanned out across downtown sarajevo on monday , chanting slogans against criminals in government and urging those in authority to resign today the march drew a cross section of ages , with a few workers and many more middleclass students or unemployed graduates it passed without any clashes , with the riot police guarding government buildings several of the younger demonstrators said they were there because , as sajida tulic , a 27yearold actress , put it this is not a way of living we want our dignity back another demonstrator , lejla kusturica , said , i think the biggest fear of our politicians is a united people ms kusturica , 29 , who later briefly addressed the ragtag crowd through a megaphone that was barely audible to most demonstrators , said she was not deterred by politicians denouncing the demonstrators as hooligans , because we have no other chance police violence against demonstrators in tuzla last week set off a protest on friday in sarajevo , where masked youths stormed two major government buildings , setting fires and smashing windows unrest was reported in at least a dozen other towns , although in some places the crowds were small the best thing is that it is not just sarajevo , jasmin telalic , 21 , an engineering student , said on monday in the bosnian capital local news media reported unrest in mostar , a predominantly croat city in the south , as well as in tuzla and other locations staterun news media and officials have said in recent days that the demonstrators were organized hooligans , or were mixed up with drug dealers , but the sarajevo protest on monday had a makeshift air some participants carried flimsy handmade signs railing against factory closings or against certain politicians they called for a new government of the expert , the young and , above all , the uncorrupt bosnia s political system allows scores of political parties to obtain state financing , and the proliferation of bureaucracies in addition to the muslimcroat and serb entities , there is a threeperson presidency , 10 cantonal administrations and scores of municipalities has made the government by far the country s biggest employer the dayton accords among the leaders of warring serbs , croats and muslims the latter now called bosniaks brought an end to the 199295 civil war by constructing a decentralized state that gave each a share of power and none of them dominance the chief american negotiator , richard c holbrooke , who , was widely hailed for his diplomatic skill in ending the slaughter but the bosnians have since added layers of complexity to the original design that have entrenched the political elite while often hindering economic development overall unemployment is estimated at 27 percent to 40 percent , and as many as 70 percent of young people are said to be without work backroom deals between businesses and those in political power have been a way of life here at least since the communist yugoslav days of josip broz tito , who is nonetheless revered here for having kept at bay the ethnic rivalries that nationalist politicians exploited in the 1990s after his death in 1980 the wars that resulted killed more than 100 , 000 people and caused millions to flee their homes social media primarily facebook and twitter has recently harnessed longsimmering frustration and anger at state corruption , leading to demonstrations where the gulf between the protesters and the political elite was palpable , and somewhat reminiscent of the recent , far bigger antigovernment protests in ukraine bosnia has received billions of dollars in aid , and foreign officials and forces have been sent to help coax the ravaged country back to peaceful life compared with how things were 18 years ago , there have been achievements but they have fallen far short of what western donors and leaders had hoped the unrest now is a wakeup call , according to the british foreign secretary , william hague several older demonstrators in sarajevo said monday that they were marching on behalf of their children or grandchildren i just want to support the young people of our country , said belma ridzal , 44 , who said she splits her time between sarajevo and amsterdam

washington images of violent clashes between heavily armed police officers and protesters in ferguson , mo , have forced the federal government to review its policy of providing local police forces with militarystyle equipment but the department of homeland security on tuesday wanted everyone to remember the terrifying hours last year after bombs exploded near the boston marathon finish line , when police officers wearing , and full went from house to house , hunting for the bombers after the search ended , neighbors gathered in the streets and cheered grant funds provided to massachusetts and to boston saved lives and restored and ensured public safety in the aftermath of the boston marathon bombing , brian e kamoie , a senior homeland security grant administrator , told members of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee at a hearing on tuesday about equipment given to local police departments his testimony focused heavily on boston before even mentioning the clashes , and the show of heavily armed officers in ferguson that prompted the hearing that testimony , from the government agency responsible for the largest share of domestic security grants , highlights the political hurdle that congress and the white house face any effort to reverse the longstanding policy of arming and fortifying american cities will run into criticism that washington is leaving towns unprepared for terrorist attacks homeland security and justice department grants , along with equipment giveaways from the pentagon , have provided the police with automatic weapons , heavily armored trucks , nightvision goggles , aircraft and more these programs were created or greatly expanded after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , and have been among the most popular programs for politicians in washington and around the country lawmakers have faced tremendous pressure since 9 11 to keep security spending high and steer it toward their districts , senator claire mccaskill , democrat of missouri , said after the hearing have we gotten carried away \? she asked i think the testimony today showed that we have to some extent terrorism in the united states is extremely rare now well below the numbers seen in the 1960s and '70s under questioning from senator tom coburn , republican of oklahoma , representatives of the department of homeland security and the pentagon struggled to identify examples , other than boston , when the gear was used for counterterrorism we 've stepped across the line and actually have created some problems that would n't have been there otherwise , said mr coburn , a longtime critic of the grant programs who , in his final two years in office , has new allies in congress the protests in ferguson came after the fatal shooting of michael brown , an unarmed black teenager , by a white police officer police officers in full body armor responded a sniper rode a bearcat armored truck , paid for with 360 , 000 in federal money they pointed assault rifles at unarmed protesters and fired tear gas into crowds this was a military force , and they were facing down an enemy , ms mccaskill said while questioning by the committee was largely critical , it is not clear whether there is wide support in congress for changing the programs president obama has ordered a governmentwide review of the policies , but that review is in its nascent stages and the president did not publicly set a deadline for completing it one of the policies under review is a pentagon program that transfers surplus military equipment to the local police though it played a relatively minor role in outfitting police officers in ferguson , the program has come under heavy scrutiny since the protests there figures released tuesday by congress showed that some police departments with fewer than 10 fulltime officers had received large mineresistant trucks designed to withstand roadside bombs in iraq many police departments received enough automatic rifles , such as m16s , to give several to each officer bayonets are available under the program , said alan f estevez , the principal deputy undersecretary for acquisition for the defense department i ca n't answer what a local police force would need a bayonet for i can give you the answer , replied senator rand paul , republican of kentucky none police chiefs know changes will be made to the federal programs , whether from congress or the administration , according to jim bueermann , the president of the , a research group in washington , who testified tuesday he recommended that , before receiving equipment , police departments be required to prove that they informed the public , trained their officers and set policies for using the gear mr kamoie , from homeland security , noted that his agency s grants did not pay for weapons he said infrared , helicoptermounted surveillance gear bought with federal grants was instrumental in locating dzhokhar tsarnaev , a suspect in the boston bombing mr coburn corrected him mr tsarnaev was discovered not by the police but who once the police allowed people to leave their homes walked outside and noticed a pool of blood in his boat parked in his backyard mr coburn presented an article from the boston globe recounting the events mr kamoie seemed surprised he said his colleagues had credited the helicopter camera i look forward to reading that article , he said
this is the eighth in a series of interviews about religion that i am conducting for the stone the interviewee for this installment is michael ruse , a professor of philosophy at florida state university and the author of the forthcoming book atheism what everyone needs to know gary gutting what do you think of the claim that scientific accounts provide all the explanations needed to understand the existence and nature of the world , so that there s no need to posit god as the ultimate explanation \? michael ruse let me start at a more general level by saying that i don t think science as such can explain everything therefore , assuming that the existence and nature of the world can be fully understood \( i m not sure it can ! \) , this is going to require something more than science as far as i am concerned , if you want god to have a crack at the job , go right ahead ! gg could you say a bit more about why you think that science can t fully explain everything \? mr in my view , none of our knowledge , including science , just tells it like it is knowledge , even the best scientific knowledge , interprets experience through human cultural understanding and experience , and above all \( just as it is for poets and preachers \) metaphor is the key to the whole enterprise as i developed my own career path , as a historian and philosopher of evolutionary biology , this insight grew and grew everything was metaphorical struggle for existence , natural selection , division of labor , genetic code , arms races and more gg it s clear that metaphors are useful when scientists try to explain complex ideas in terms that nonscientists can understand , but why do you think metaphors have an essential role in the development of scientific knowledge \? mr because metaphor helps you move forward it is heuristic , forcing you to ask new questions if your love is like a rose , what color is the rose \? but note that it does so at a cost a metaphor puts blinkers on us some questions are unanswerable within the context of the metaphor my love is a rose tells me about her beauty it does not tell me about her mathematical abilities now combine this fact with history since the scientific revolution , one metaphor above all the root metaphor has dictated the nature and progress of science this is the metaphor of the world as a machine , the mechanical metaphor what questions are ruled out by this metaphor \? one is about ultimate origins of course you can ask about the origins of the metal and plastics in your automobile , but ultimately the questions must end and you must take the materials as given so with the world i think the machine metaphor rules out an answer to what martin heidegger called the fundamental question of metaphysics why is there something rather than nothing \? unlike wittgenstein , i think it is a genuine question , but not one answerable by modern science coming now to my own field of evolutionary biology , i see some questions that it simply doesn t ask but that can be asked and answered by other areas of science i think here about the natural origins of the universe and the big bang theory i see some questions that it doesn t ask and that neither it nor any other science can answer one such question is why there is something rather than nothing , or if you like why ultimately there are material substances from which organisms are formed gg so do you think that we need religion to answer the ultimate question of the world s origin \? mr if the person of faith wants to say that god created the world , i don t think you can deny this on scientific grounds but you can go after the theist on other grounds i would raise philosophical objections for example , about the notion of a necessary being i would also fault christian theology i don t think you can mesh the ancient greek philosophers notion of a god outside time and space with the jewish notion of a god as a person but these are not scientific objections gg what do you think of richard dawkins s argument that , in any case , god won t do as an ultimate explanation of the universe \? his point is that complexity requires explanation the whole idea of evolution by natural selection is to explain the origin of complex lifeforms from less complex lifeforms but a creator god with enormous knowledge and power would have to be at least as complex as the universe he creates such a creator would require explanation by something else and so couldn t explain , for example , why there s something rather than nothing mr like every firstyear undergraduate in philosophy , dawkins thinks he can put to rest the causal argument for god s existence if god caused the world , then what caused god \? of course the great philosophers , anselm and aquinas particularly , are way ahead of him here they know that the only way to stop the regression is by making god something that needs no cause he must be a necessary being this means that god is not part of the regular causal chain but in some sense orthogonal to it he is what keeps the whole business going , past , present and future , and is the explanation of why there is something rather than nothing also god is totally simple , and i don t see why complexity should not arise out of this , just as it does in mathematics and science from very simple premises traditionally , god s necessity is not logical necessity but some kind of metaphysical necessity , or aseity unlike hume , i don t think this is a silly or incoherent idea , any more than i think mathematical platonism is silly or incoherent as it happens , i am not a mathematical platonist , and i do have conceptual difficulties with the idea of metaphysical necessity so in the end , i am not sure that the christian god idea flies , but i want to extend to christians the courtesy of arguing against what they actually believe , rather than begin and end with the polemical parody of what dawkins calls the god delusion gg do you think that evolution lends support to the atheistic argument from evil that it makes no sense to think that an allgood , allpowerful god would have used so wasteful and brutal a process as evolution to create living things \? mr although in some philosophy of religion circles it is now thought that we can counter the argument from evil , i don t think this is so more than that , i don t want it to be so i don t want an argument that convinces me that the death under the guillotine of sophie scholl \( one of the leaders of the white rose group opposed to the nazis \) or of anne frank in bergenbelsen ultimately contributes to the greater good if my eternal salvation depends on the deaths of these two young women , then forget it this said , i have never really thought that the pains brought on by the evolutionary process , in particular the struggle for survival and reproduction , much affect the christian conception of god for all of voltaire s devastating wit in candide , i am a bit of a leibnizian on these matters if god is to do everything through unbroken law , and i can think of good theological reasons why this should be so , then pain and suffering are part of it all paradoxically and humorously i am with dawkins here he argues that the only way naturally you can get the designlike features of organisms the hand and the eye is through evolution by natural selection , brought on by the struggle other mechanisms just don t work so god is off the hook gg what do you think of the claim that evolutionary accounts show that religion emerged not because of any evidence for its truth but because of its adaptive value \? mr it is interesting that you ask this question because recently i ve found myself wrestling with this issue more than just about any other as an ardent darwinian evolutionist i think that all organisms , and i include us humans , are the end product of a long , slow process of development thanks to the causal mechanism of natural selection so this means that i think features like the eye and the hand are around because of their adaptive value they help us to survive and reproduce gg of course , evolutionary explanations are empirically well established on the biological level but is the same true on the level of social and cultural life , especially among humans \? mr i include society and culture here although i would qualify what i say i don t see being a nazi as very adaptive , but i would say that the things that led to being a nazi for instance being open to indoctrination as a child have adaptive significance i would say the same of religion the biologist edward o wilson thinks that religion is adaptive because it promotes bonding and he might be right but it can go biologically haywire , as in the case of the shakers , whose religious prohibition on procreation had an adaptive value of precisely zero so it is true that in a sense i see all knowledge , including claims about religious knowledge , as being relative to evolutionary ends the upshot is that i don t dismiss religious beliefs even though they ultimately can be explained by evolution i think everything can ! i wouldn t dismiss religious beliefs even if you could show me that they are just a byproduct of adaptation , as i think darwin himself thought it is as plausible that my love of mozart s operas is a byproduct of adaptation , but it doesn t make them any the less beautiful and meaningful i think you have to judge religion on its merits gg is one of religion s merits that it provides a foundation \( intellectual and practical \) for morality through the idea of god as divine lawgiver \? mr i am on record as an evolutionary skeptic i don t deny substantive morality you ought to return your library books on time but i do deny objective foundations i think morality is a collective illusion , genetic in origin , that makes us good cooperators and i would add that being good cooperators makes each one of us individually better off in the struggle for existence if we are nice to other people , they are much more likely to be nice to us in return however , as the philosopher jl mackie used to argue , i think we objectify substantive ethics we think it objectively the case that we ought return library books on time but we do this \( or rather our genes make us do this \) because if we didn t we would all start to cheat and substantive ethics would collapse to the ground so i don t buy the moral argument for the existence of god i think you can have all of the morality you need without god i am a follower of hume brought up to date by darwin morality is purely emotions , although emotions of a special kind with an important adaptive function i don t , however , think that here i am necessarily denying the existence of god were i a christian , i would be somewhat of a natural law theorist , thinking that morality is what is natural caring about small children is natural and good killing small children for laughs is unnatural and bad if you want to say that god created the world and what is good therefore is what fits with the way god designed it , i am ok with this in fact , i think you should say it to avoid the problem \( raised in plato s euthyphro \) of simply making the good a function of god s arbitrary will gg there seems to be a tension in your thinking about religion you aren t yourself a believer , but you spend a great deal of time defending belief against its critics mr people often accuse me of being contradictory , if not of outright hypocrisy i won t say i accept the ontological argument for the existence of god the argument that derives god s existence from his essence but i do like it \( it is so clever \) and i am prepared to stand up for it when dawkins dismisses it with scorn rather than good reasons in part this is a turf war i am a professional philosopher i admire immensely thinkers like anselm and descartes and am proud to be one of them , however minor and inadequate in comparison i am standing up for my own in part , this is political religion is a big thing in america , and often not a very good big thing i don t think you are going to counter the bad just by going over the top , like in the battle of the somme i think you have to reach out over noman s land to the trenches on the other side and see where we can agree and hope to move forward i should say that my quaker childhood as in everything i do and think is tremendously important here i grew up surrounded by gentle , loving \( and very intelligent \) christians i never forget that finally , i just don t like bad arguments in my case , i think i can offer good arguments against the existence of the christian god i don t need the inadequate and faulty in murder in the cathedral , ts eliot has thomas becket say , the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reason amen this interview was conducted by email and edited previous interviews in this series were with , , , , , and  gary gutting is a professor of philosophy at the university of notre dame , and an editor of he is the author of , most recently , thinking the impossible french philosophy since 1960 and writes regularly for the stone
denver five months after colorado became the first state to allow recreational marijuana sales , the battle over legalization is still raging law enforcement officers in colorado and neighboring states , emergency room doctors and legalization opponents increasingly are highlighting a series of recent problems as cautionary lessons for other states flirting with loosening marijuana laws there is the denver man who , hours after buying a package of marijuanainfused karma kandy from one of colorado s new recreational marijuana shops , began raving about the end of the world and then pulled a handgun from the family safe and killed his wife , the authorities say some hospital officials say they are treating growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana sheriffs in neighboring states complain about stoned drivers streaming out of colorado and through their towns i think , by any measure , the experience of colorado has not been a good one unless you 're in the marijuana business , said kevin a sabet , executive director of smart approaches to marijuana , which opposes legalization we 've seen lives damaged we 've seen deaths directly attributed to marijuana legalization we 've seen marijuana slipping through colorado s borders we 've seen marijuana getting into the hands of kids despite such anecdotes , there is scant hard data because of the lag in reporting many health statistics , it may take years to know legal marijuana s effect if any on teenage drug use , school expulsions or the number of fatal car crashes it was only in january , for example , that the colorado state patrol began tracking the number of people pulled over for driving while stoned since then , marijuanaimpaired drivers have made up about 125 percent of all citations for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol proponents of legalization argue that the critics are cherrypicking anecdotes to tarnish a young industry that has been flourishing under intense scrutiny the vast majority of the state s medical and recreational marijuana stores are living up to stringent state rules , they say the stores have sold marijuana to hundreds of thousands of customers without incident the industry has generated 126 million in taxes and fees so far , though the revenues have not matched some early projections marijuana supporters note that violent crimes in denver where the bulk of colorado s pot retailers are are down so far this year the number of robberies from january through april fell by 48 percent from the same time in 2013 , and assaults were down by 37 percent over all , crime in denver is down by about 10 percent , though it is impossible to say whether changes to marijuana laws played any role in that decline every major institution said this would be horrible and lead to violence and blood in the streets , said brian vicente , one of the authors of amendment 64 , which legalized marijuana in colorado none of that s happened the sky did not fall the argument is being waged with fervor because both sides say colorado s successes and failures with regulating marijuana will shape perceptions of legalization for voters considering similar measures in other states and for leery federal law enforcement officials after the 2012 legalization votes in colorado and washington state where recreational sales are expected to begin this summer justice department officials gave the states a cautious green light but they warned that they might intervene if marijuana ended up fueling violence or drug trafficking , or flowing across state lines or into the hands of children marijuana opponents like thomas j gorman of the rocky mountain high intensity drug trafficking area program , which helps law enforcement , say colorado is already falling short of those standards in any other state if they were making as much money and growing as much dope , they 'd be taken out by the feds , mr gorman said few agree on how much legally purchased marijuana is being secreted out of colorado michele leonhart , the head of the drug enforcement administration , told a senate panel in april that officials in kansas had tallied a 61 percent increase in seizures of marijuana that could be traced to colorado but according to the kansas highway patrol , total marijuana seizures fell to 1 , 090 pounds from 2 , 790 pounds during the first four months of the year , a 61 percent decline some sheriffs and police chiefs along colorado s borders say they have noticed little change but in colby , kan , which sits along an interstate highway running west to colorado , police chief ron alexander said charges for sale , distribution or possession related to marijuana were rising fast this year , he tallied 20 such cases through may 23 two years ago , there were six during that same time period sheriff adam hayward of deuel county , neb , said he was locking up more people for marijuanarelated offenses it s kind of a freeforall , he said the state or the federal government needs to step up and do something criminal marijuana cases in colorado plunged by 65 percent in 2013 , the first full year of legalization for personal recreational use , but the police in some areas have been writing dozens of tickets to crack down on public marijuana smokers police and fire officials across the state have been contending with a sharp rise in home explosions , as people use flammable butane to make hashish oil and despite a galaxy of legal , regulated marijuana stores across the state , prosecutors say a dangerous illicit market persists in february , for example , in the denver suburb of aurora , a 17yearold planning to rob an outofstate marijuana buyer instead accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend , law enforcement officials said why break into a house to steal a tv or a computer that you have to fence when you can steal mounds of cash or marijuana , which is like liquid \? said george brauchler , the district attorney who oversees aurora that s the kind of stuff we 're starting to become more aware of many of colorado s starkest problems with legal marijuana stem from potinfused cookies , chocolates and other surprisingly potent edible treats that are especially popular with tourists and casual marijuana users on colorado s northern plains , for example , a fourth grader showed up on the playground one day in april and sold some of his grandmother s marijuana to three classmates the next day , one of those students returned the favor by bringing in a marijuana edible he had swiped from his own grandmother this was kind of an unintended consequence of colorado s new law , said john gates , the district s director of school safety and security for crying out loud , secure your weed if you can legally possess it , that s fine but it has no place in an elementary school so far this year , nine children have ended up at children s hospital colorado in aurora after consuming marijuana , six of whom got critically sick in all of 2013 , the hospital treated only eight such cases in march , the state logged what appeared to be its first death directly tied to legal recreational marijuana when a 19yearold african exchange student , levy thamba pongi , plunged to his death in denver he and three other students had driven from their college in wyoming to sample colorado s newly legal wares mr pongi ate marijuanainfused cookies , began acting wildly and leapt from a hotel balcony , officials said the medical examiner s office said marijuana intoxication had made a significant contribution to the accident in april , the shooting death of kristine kirk raised even more concerns about regulating edible marijuana minutes before she was killed , ms kirk called 911 to say her husband , richard , was talking like it was the end of the world and had consumed marijuana and possibly prescription medication for back pain , according to a police affidavit police later confirmed that mr kirk had bought the karma kandy and a prerolled joint from a licensed marijuana shop that evening those two deaths , combined with reports of groggy , nauseated children visiting emergency rooms , forced the state to tighten its labeling and packaging rules for edible marijuana regulators are also considering whether to set lower limits on the amount of thc , the psychoactive component of marijuana , that can be packed into one cookie or chocolate bonbon even supporters of legalization such as mr vicente say colorado needs to pass stricter rules about edible marijuana he said the state was racing up a sharp learning curve marijuana was illegal for 80 years , mr vicente said now it s legal , and everyone s just trying to figure out how to approach these new issues
sepang , malaysia as the hunt for the missing malaysia airlines jet expanded into the vastness of the indian ocean , a satellite communications company confirmed on friday that it had recorded electronic keep alive ping signals from the plane after it disappeared , and said those signals could be analyzed to help estimate its location the information from the company , , could prove to be a valuable break in the frustrating search for the plane with 239 people aboard that mysteriously disappeared from radar screens a week ago , now hunted by a multinational array of ships and planes that have fanned out for thousands of square miles until now , that search has turned up false leads oil slicks , chunks of foam , life vests and other debris unconnected to the vanished plane but a series of electronic pings sent by the aircraft could help the search , which is shifting focus from the confines of the gulf of thailand and nearby waters to include the indian ocean on the western side of malaysia investigators also are looking at the possibility that a shipment of lithium batteries in the cargo hold may have caught fire and felled the aircraft a senior american official who had been briefed on the contents listed on the plane s cargo manifest said a significant load of lithium batteries had been aboard raising suspicions because of previous cargoplane crashes attributed to lithium battery shipments , which can overheat and cause intense fires but that possibility is inconsistent with information that the plane may have kept flying for hours after it vanished news reports that malaysian military radar may have tracked the plane , a boeing 777 , turning from its original route to cut across the malaysian peninsula and head west toward the indian ocean before vanishing last saturday have drawn growing anger from china , the country from which nearly twothirds of the passengers originated if the aircraft did divert so drastically from its planned route , any traces of it captured by satellites and military radar will become all the more important david coiley , a vice president of inmarsat , a british satellite telecommunications provider , said the missing plane had been equipped with an inmarsat signaling system that sends out a keepalive message to establish that the plane s communications system is still switched on the plane sent out a series of such messages after civilian radar lost contact , he said those messages later stopped , but he declined to specify precisely when or how many messages had been received mr coiley said inmarsat was sharing the information with the airline and investigators it does allow us to determine where the airplane is relative to the satellite , he said of the signal , which he likened to the noises you might hear when a cellphone sits next to a radio or a television speaker he said it does allow us to narrow down the position of the aircraft at the moment when the signal was sent such equipment automatically checks in to satellites , much as a mobile phone would check in to a network after passing through a mountain tunnel , he said because the pings go over a measurable distance at a specific angle to one of the company s satellites , the information can be used to help calculate the trajectory of an aircraft and narrow its approximate location though not necessarily its resting point communications systems are part of the mandatory requirement for operating any flight , and we are comfortable that it would have been operating accordingly , mr coiley said increasingly , the search has encompassed seas to the west of the malaysian peninsula , stretching from the strait of malacca to the bay of bengal , where the united states and india sent military planes and ships the move came in tandem with an increasing amount of evidence that the aircraft flew for four hours after it disappeared from air traffic control radar after 1 am last saturday even with the potential help of the inmarsat data , the new focus on the open ocean illustrates the difficulty for the multinational search force , which now must scan thousands of miles of the world s thirdlargest ocean the initial search area was in the relatively confined and shallow waters of the south china sea and gulf of thailand , which are among the world s busiest maritime routes if the plane ended up in the ocean depths , it will be far harder to find and recover at a news conference , the malaysian defense minister , hishammuddin hussein , who has been the chief public face of his government s search effort , said that searching seas both to the east and west of his country was a logical next step after days of fruitless searching and false starts but he also acknowledged that , seven days after it vanished , an aircraft with 239 passengers and crew aboard remains unaccounted for , leaving family members in tormented wait a normal investigation becomes narrower with time , i understand , as new information focuses on the search , said mr hishammuddin , who is also acting transport minister but this is not a normal investigation he said the multinational search had expanded on both sides of malaysia , into the south china sea , and increasingly into the indian ocean it is basically because we have not found anything in the areas that we have searched , he said but aviation experts , news reports and some american officials have also pointed to military radar and signals collected by satellites as furnishing stronger evidence that the boeing 777 plane turned sharply from its planned course , flew over the malaysian peninsula and then headed west toward the andaman sea and the indian ocean a report from the reuters news agency on friday said that information culled from military radar records indicated that the plane may have been deliberately flown far off its intended route , from kuala lumpur to beijing , and when last recorded was heading toward the andaman islands , which belong to india the report added weight to some theories that the aircraft may have been hijacked other information , however , has suggested nothing suspicious an american counterterrorism official said friday that american authorities had gone through each of the passengers and crew members on the manifest including the two iranians with stolen passports and none had any known links to terrorist or other extremist groups the multinational effort was scattered across the northern reaches of the indian ocean indian military forces continued their efforts friday to find traces of the airplane in the andaman sea , to the west of thailand , and expanded the search to the area west of nicobar island in the bay of bengal the search in the indian ocean includes ships , planes and nearly 1 , 000 personnel from india s navy , coast guard and air force a spokesman for the indian navy refused on friday to offer an estimate of how long the search might take how can you ask such a question \? said the spokesman , capt d k sharma this is like looking for a needle in that vast expanse of sea the chinese government announced that the haixun 31 , a civilian patrol ship that has been the command vessel for china s contingent in the search , would move from the gulf of thailand to the strait of malacca , on the other side of the peninsula a report on chinese state television news said a group of experts had advised the chinese maritime search and rescue center to expand the scope of the search on friday the united states navy continued its maritime aircraft patrols , focusing on the area to the west of malaysia , said cmdr william marks , spokesman for the seventh fleet the navy s new p8a poseidon patrol craft arrived on friday , he said the aircraft , built with the airframe of a boeing 737 , has a range of more than 1 , 300 miles and can search vast areas of ocean india on thursday said it was also deploying its own variant of the aircraft , the p8i , as well as the c130j hercules and other aircraft the difficulty , commander marks said in an interview , was that the area is best patrolled by aircraft , but ships and helicopters are capable of more thorough and intense searches everything is a tradeoff i think the challenge is the sheer size of the area , commander marks said
president obama is going to visit the pope ! he s been to the vatican before , but not with pope , who is perhaps the only person in the world almost everybody likes except rush limbaugh , which sort of makes it even better the president s visit , which is scheduled for march , comes at an interesting intersection in the two men s careers pope francis can currently do no wrong , and barack obama can do no right recently , his administration decided to move its vatican embassy into a more secure building , and the outcry was so intense that you 'd think obama had ordered a recreation of the sack of rome a slap in the face to the 78 million catholics in the united states , one congressman screeched why would our president close our embassy to the vatican \? twittered jeb bush hopefully , it is not retribution for catholic organizations opposing obamacare as political tweets go , this is a keeper on two counts first , we can once again marvel at republican politicians' ability to insert the affordable care act into everything \( coming soon how the individual mandate robbed oprah winfrey of an oscar nomination \) second , we can mark the official end of the former governor of florida s career as the safe , sane fallback option in 2016 but about the vatican embassy the state department has been trying to move it into a compound that includes the american embassy to italy this will save money and improve security instantly , certain parties detected a plot two former ambassadors to the vatican , ray flynn \( clinton \) and jim nicholson \( bush \) , penned a blistering oped for the wall street journal in which they called the move a colossal mistake that would squish the holy see s separate identity diplomatically , they attributed more intense feelings to others \( many have seen the move as a deliberate slap at the catholic church and the pope some may even detect veiled anticatholicism \) fastforward to many variations on the headline obama insults catholics the state department pointed out that the new quarters would be in an entirely different building , with an entirely different entrance than the italian embassy and that while the new embassy will not be in the vatican , neither is the current one or that of any other country the vatican is only twotenths of a square mile , and more than half of that is gardens in fact , our new location is a tenth of a mile closer , said under secretary of state patrick kennedy it s a clear diminishment of the importance of the holy see post , said nicholson cynics might wonder why we have an embassy for the vatican in the first place the total population is about 800 people , which is approximately oneeighth the seating capacity of radio city music hall it has virtually none of the attributes you find in an actual country it does n't even have a cuisine but , obviously , nobody is going to disrespect the vatican while pope francis is around he won the world s heart by quickly doing a few things that were so obvious , it s amazing no previous pontiff figured them out such as if you are going to talk about the poor all the time , you should try to avoid gold furniture without changing any of the church s reactionary rules on contraception , homosexuality or abortion , francis changed the tone just by saying that catholics should stop obsessing about sex i cannot imagine what the nuns who ran my old high school would have thought about that theory really , it s hard to overestimate what an incredible timesaver this is and instead of just pleading for greater charity toward the poor , francis decreed that the world needed to drop the idea that when the rich got richer , everybody eventually benefited trickledown economics amounted to a crude and na ve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power this would have been where he lost rush limbaugh ken langone , the billionaire cofounder of home depot , told cardinal timothy dolan that a rich benefactor to a rebuilding project at st patrick s cathedral in new york might hesitate to cough up his promised milliondollar donation because of the pope s attitude cardinal dolan said he assured langone that while the pope loves the poor , he also loves rich people republican budget guru representative paul ryan said the pope s apparent lack of enthusiasm for the capitalist system was due to an unfortunate upbringing the guy is from argentina they have n't had real capitalism in argentina , he told the milwaukee journal sentinel even if francis was down on capitalism , no capitalists wanted to sound down on francis meanwhile , president obama has spent the last five years dodging calls for new taxes and protecting the insurance industry from health care reform stocks have been at an alltime high , and wall street hates him the moral is it s way easier to be pope
if you 're closing in on 50 but want to feel much , much older , teach a college course i'm doing that now , at 49 , and hardly a class goes by when i do n't make an allusion that prompts my students to stare at me as if i just dropped in from the paleozoic era last week i mentioned the movie they shoot horses , do n't they \? only one of the 16 students had heard of it i summarized its significance , riffling through the depression , with which they were familiar , and jane fonda s career , with which they were n't barbarella went sailing over their heads i did n't dare test my luck with talk of leg warmers and ted turner i once brought up vanessa redgrave blank stares greta garbo ditto we were a few minutes into a discussion of an essay that repeatedly invoked proust s madeleine when i realized that almost none of the students understood what the madeleine signified or , for that matter , who this proust fellow was and these are young women and men bright and diligent enough to have gained admission to princeton university , which is where our disconnect is playing out the bulk of that disconnect , obviously , is generational seemingly all of my students know who gwyneth paltrow is and with another decade or two of reading and living and being subjected to fossils like me , they 'll assemble a richer inventory of knowledge and trivia , not all of it presentday but the pronounced narrowness of the cultural terrain that they and i share the precise limits of the overlap suggests something additional at work in a wired world with hundreds of television channels , countless byways in cyberspace and all sorts of technological advances that permit each of us to customize his or her diet of entertainment and information , are common points of reference dwindling \? has the personal niche supplanted the public square \? both literally and figuratively , the socalled watercooler show is fading fast , a reality underscored by a fact that i stumbled across in of the new yorker in the mid1970s , when the sitcom all in the family was america s toprated television series , more than 50 million people would tune in to a given episode that was in a country of about 215 million i checked on the no 1 series for the 201213 television season an episode of which typically drew fewer than 22 million people , even counting those who watched a recording of it within a week of its broadcast that s out of nearly 318 million americans now ncis competes against an unprecedented bounty of original programming and more ways to see new and old shows than ever , what with cable networks , subscription services , youtube , apple tv and aereo that it was jumping into the fray and , like netflix and amazon , would develop its own shows in movies , there s a bevy of boutique fare that never even opens in theaters but that you can order on demand at home in music , streaming services and internet and satellite radio stations showcase a dizzying array of songs and performers , few of whom attain widespread recognition in books , selfpublishing has contributed to a marked rise in the number of titles , but it does n't take an especially large crowd of readers for a book to become a best seller everyone s on a different page with so very much to choose from , a person can stick to one or two preferred microgenres and subsist entirely on them , while other people gorge on a completely different set of ingredients you like housewives \? savor them in multiple cities and accents food porn \? stuff yourself silly vampire fiction \? the vein never runs dry i brought up this balkanization of experience with hendrik hartog , the director of the american studies program at princeton , and he noted that what s happening in popular culture mirrors what has transpired at many elite universities , where survey courses in literature and history have given way to meditations on more focused themes there s enormous weight given to specialized knowledge , he said it leaves an absence of connective tissue for students not for nothing , he observed , does his princeton colleague daniel rodgers , an emeritus professor of history , call this the age of fracture it has enormous upsides , and may be for the best no single , potentially alienating cultural dogma holds sway a person can find an individual lens and language through which his or her world comes alive and because makers of commercial entertainment do n't have to chase an increasingly apocryphal mass audience , they can produce cultish gems , like girls on hbo and louie on fx but each fosters a separate dialect finding a collective vocabulary becomes harder although i'm tempted to tell my students that they make me feel like the 2 , 000yearold man , i wo n't i might have to fill them in first on mel brooks
london overindulgence in food and drink has long been one of the hazards of political life for members of britain s parliament but no longer abstemiousness seems to be the order of the day but while the new sobriety may be good for lawmakers' family lives , waistlines and general health , it has cut the revenues that support the 19thcentury , home to the house of lords and the house of commons , not to speak of numerous watering holes and other gathering spots this has prompted an unlikely fundraising effort the authorities at parliament have decided to rent out some of its gorgeous premises to keep the building in shape in the past , after long hours in parliament , a stiff drink at the palace was considered essential , whether celebratory or consoling but politicians are toning it down these days , and with fewer lawmakers staying late into the night , the authorities are now renting out 15 underused dining halls and tearooms to businesses and organizations to raise money there are more members of parliament leading a monastic lifestyle at the moment , said paul flynn , a veteran labour legislator and the author of a tongueincheek selfhelp book for new members they 're so consumed with guilt and scandal that they become neurotic about behaving properly , so they have a cup of coke at night , read some evening press and then go to their chaste beds , he said in an interview the authorities at the house of commons say the palace needs at least 65 million a year just for maintenance , and it is already licensed to hold weddings legislators ca n't be demanding greater efficiency from the public at a time of austerity if parliament itself is immune to seeking the same , said thomas docherty , another labour lawmaker , who sits on the house of commons administration committee this is us doing our small bit the committee said it had received a small number of applications since the initiative began in late december none have been approved yet , but demand is expected to increase room charges range from 1 , 650 to nearly 15 , 000 for a full day , or from 450 to 7 , 500 for an evening discounts are available for charities the unelected house of lords has no similar plans but the decision to unburden taxpayers of the upkeep of historic public sites may now extend even to buckingham palace last october , the palace , queen elizabeth s london residence , was rented by the chief executive of jpmorgan chase , jamie dimon , for a dinner hosted by the duke of york to entertain the bank s clients on tuesday , when it was revealed that the queen s household budget had dwindled to about 25 million , 87 lawmakers urged the royal household to open up the palace to more visitors to help defray maintenance costs westminster palace , with its gilded neogothic spires and vaults by the river thames , is best known for its landmark clock tower , known as big ben , and neighboring westminster abbey the palace was built on the remains of a medieval palace destroyed by a fire in 1834 the palace is listed by unesco as a world heritage site , and for decades it has charged tourists for guided tours companies and corporate executives have been able to hold events there if they were sponsored by members of parliament , but the new initiative formalizes the process , and applications are now approved by the committee , not by individual lawmakers the idea is to remove potential conflicts of interest among the facilities up for rent is the pugin room , named after augustus pugin , a 19thcentury architect best known for reviving the gothic style in britain he designed most of the palace s interiors , down to the doorknobs a chandelier dominates the room , with a portrait of pugin on one wall champagne is on offer , as well as homemade scones and rich fruitcake , giving it that slightly dissipatedattheedges air about it , said mr flynn , the labour lawmaker major events are celebrated there , but the room is also well suited for romantic encounters , which are rife at parliament , he said one female politician , he said , was known to have converted to roman catholicism after meetings with her priest over copious amounts of red wine there the churchill dining room features landscapes churchill painted then there are the strangers' dining room and the members' dining room , named to separate visitors from legislators both have the air of a great room in a castle , decorated with wooden carvings of game , flowers and fruit against mossgreen wallpaper guests can be treated to house of commons champagne at 65 a bottle and a menu featuring slowbraised cinnamon lamb shank , panfried supreme of gressingham duck and sticky ginger and guinness spongecake you can sit there and think , well , winston churchill used to sit in that corner , and aneurin bevan , ' who founded the national health service , in the other corner , mr flynn said he recalled margaret thatcher , as prime minister , arriving and asking a group of tories if she could join them for dinner who could disagree \? he said going down the ages , these great people have been sitting there and enjoying it not everyone welcomes the changes kevin brennan , a labour legislator , said that bankers and financial institutions should be excluded from renting the sites we have managed to survive as a parliament for several hundreds of years without having to hire ourselves out to the very commercial interests , in some cases , who have caused the austerity , he said in a november debate it would be ironic , would n't it , if the bankers were sipping champagne in the people s parliament to raise money because of the damage they caused \? he said , adding , i believe that is a line we should not cross peter york , a social commentator , asked , what next , the jpmorgan palace of westminster \? the concept is too much like lobbying , he said in an interview if it does n't happen in congress , the global capital of capitalism , it should n't happen here but john thurso , a liberal democrat legislator and a former businessman who sits on the administration committee , said the initiative was a way to bring parliament into the 21st century being businesslike , both in the way we individually conduct ourselves as members and in the way the house of commons is run , is important , he said my job today is to make sure that we work in a sober , honest and godly fashion , and i'm doing my best to ensure that
if you want to cut to the heart of what s gone wrong in the republican party over the last two presidential cycles , you could do worse than start with this post from the liberal blogger kevin drum , lamenting the weakness of his own party s pitch to working and middle class voters why is it that the working class often votes against its own economic interests \? well , let s compare the sales pitches of the republican and democratic parties when it comes to pocketbook issues republicans we will lower your taxes democrats we , um , support policies that encourage a fairer distribution of growth and and working man party of fdr um there are two problems with the democratic approach first , it s too abstract to appeal to anyone second , it s not true anyway democrats simply don t consistently support concrete policies that help the broad working and middle classes sure , democrats do plenty for the poor but virtually none of this really benefits the working or middle classes except at the margins this is a strong claim , especially coming from a liberal , and the policy examples that drum offers to support his case offer plenty for both left and right to contest but i want to focus on his framing of the republican party s pitch , because while it s an accurateenough summary of the reaganera party s message , we will lower your taxes is precisely what republicans conspicuously didn t say to middle and working class voters or at least didn t say clearly and often while going down to defeat in 2008 and 2012 in those election cycles , instead of countering the rhetoric of redistribution with the promise of higher takehome pay , conservatives basically alternated between proposing fanciful tax reforms \( in the flat tax fair tax 999 mode \) that would probably raise taxes on the working class , and proposing somewhat more serious tax reforms that plowed most of the savings from cleaning out the tax code into creating the lowest possible top rate the romney campaign took the latter tack , and ended up wasting precious time in the waning days of the presidential race trying to prove that its tax reform wasn t actually a middleclass tax increase an absurd position for the antitax party s candidate to end up in , but there you are that remarkable political failure is useful context for thinking about the various tax proposals emerging of late from a suddenly reformminded gop the tax plan offered recently by house ways and means chairman dave camp , which attracted praise not only from conservative policy writers but wonder of wonders new york magazine s jonathan chait as well , is basically what the romney plan would have been if romney had a clearer sense of how to use policy to play against his plutocratic caricature it has the basic ratelowering , deductioncapping , loopholeclosing , progrowth framework that most rightofcenter economists tend to favor , but its specifics are deliberately populist , goring some wall street oxes that republicans usually protect \( as well as plenty of other deserving interest groups , including a certain hedge fund with a sideline in elite education \) , setting the top tax rate at 35 percent rather than romney s moreimplausible 28 percent , and using the savings to explicitly promise lower taxes for the middle and working class camp himself estimates , pretty credibly , that his reform would leave a medianincome family of four with an extra 1 , 300 in their pocket at the end of the year , which is a more populist and a more reaganite promise than his party has generally made on taxes recently the political question is whether this kind of blueprint can get any traction post2014 \( nothing s happening before the midterms \) , and particularly whether it might be embraced in any form by the jockeying 2016 candidates the policy question , though , is whether the gop could plausibly deliver something bigger to middle america by cutting payroll taxes directly , for instance , as the washington examiner s philip klein suggested in his comments on the camp plan , or by pursuing a version of senator mike lee s child tax credit expansion , which is at the heart of lee s own reform proposal from last fall the trouble with going bigger , of course , is that the money has to come from somewhere , and the recent tax policy center score of lee s proposal suggests that in the first draft , at least the offsets aren t there his plan appears to cut taxes for at least some middle class families more substantially than camp s , but it ends up falling 24 trillion short of revenue neutrality over ten years , which is not exactly small beer \( the deficitheavy score was a great mercy for chait , since it spared him from having to concede the merits of two gop proposals in a single month \) that shortfall is not inherent to the child tax credit expansion , however the lee plan repeals obamacare s tax increases , which could be addressed in the context of a health care overhaul instead it doesn t really take on corporate and investment taxes and as the tpc notes , its twobracket structure \( 15 percent and 35 percent \) could be amended , either with a different phasein for the top rate or an additional bracket , in ways that could raise sufficient revenue to close most of the gap in addition , in lee s plan the expanded child tax credit doesn t phase out with income , so the proposal ends up delivers a bigger tax cut for upperincome families than the camp plan with a phaseout on the tax credit , the fiscal costs could presumably be significantly reduced the liberal response to the lee plan s disappointing score , from chait and others , has been to suggest that it illustrates the continuing unrealism of gop proposals but notably , lee himself didn t respond by , say , denouncing tpc and insisting that some version of dynamic scoring would make the deficit numbers come out right he responded by announcing that he was partnering with marco rubio \( cough , 2016 , cough \) to develop a revised familyfriendly proposal so there s the possibility for evolution here , potentially by the time the next presidential campaign arrives , the gop could still be groping in the policy darkness but between the camp blueprint and the initial lee proposal , it has two rough drafts that could both influence a genuinely populist finished product one that actually answers liberalism s obamaera pitch , and lets republicans get back to making the kind of promises on taxes that used to win them elections , once upon a time
paris one of the maddening things about being a foreigner in france is that hardly anyone in the rest of the world knows what s really happening here they think paris is a socialist museum where people are exceptionally good at eating small bits of chocolate and tying scarves in fact , the french have all kinds of worthwhile ideas on larger matters this occurred to me recently when i was strolling through my museumlike neighborhood in central paris , and realized there were i kid you not seven bookstores within a 10minute walk of my apartment granted , i live in a bookish area but still do the french know something about the book business that we americans do n't \? i was in a bookstorecounting mood because of the news that amazon has delayed or stopped delivering some books , over its dispute with the publisher hachette this has prompted soulsearching over amazon s 41 percent share of new book sales in america and its 65 percent share of new books sold online for a few bucks off and the pleasure of shopping from bed , have we handed over a precious natural resource our nation s books to an ambitious billionaire with an engineering degree \? france , meanwhile , has just unanimously passed a socalled law , which says online sellers ca n't offer free shipping on discounted books \( it will be either cheese or dessert , not both at once , a french commentator explained \) the new measure is part of france s effort to promote bibliodiversity and help independent bookstores compete here , there s no big bookseller with the power to suddenly turn off the spigot people in the industry estimate that amazon has a 10 or 12 percent share of new book sales in france amazon reportedly handles 70 percent of the country s online book sales , but just 18 percent of books are sold online the french secret is deeply unamerican fixed book prices its 1981 lang law , named after former culture minister jack lang , says that no seller can offer more than 5 percent off the cover price of new books that means a book costs more or less the same wherever you buy it in france , even online the lang law was designed to make sure france continues to have lots of different books , publishers and booksellers fixing book prices may sound shocking to americans , but it s common around the world , for the same reason in germany , retailers are n't allowed to discount most books at all six of the world s 10 biggest bookselling countries germany , japan , france , italy , spain and south korea have  even with the state s help , french bookstores are struggling xavier moni , coowner of comme un roman in paris , says he can afford to give 5 percent off only every 10th purchase more important than free shipping , he and others say , is that despite having extensive operations in france and elsewhere in europe , amazon pays taxes in luxembourg , where corporate taxes are effectively low and in some cases largely avoidable the european union has begun an inquiry into amazon s taxes still , there does seem to be a link between fixed book prices and flourishing or at least stillbreathing independent bookstores in britain , which abandoned its own fixedprice system in the 1990s , there are fewer than 1 , 000 independent bookstores left a third closed in the past nine years , as supermarkets and amazon discounted some books by more than 50 percent you 'd have to be almost masochistic to go into a bookseller in the uk to buy a best seller , dougal thomson of the international publishers association says what underlies france s book laws is n't just an economic position it s also a worldview quite simply , the french treat books as special some 70 percent of french people said they read at least one book last year the average among french readers was 15 books readers say they trust books far more than any other medium , including newspapers and tv the french government classifies books as an essential good , along with electricity , bread and water \( a french friend of mine runs a charity , libraries without borders , which brings books to survivors of natural disasters \) we do n't force french people to go to bookstores , explains vincent montagne , head of the french publishers association they go to bookstores because they read none of this is taken for granted people here have thought for centuries about what makes a book industry vibrant , and are watching developments in britain and america as cautionary tales we do n't sell potatoes , says mr moni there are also ideas in books that s what s dangerous because the day that you have a large seller that sells 80 percent of books , he s the one who will decide what s published , or what wo n't be published that s what scares me the french are n't being pretentious or fetishizing bookstores they 're giving voice to something we know in america , too when your computer dies , you throw it away , says mr montagne of the publishers' association but you 'll remember a book 20 years later you 've deeply entered into a story that s not your own it s forged who you are you 'll only see later how much it has affected you you do n't keep all books , but it s not a market like others the contents of a bookcase can define who you are the main thing my bookcase says about me is that i'm not french while i love walking past those beautifully lit bookstores in my neighborhood , what i mostly buy there are blank notebooks and lastminute presents for children s birthdays online retailers are a godsend for stranded expatriates like people everywhere who are fretting about amazon s global domination , i want to have my g teau and eat it , too the option to buy online , but the pleasure of browsing in a shop and i do n't want every book purchase to feel like a political statement french people like having books delivered to their doorsteps , too , and they 're starting to read more ebooks \( which are currently just 3 percent of the book market \) indeed , despite all their oldfashioned bookstores , they are aiming for something that sounds quite american choice \( here they call it quilibre balance \) unlike us , they might actually get it
at one time were criticized for profligate spending , for overvaluing some of their players and awarding generous contracts to those whose production did not quite seem to merit the reward on friday they invested 5 million in a player they hope never takes a snap for them ideally , that is what happens with , whom they signed to a oneyear deal , for the going rate of a 33yearold who was the best quarterback available if vick does not play , that means geno smith will have continued to validate their decision to draft him last april , building on the progress he revealed toward the end of a turbulent rookie season you know , i mean i would n't say i would necessarily be ok with sitting on the bench all year , vick said in a conference call friday but i know what i signed up for i know what i came to new york to do first and foremost i came to compete and be a helping hand for geno , and he has a long way to go more than anything , the jets want to win but they want smith to succeed nearly as much they felt that way about mark sanchez , too , before releasing him on friday sanchez had plenty of shortcomings , but the jets were culpable in his decline , purging offensive talent and failing to provide him with a backup who threatened his primacy none of his backups from kellen clemens to kevin o'connell , mark brunell to tim tebow posed a credible threat , adding to the perception that sanchez was coddled there is a difference between infringing on the job security of a toptier quarterback and challenging someone who is still developing , someone like sanchez then , someone like smith now it is altogether possible for vick to mentor smith , to tutor him , while every day still approaching his job as if he will start just as it is possible that a player with stature , like vick , can provide legitimate competition without inviting the appearance that smith needs to be motivated to succeed earlier last week , coach told the jets' website that smith was going to be hard to beat out i do n't care who comes in here if smith is as mentally tough , as strongwilled and eager to learn as the team believes he is , then vick s presence will not inhibit his development teams that have not yet identified their franchise quarterback and the jets , despite their satisfaction with smith s improvement , are one of them are acting irresponsibly if they do not explore their options it makes sense to hope for the best but assume the worst , that injuries or ineffectiveness will strike the first possibility exists with vick , who has not played a full season since 2006 the second exists with smith , who is only slightly more of a proven commodity than he was a year ago regardless of how the competition unfolds , the jets as a whole are better equipped to deal with it than they were last season , or especially in 2012 , when they mismanaged the tebow experiment , a trade that caused irreparable harm to their quarterback hierarchy already in place for vick are a familiar scheme a coach , ryan , who adores him and a former offensive coordinator , marty mornhinweg , who has seen him at his best on saturday , smith told reporters in west virginia that he welcomed vick s arrival vick s my guy , he said we needed to find a guy that was legitimately a guy that could come in and play smith also said he had spoken to vick while preparing to transition from college to the nfl some of the things i asked him was , how did you deal with being guy \? ' smith said i was in that situation last year as soon as i walked into the locker room , i was expected to produce and as we all know in the league , it s hard to do that vick has rehabilitated his image after serving 18 months in federal prison for his role in an illegal operation , and he could be a daily reminder of the significance of behaving responsibly he is said to have been the consummate teammate in philadelphia , a valued lockerroom presence who did not grumble when , after returning from injury last season , he failed to reclaim the starting job from nick foles vick respected his coach s decision and supported foles it is not difficult to imagine the same situation occurring this summer if it does , if smith thrives with vick s support , then 5 million could seem like a bargain
london the last time that germany beat argentina to win the world cup , the coach , franz beckenbauer , said that once east and west germany became unified at the end of that year , no one would ever take the title off them beckenbauer was smiling that night in 1990 in rome his boast was meant to be taken lightheartedly it has taken 24 years for germany to become the world champion again twentyfour years , and a complete overhaul of the way that the united nation identifies talent and then coaches it from kindergarten on up with the singular aim of putting the national team back on top of the world the depth of germany s talent pool is such that mario g tze , whose beautiful goal won the final in rio de janeiro on sunday , became the first player to come off the bench to score the winning goal in a world cup final g tze s goal broke the impasse that took us perilously close to another wretched penalty shootout to decide the world champion and with that victory , germany ended the seemingly eternal fact that nothing but south american teams had ever won a world cup in the americas so thank heavens for g tze the coach joachim l w sent him in with , l w said , the instruction to show the world he was a better player than  g tze is a miracle boy , the coach told reporters after the game he can play in any position and has superior technical qualities i know he is able to decide a match , and he scored a great decider today he did indeed , with a wonderful , knowing movement as he darted into argentina s penalty area after andr sch rrle \( also a substitute \) made a dynamic burst down the left flank g tze s control of sch rrle s pass with his chest and then his sublime volley without even a glance to determine the goalkeeper s position were certainly superior techniques it raises a small question as to why l w made 82 million germans the united population suffer through an entire contest that could have ended much sooner had messi or gonzalo higua n or rodrigo palacio made the most of their chances for argentina but do n't let us be churlish l w has worked eight years \( 10 if your count his two years as an assistant to jurgen klinsmann , his predecessor \) for this fulfillment the confidence shown by german coaches in being able to identify talent at a young age , and then making the national team their priority , is a model for the rest of the world and , yes , there have been east german hands in this endeavor matthias sammer , a native of dresden in east germany , played a part in both the unification of the national team and the development of g tze sammer was perhaps the closest thing germany ever found to replacing beckenbauer with his ability to glide between defense and offense and before injuries curtailed sammer s career , he added 51 german caps to the 23 appearances he made for the east german national team when he needed a job , the german football association hired him as technical director in 2006 sammer s specific task was to guide the youth teams , from the ages of 11 to 18 , under the direction of l w g tze , born in bavaria but a product of borussia dortmund s coaching academy starting at age 8 , came under sammer s wing i specifically recall the east german identifying the young g tze as one of the best talents , ever , in germany and when sammer moved on from his national team role to become sports director at bayern munich , responsible for recruiting , he went after g tze the buyout clause in his dortmund contract cost about 50 million , an expensive welcome gift for pep guardiola when he took over as bayern s head coach a year ago by then , g tze was beginning to come of age at 21 guardiola has blended him , month by month , into the style that the coach brought from barcelona to be better than messi is more than a tall order something is wrong with the messi we have seen at this world cup the messi who emerged under the wing of guardiola at barcelona whether it is his hamstrings rebelling after so many seasons of relentless pressure , the sheer exhaustion of life for so long at the top , or something more serious , no one knows or if they know , no one is telling in any event , for fifa to hand him the player of the tournament prize is a strange , misguided sop messi had his inspired moments his goals and assists did carry argentina through the first stage of this event , but he faded later in the tournament as javier mascherano grew magnificently and tenaciously into the country s true leader during the world cup mascherano , along with his quiet and sometimes distastefully maligned coach , alejandro sabella , built an obdurate and reliable argentine defense , even though it appeared they had none at all when the event began it is thanks to argentina that , right to the end , the eclipse of south american soccer on its own continent was averted l w s last throw of the dice , putting in his game winner when everyone around and against him

uber , the popular carservice app that allows you to hail a cab from your smartphone , shows your assigned car as a moving dot on a map as it makes its way toward you it s reassuring , especially as you wait on a rainy street corner less reassuring , though , was the apparent threat from a senior vice president of uber to spend a million dollars looking into the personal lives of journalists who wrote critically about uber the problem was n't just that a representative of a powerful corporation was contemplating opposition research on reporters the problem was that uber already had sensitive data on journalists who used it for rides buzzfeed reported that rides taken by one of its own journalists and , the company was so lax about such sensitive data that it even allowed a job applicant to view people s rides , including those of a family member of a prominent politician \( the app is popular with members of congress , among others \) after the uber executive s statements , many took note of a 2012 post on the company s blog that boasted of how uber had tracked the rides of users who went somewhere other than home on friday or saturday nights , and left from the same address the next morning it identified these rides of glory as potential onenight stands \( the blog post was later removed \) uber had just told all its users that if they were having an affair , it knew about it rides to planned parenthood \? regular rides to a cancer hospital \? interviews at a rival company \? uber knows about them , too uber is n't alone numerous companies , from social media sites like facebook to dating sites like okcupid , make it their business to track what we do , whom we know and what our typical behaviors and preferences are okcupid unashamedly announced that it experimented on its users , sometimes matching them with incompatible dates , just to see what happened the data collection gets more extensive at every turn they state in clearer terms that facebook will be tracking your location \( unless you disable it \) , vacuuming up data that other people provide about you and even contacts from your phone s address book \( if you sync it to your account \) important provisions many of facebook s 135 billion users may not even notice when they click accept we use these apps and websites because of their benefits we discover new music , restaurants and movies we meet new friends and reconnect with old ones we trade goods and services the paradox of this situation is that while we gain from digital connectivity , the accompanying invasion into our private lives makes our personal data ripe for abuse revealing things we thought we had not even disclosed the retailer target , for example , started sending coupons for baby gear to customers who , sales data told them , were likely to be pregnant that merely knowing a facebook user s likes was enough to predict attributes such as gender , race , sexual orientation , political party , potential drug use and personality traits even if the user had shared none of that information facebook says that it conducts not one but and a former facebook that experiments are run on every user at some point that a single tweak modifying an i voted button on facebook increased turnout in the 2010 congressional elections by about 340 , 000 votes that is enormous power what s rare is not the kind of analysis uber can do with sensitive data , but that it was publicly disclosed because of the user backlash , companies are moving toward secrecy that would be detrimental to the public interest uber argues that it s doing only what other technology companies regularly do that may be true but it only underlines why we need oversight mechanisms that cover all of them reputational penalties have not been sufficient incentives to encourage more responsible use of data and algorithms , especially because almost all the big players engage in similar behavior and uber has just been rewarded by its investors to the tune of 12 billion codes of conduct developed by companies are a start , but we need independent , external bodies that oversee how data is used , backed by laws that ensure that individuals can see , correct and opt out of data collection the european union has established strict controls on personal data that include provisions of privacy , limited and legitimate use and user access to their own data that shows that accountability is possible we already regulate sensitive data , ranging from health records to financial information we must update oversight for 21stcentury data as well when we 're picked up on a rainy street corner , it s not enough to know where the car is going we need to know where our data is going , and how it s used
is not about to be spoiled by sudden success the next latenight host on comedy central said a friend recently told him not to let success change him mr wilmore , who is 53 and probably best known for his stinging comedy commentaries as the senior black correspondent on the daily show , said he responded it s too late for success to do anything to me i'm too old success had its chance it s too late for you , success you had your shot you 're not going to change me at this point that was a bit of a comedy riff , of course but mr wilmore was sincere about appreciating the opportunity when his new latenight show starts on comedy central the start date , being announced officially on thursday , is jan 19 when you 're older and you get this kind of thing , you can really enjoy it for what it is , he said on sunday i'm raring to go he said he was also not thrown by the pressure of limited time to get the show up and running , nor a lastminute wrinkle in its official identity when the series was announced last may by jon stewart , the daily show host and mr wilmore s mentor \( as well as an executive producer on the new show \) , the title was to be the minority report with larry wilmore that sounded both clever and original to everyone involved , and , of course , it had the ring of familiarity from the 2002 but the ring got a bit too loud in august when the studio that owns the film , fox , announced it was making a television pilot based on the movie it became complicated , mr wilmore explained , because the only way to retain the original title would have been to always use it in the complete form it would get a bit unwieldy , he said , when discussing the show in interviews or on social media repeatedly to say the minority report with larry wilmore the last thing you want is brand confusion , he said so on thursday , he and comedy central are unveiling the new title the nightly show with larry wilmore that was the simplest choice , mr wilmore said it also fits nicely , temporally , between the shows that will bracket it four evenings a week the daily show and at midnight the main thrust will be to examine issues from the point of view of the underdog in that way , the title change is probably a good one , he said it was never intended to be a show only about minorities , mr wilmore said it s a show about underdogs , and that happens in a lot of different forms , whether it s race , gender , or whatever not that he did n't muse about other possible titles i thought we could make it the wilmoret report , ' with an invisible t , he said colbert' has had the silent t we could have had an invisible one even without the t , connections to the departing colbert report will be extensive for the new effort he is not only inheriting mr colbert s position on the comedy central schedule , he is also moving into the studio and offices that production is vacating when mr colbert ends his run dec 18 i'm also moving into stephen s house and driving his old car , mr wilmore said he did seriously consider the title meet the rest , because his new show is intended to be , as he put it , a cousin of meet the press' though the show is still very much a work in progress , mr wilmore said the nightly show would regularly feature a panel discussion a scripted comedy version of what is seen on sundaymorning talk he said he would probably start each show with a comedy take on something in the news , delivered in all likelihood from a seat at a desk , the way mr stewart and mr colbert have long opened their shows the cast will consist of those who are called players rather than correspondents , but they may do a comedy report as the daily show does and then be interviewed by mr wilmore before joining the panel he said unscripted interviews with people connected to the news are also being discussed , though he will not rely on a roster of the usual suspects who turn up on sundaymorning shows if we are dealing with a labor issue , he said , we may have somebody who is actually on the line picketing , he said but he also emphasized that the nightly show would be comedy we 're not doing heavy social issues every night , mr wilmore said the writing and performing staffs are still being put together , and the production will have only about a month to build the set after mr colbert exits in the first weeks of january , mr wilmore said , he hopes to do a series of practice shows to get a sense of how everything will work none of this is daunting , mr wilmore said well , except for the part about succeeding mr colbert stephen has been so amazing and he has such a loyal following , that part is a bit daunting but after a long career as a standup comedian , writer , and creator and show runner of sitcoms \( most recently the new abc hit blackish \) , mr wilmore is happy to step into the glare that comes with being the star of his own show when my father was in his 40s , he went back to school to become a doctor , mr wilmore said he was a probation officer before that he started taking premed courses , and he just did it he was a really solid student because he had perspective he was n't out playing beer pong every night it was such a lesson to me i'm having the time of my life with this

fort meade , md defense lawyers on monday sought further delays in the war crimes case against five detainees accused of aiding the sept 11 terrorist attacks , telling a military judge that there had been greater scrutiny of defense teams by the than had previously come to light they said that at least four members of defense teams none of them lawyers had been questioned by the fbi starting in january 2013 as part of two separate investigations , details of which remained murky the lawyers said that until they knew more , neither they nor their clients could know whether they had a conflict of interest and needed to step aside i feel that i'm under scrutiny , said david nevin , the lead lawyer for , the selfdescribed architect of the attacks mr nevin said that he had postponed a factfinding trip to the middle east because of the fbi scrutiny , adding i am trimming my sails i am being extremely careful about how i proceed the case stalled in april after it that the fbi had questioned a member of the defense team for ramzi bin alshibh , asking him to sign a confidentiality agreement the judge , col james l pohl of the army , halted the hearings and appointed a special justice department team led by fernando campoamorsanchez , an assistant united states attorney , to explain what happened mr campoamorsanchez filed a that has not been made public but that apparently says the investigation stemmed from accusations that an information security officer had improperly facilitated communications between mr bin alshibh and people overseas , but the fbi closed the case without charges on may 12 prosecutors have asked colonel pohl to let pretrial hearings in the longdelayed case move forward , and on monday , mr campoamorsanchez said that the additional details sought by defense lawyers including confirmation of who was questioned by the fbi and what they had told the bureau were legally irrelevant to any conflict of interest if there is no investigation , the conflict of interest claim must fail , mr campoamorsanchez said later , turning to look at the defense lawyers , he added with emphasis , no , there is not any informant or mole in the defense camp colonel pohl made no ruling about the request james harrington , a defense lawyer for mr bin alshibh , said that while mr campoamorsanchez had been preparing his report , the defense lawyers asked current and former members of their teams whether anyone else had had contact with the fbi that brought to light that at least two investigators one on mr bin alshibh s team , and one on the team of had spoken with the fbi about the suspicions about the information security officer , he said one was a former undercover agent with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives who apparently became suspicious about something in november 2013 we have had basically a spy within our team for a number of months , mr harrington said it also brought to light , mr nevin later added , that in january 2013 the fbi conducted a separate and shortlived investigation into something undisclosed involving a linguist on mr mohammed s defense team because the five detainees have a joint defense agreement , members of different defense teams share information and resources like linguists both investigators and the security officer have left the teams , but the linguist is apparently still working on mr mohammed s team the lawyers said they still did not know for sure who was talking to the fbi and whether attorneyclient privileged information was shared they asked for discovery , including being allowed to question the fbi officials who supervised the investigations but mr campoamorsanchez said the defense lawyers and the judge already knew everything that was relevant to make a determination into whether , under the law , any of them had a conflict of interest he also argued that it was incoherent for them to try to litigate over the matter if they thought they were under the cloud of a conflict , suggesting that allowing them to do so might create an error that could allow any eventual guilty verdict to be challenged on appeal
as album sales plummet in the age of file sharing and spotify , musicians are finding increasingly idiosyncratic ways of getting their music out there and persuading listeners to pay for it here are two installments from the annals of peculiar record release formats of the early 21st century the inventive songwriter beck , having just had a critical hit with morning phase , is about to release another album that is likely to give rise to future trivia riddles for example , which album did beck release in 2012 , and then , for the first time , in 2014 \? or , which album did beck release twice , but never actually recorded \? the correct answer will be song reader , a collection of 20 tunes that beck released in december 2012 but beck used the word album in much the way a 19thcentury composer would have the production was a collection of sheet music for 20 new songs , plus art work , published by mcsweeney s , and just as most listeners in the early 1800s heard beethoven symphonies for the first time by playing them on the piano , beck expected listeners to pitch in as his webpage for the production put it , it is an album that only you can bring to life none of which was enough to keep rolling stone from listing it as one of the top 50 albums of 2013 now , for those who never learned an instrument or were too busy to work through the album in its printed form , beck is releasing the collection in a form you can hear what you won t hear , for the most part , are beck s interpretations he performs only one of the songs , heaven s ladder the other 19 were recorded by a starry cast of friends jeff tweedy , jack white , loudon wainwright iii , gabriel kahane with the ymusic ensemble , jarvis cocker , david johansen and norah jones , among them rabbit rabbit , the duo formed by the avantgarde violinist and singer carla kihlstedt and the percussionist and keyboardist matthias bossi \( who are also married \) , has come up with a more involved distribution method two years ago they set up a website , rabbit rabbit radio , to which fans could subscribe on a paywhatyoucan basis \( generally between 2 and 5 a month , by paypal \) mr bossi and ms kihlstedt committed to writing and producing a new song every month , which subscribers could download , as well as extras video clips , essays , lists of restaurants they discovered on tour , photos that could be explored on the site at the end of each year , they would collect the year s tracks , tweak them if necessary , and release them as an album , which nonsubscribers could catch up with the first , rabbit rabbit radio , vol 1 , was released on cd last year but for rabbit rabbit radio , vol 2 swallow me whole , the group is taking a new approach we re ditching the cd format altogether , ms kihlstedt said in an email never had much love for it anyway instead the album will be released as a download on group s webpage \( and , eventually , itunes \) , but fans who want something physical can get a deluxe edition in the form of a limited edition \( 240 copies \) silkscreened print by the artist dan mccarthy , for 40 the prints are signed by mr mccarthy , ms kihlstedt and ms bossi , and include a handwritten download code for the album the idea , ms kihlstedt said , is that those who still love things with tactile beauty will be interested in the poster those who aren t can simply by the digital album
los angeles for most of the clippers' 30year tenure in los angeles , they have been viewed as a punch line in hightops and so , a day after the nba commissioner gave the team s owner , donald sterling , a lifetime ban and recommended that owners vote him out , the conversation about who might replace mr sterling revealed the clippers to be in a strikingly unfamiliar position the toast of the town the prospect of an auction created a frenzy , with hands flying up , playfully and not , for a chance to bid on the most coveted commodity in professional sports , a competitive team in a major market that means the clippers , the forgotten franchise of los angeles sports , are suddenly the belle of basketball oprah winfrey is interested in forming a powerhouse partnership to buy the team with the silicon valley mogul larry ellison and the entertainment mogul david geffen , winfrey s spokeswoman said the billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist eli broad is also interested , according to his spokeswoman so is the boxer floyd mayweather jr along with his rival oscar de la hoya dr dre , an icon of west coast rap , has expressed interest in the team , as has sean combs , who may be an icon of east coast rap but has caught clippers fever just the same i will always be a knicks fan , he said on twitter , but i am a business man  the comedian mindy kaling said she , too , was interested in buying the clippers , promising that the uniforms will be the same but bedazzled of course , many , if not most , of the offers are unlikely to materialize \( no one is waiting for judd apatow and don rickles to submit an official bid anytime soon , despite mr apatow s tweet that they were considering it \) it would not be the first time celebrities sought to capitalize on a big story \( mr mayweather just happens to be fighting in las vegas on saturday \) all the attention and adoration may be disorienting for the clippers , a franchise that for a long time was perhaps the worst in pro sports , a basketball calamity that had two winning seasons in mr sterling s first 30 years the clippers had none of the glamour of the lakers , who have boasted a flotilla of hall of fame superstars playing before crowds studded with namebrand celebrities but the clippers' redandblue logo , which once represented futility , has suddenly become a symbol of something very different the team s overnight transformation is a classic hollywood tale an ugly story becomes a heartwarming one , complete with a \( potential \) happy ending and , even better , lots of celebrity cameos there is also the twist that the national basketball association s permanent exile of mr sterling , now the most reviled man in pro sports , could well end with him profiting enormously a real estate baron widely derided as a slumlord , mr sterling bought the team in 1981 , when it was based in san diego , for 127 million forbes estimated this year that the team was worth about 575 million and that was before the clippers were dominating headlines the mechanics of how a clippers sale might work or even if it will happen remain unclear the league s other 29 owners would have to vote by a threequarters majority that they wanted mr sterling out of the league , and the timing of that has not been announced nevertheless , rick caruso , a los angeles real estate magnate , said that the team was whitehot and that he expected the bidding to go above the forbes estimate \( he also said that he was assembling a team to examine a bid \) this is all new terrain for the clippers the clippers and the lakers play in the same arena , staples center , but until recently , their games might as well have been played on another planet clippers tickets were sold at a fraction of the price the team s celebrity fans were blisters the visiting team won more often than not the most recognizable fans of the city s two basketball teams neatly represent the ethos of their fan bases as a lakers fan , jack nicholson has a confident nonchalance that says , wake me up when the playoffs start , while billy crystal , a clippers fan , speaks for the tortured , selfdeprecating schlubs who spill their sodas at timeouts one is all swag , the other a running gag but even before the sterling scandal upended the basketball world , the teams had essentially traded personalities the lakers , troubled by injuries and miscalculations , endured the worst season in their history the city has spent months grumbling about the lakers' ownership dynamic jim and jeanie buss took over after their father , jerry , died last year the team is trying to rebuild around the aging kobe bryant , who was limited to six games this season because of injuries by contrast , the clippers are ascendant , having posted their third consecutive winning season with a franchiserecord 57 victories they have two of the best and most marketable players in the nba , chris paul and blake griffin , who play a flashy brand of basketball , heavy on alleyoops and other dunks , that prompted the moniker lob city and with doc rivers s arrival , they added a rare coach with championship gravitas the team has sold out every home game in the last three seasons clearly , it s a strange dynamic , said steve perrin , the managing editor of a clippers fan site , clipsnationcom there were many years when it was a proud , quirky thing i wore a clippers hat , and people thought , you 're a clippers fan \? ' there was some bemusement there was n't a reason to root for the clippers now , there is an opportunity to replace one of pro sports' most notorious owners with something that fans say surely must be better baron davis , a former clipper who was once heckled by mr sterling for not playing up to a sixyear , 65 million contract , said it was important to have an owner who was a minority michael jordan , the owner of the charlotte bobcats , and vivek ranadive , the leader of the ownership group of the sacramento kings , are the only minority owners in the league diversity is important , mr davis said especially with what happened here most agree that the clippers have room for enormous growth on the business side the team s television deal , which expires in 2016 , is nowhere near the 20year , 3 billion deal the lakers signed with time warner cable two years ago until recently , mr sterling rarely invested aggressively in his team on or off the court with a sale , the clippers could receive the sort of bump that the dodgers did when a loathed owner , frank mccourt , was forced to sell the dodgers were acquired by a financial services magnate whose ownership group included magic johnson it will be like a breath of fresh air you just open the door , and this fresh breeze comes through , said mychal thompson , the lakers' radio analyst , who once played for them but whoever the new owners are , they 're going to have to be really creative with this franchise to be able to compete for the hearts and minds of lakers fans of course , there would be one surefire way to appeal to lakers fans and to write a storybook ending to the sterling scandal enter mr johnson , the lakers hall of famer who is revered for his charisma and business acumen , particularly for his efforts in africanamerican neighborhoods mr johnson was dragged into the scandal when mr sterling asked a woman he was often seen with not to post online pictures of herself with black men , including one in which she posed with mr johnson do n't put him on instagram for the world to see so they have to call me , mr sterling said in a recording released by tmz and do n't bring him to my games yeah , it bothers me a lot that you want to promo , broadcast , that you 're associating with black people do you have to \? mr johnson has denied a report that said he was interested in joining a group to buy the clippers , but that has not stopped los angeles from talking about it if you want the hollywood ending to all this , said mr perrin , the clippers blogger , it s magic johnson
i do n't have more than this one life , the tenor said in a recent conversation at the metropolitan opera i do n't have more to offer and i 've still got a family that i , from time to time , need to see and that s a problem the intricacy of balancing his operatic and personal lives sensibly expanding his repertory in the midst of an overstuffed schedule is undoubtedly a problem for mr kaufmann but it may be just as much of one for the opera house administrators who have come to depend on him as a boxoffice draw , and for the international audiences that in remarkably short order less than a decade , really have embraced him as the most important , versatile tenor of his generation his curly hair grayer than it was just a couple of years ago , mr kaufmann , 44 , has returned to the met to perform the title role in massenet s , which he sang at the paris opera in 2010 and the vienna state opera in 2011 directed by richard eyre , conducted by alain altinoglu and featuring his paris and vienna costar , the mezzosoprano sophie koch , it opens on feb 18 , the latest in what has become an annual tradition of kaufmannanchored new productions at the company the previous three highlighted the range of this gifted artist as well as the difficulty of picking parts that will suit a singer at a given moment particularly since opera companies cast many major roles up to five years in advance so the baritonal depths of siegmund in wagner s came across as too heavy for mr kaufmann in 2011 while the notes were certainly possible for him , his voice s center of gravity lay higher but later that year , the title role in gounod s seemed too light for a sound that has grown more darkly hooded in the past decade it s very difficult to decide what you 're willing to commit to in five or six years' time , he said because it s very difficult to really know what your voice is in five years' time or what you want to do then , because that s one of the main things you need to keep in this business keep the attraction , keep the joy he came closest to a happy medium in the title role of fran ois girard s elegant production of wagner s last year but no german roles were included on a brief list of some of mr kaufmann s coming parts at the met , provided by a company spokesman don jos in bizet s carmen and cavaradossi in puccini s , both of which he has sung there before , and des grieux in puccini s , which he is adding to his repertory in june at the royal opera house in london building on his recent met seasons , the list of roles continues to provide a mixture of languages and styles it has long been a priority of mr kaufmann and his management that he not be pigeonholed he continues to be active in lieder as well as in opera two days after werther opens , he makes his carnegie hall recital debut with of schumann , liszt and wagner his , coming on the heels of verdi and wagner discs , is a recording of schubert s winterreise but that small selection of future roles provided by the met inevitably contains omissions \( where s the verdi \? \) some have speculated that the extreme stylization of the met s robert wilson production of wagner s lohengrin a gorgeously colored show but hard on its performers made him reluctant to sing the opera s conflicted hero in new york , but mr kaufmann denied that in our conversation whatever the reason , it s unfortunate that we cannot plan to hear it at the met , because that role is mr kaufmann s desertisland musthave the part benefits from the burnished darkness that is now basic to his sound he has to work audibly to gain a clarion quality at the top of his voice , which comes across as rivetingly muscled rather than irritatingly strained a certain quality of remoteness in his onstage presence , which has sometimes felt like detachment , is also ideal for the otherworldly lohengrin \( the same quality makes tantalizing mr kaufmann s suggestion in the interview that he wants to sing the enigmatic pell as in debussy s pell as et m lisande someday \) you do n't have to take my word for it on youtube , there is extraordinary footage of mr kaufmann singing lohengrin s final monologue , in fernem land , during his of the role in munich in the summer of 2009 nothing stings for me personally more than the lack of his lohengrin here but also missing from the met s list are the new parts in which mr kaufmann has recently triumphed in europe manrico in verdi s il trovatore , don alvaro in the same composer s la forza del destino and dick johnson in puccini s la fanciulla del west , the last of which he has expressed particular interest in doing in new york i 've talked to peter gelb just today about it , he said , referring to the met s general manager i said this is made for the met when does it come back here \? ' because it s such a beauty if it s well done one source of the problem and once again , it s as much a problem for opera house administrators and audiences as for mr kaufmann is that he has long made a practice of avoiding a commitment to a second production of a role before he has sung it for the first time \( lohengrin was a notable exception \) of manrico , alvaro and dick , for instance , he said that none is yet scheduled for another house in the contemporary opera industry , that means he may well be waiting for several years before being able to sing them again , even though he found all three congenial there s always a little bit of a risk that you realize that this is maybe a shoe that is still too big for you , he said but his success in the heroic , difficult forza part has convinced him that he is ready for one of the touchstones of the tenor repertory the vocally and dramatically strenuous title role in verdi s masterpiece , otello , which is now officially on the horizon , although where is unclear now that i 've sung forza , ' he said , everybody says so why are you waiting for this otello \? you 're ready , you 're right' well , all right , i did n't know until i did the forza' the first time now i know , and now the others know , and now i'm waiting for the first otello to come , and i have scheduled it already , and it comes in two or two and a half years but that decision only brings with it more of the same shall i now go the risk and take another production of otello' \? do i really want to wait \? if i do it in two and a half years , the next otello' could then be in only seven and a half years \? maybe i'm now ready to take the risk and say , ok , i know i can do it' this selfquestioning is a constant with mr kaufmann , who is candid and selfaware speaking to him , even for just an hour , i felt closer to the conflicting currents of being an opera star in the 21st century than i have had in interviewing almost any other artist the opposite tugs on his loyalties , from risk and caution , work and family \( his wife , the mezzosoprano margarete joswig , and their three children live in munich \) , are palpable is it worth giving up so much free time for this or is it not \? even when he s not asking a question , his language is perpetually couched in the conditional i could do this , but then his relentless introspection has made mr kaufmann exceptionally cautious not just about what he takes on , but also about when he chooses not to sing one of the frustrations of being a fan of mr kaufmann s is the reputation he has earned , not without reason , as a chronic canceler , a situation i 've experienced at home in new york and when i traveled to see him in vienna two days after our conversation at the met , mr kaufmann begged off a concert in montreal scheduled the following day , citing a nasty flu that prevents me from singing he said in the interview i always see it in long terms and i know that if you do too many mistakes meaning singing when you should n't then you have to pay that bill at the end of your career he added , i really think you can harm your instrument a tiny bit , but these tiny bits , after 20 years , you 're going to know the frequency of mr kaufmann s cancellations may have its roots in the anxieties that gripped him early in his career when he graduated from a conservatory in munich in 1994 , he joined the opera company in saarbr cken , germany there , artificially lightening his tone , he had what he has described as a vocal crisis i felt onstage i was always frightened , he said in the interview i was always panicking that the voice would just stop , because i was n't in control of that instrument even though the roles were not impossible ones , he said , this was one reason why i always got sick when mr kaufmann discusses his career arc , he describes how his voice settled and darkened as he relaxed but his caution excessive , some might call it stuck with him , the edge that comes from knowing that your gifts were not always yours and will someday pass from you coupled with his distinctive smoky sound , that melancholy provides the extra measure of depth that makes him not a good artist , but an indispensable one
kabul , afghanistan three soldiers with the americanled coalition were killed and five were wounded on tuesday after a suicide car bomber struck their convoy at the gates of an american military base in kabul , according to afghan and american officials the attack took place just outside an american special operations base there was no confirmation from the international security assistance force about the nationalities of the victims on the same day , the afghan interior minister confirmed in testimony before parliament that the past six months had been the deadliest of the 13yearlong conflict with the taliban , with 1 , 368 afghan police officers killed and 2 , 370 wounded since march 21 , the beginning of the current afghan year police casualties have generally run at twice the level of afghan army casualties through much of the war the minister , mohammad omar daudzai , also said the taliban had carried out 700 attacks against the police during that period , and he blamed foreign fighters a formulation commonly understood to mean pakistani militants working with taliban forces for many of the assaults a spokesman for the interior ministry , sediq sediqqi , said that 13 civilians had been wounded in tuesday s attack , but that none had been killed he also said 17 vehicles had been damaged a spokesman for the taliban , zabiullah mujahid , claimed responsibility for the bombing in a he later said in a statement that the civilian casualties had been caused by glass shattering in car windows and were unintentional the attack took place near a crowded intersection , massoud circle , opposite the american embassy and in front of the military base , around 8 am , in the middle of rush hour mr sediqqi said a maroon toyota corolla packed with explosives exploded near a twovehicle isaf convoy
bagram , afghanistan on thursday at 9 10 am , the gates of the bagram prison swung open , and 65 men with long beards and new clothes walked out to freedom the moment showed clearly just how thoroughly president hamid karzai had broken with the american military , here now 12 years american officials had lobbied intensely with the afghan government , first in private and then in increasingly acrimonious terms in public , to prevent the release of men they believed were not only dangerous insurgents with american and afghan blood on their hands , but also men who would be convicted of that in an afghan court of law instead , american soldiers on duty at bagram could do nothing more than watch on closedcircuit television monitors as afghan military police used ford pickup trucks to ferry the prisoners to the nearest bazaar to catch taxis , saving them a mileandahalf walk prison authorities had given each man , in addition to clothes , warm coats and 5 , 000 afghanis , or about 90 nearly half the base monthly salary of an afghan police officer mr karzai , on a visit to turkey with his defense minister , bismullah khan , was unmoved by american cries of foul if afghan judiciary authorities decide to release prisoners , it s of no concern to the us , he said , according to a twitter message from his spokesman , many american military leaders could not help noticing a troubling parallel with iraq , where hundreds of sunni inmates have , often in mass jail breaks , giving new impetus to the insurgency there as one nato officer in kabul noted wryly here , they do n't even have to escape they just walk out , thanks to our own allies mr karzai to sign a longterm security agreement , which would keep american troops here past this year the americans want the agreement signed by december , well before the april 5 presidential election in afghanistan the american military signed an agreement that only afghan forces could raid homes at night , even though the military long regarded the raids as essential to its strategy to demands from mr karzai , the american military also pulled special operations units out of parts of wardak province , and since then has all but stopped bombing raids to avoid risking more civilian casualties and although mr karzai has complained about coalitioncaused civilian deaths , he has been relatively silent about far more numerous civilian casualties inflicted by insurgents last month , he said nothing in public when his aides photographic evidence of civilians killed in an airstrike against this backdrop , said a coalition official speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivities , this does feel like that moment when everything changes the official added , we 've survived many disputes with the afghans we take a few body blows , but we muddle through and the mission keeps going of all the disputes with afghan leaders , none has been as infuriating as the prisoner releases , especially to military commanders steeped in a tradition of force protection above all else detainees from this group of 65 are directly linked to attacks killing or wounding 32 us or coalition personnel and 23 afghan security personnel or civilians , the american military said thursday in a statement if the past is any guide , the statement noted , some of these prisoners will head right back to war , like many of the 560 other suspected insurgents who the afghans have released from bagram in the past year in an email , the american military said it believed that some of these newly freed insurgents had already returned to the fight that and previous statements and by the american military were unusually outspoken , demanding that the final group of prisoners handed over to afghan custody whose cases were under review be sent to stand trial one of those who walked out thursday morning was abdul samad , who said he had been picked up in the insurgentdominated district of andar in ghazni province 15 months ago , and was on his way to nerkh district , another insurgent stronghold in wardak province , to meet his brother riding in a taxi with four other released prisoners , mr samad said in a cellphone interview that he was a farmer , not an insurgent , and had never been given a reason for his arrest they did not find any evidence against me to prove my involvement in any wrongdoing , he said the other released prisoners , three from kandahar and one from ghazni , got out of the taxi in kabul , while mr samad continued on to wardak in its statement , the american military expressed strong concern about the potential threats these detainees pose to coalition forces and afghan security forces and civilians mr karzai , at a news conference in ankara on thursday , responded that the american military should stop harassing the afghan judiciary , according to mr faizi the 65 men were ordered released by an afghan review board , which determined that there was not enough evidence to try them , according to abdul shakor dadras , who heads the board mr dadras said he expected that most of the remaining 23 detainees would be released as well in washington , the response of obama administration officials was more muted than that of the military in afghanistan is it really worth a showdown if the afghans do n't want to prosecute \? one official said and what about the quality of the evidence \? anyone could be prosecuted it does n't mean they have to be many of the prisoners had been held in bagram for years as enemy combatants , without judicial review by afghan authorities mr karzai , who has called the prison a talibanproducing factory , has said repeatedly that he wants to although there are hundreds of others being held there by afghan authorities the only prisoners known to still be in american custody at the facility are an unknown number of foreign prisoners , believed to be mostly pakistanis administration officials said they did not want to stake the entire relationship between the two countries on this single issue , and emphasized that they would prefer to wait out mr karzai s term in office , which ends later this year , than confront him over the release of 65 prisoners such patience was less evident in congress one of the most ardent supporters of the american partnership with afghanistan , senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina , warned that unless mr karzai backed off the escalating vitriol directed at the united states in recent months , the afghan leader could destroy what little support was left in washington for keeping american troops in afghanistan and , more important , for spending billions of dollars a year there to help finance the country s government mr graham said that he now intended to make good on recent threats to have congress withhold development assistance to afghanistan until after mr karzai leaves office he was confident that congress would approve it , saying he was one of the few highprofile politicians still committed to the american project in afghanistan but not at any cost , he added the amount of people advocating for a longterm relationship with afghanistan is pretty small in congress , mr graham said in an interview on thursday no politician in america is going to get much blowback for just pulling out of afghanistan
returning to new york after nine years , the bolshoi ballet the most heroically warmblooded of ballet companies seems keen to prove that it has reverted to the ghastly artistic torpor it enjoyed in the last two decades of the soviet era for a short time this century \( thanks principally to the choreographer alexei ratmansky , who was for a few years its artistic director \) , this flagship company became an important center of new choreography and home to major revivals that changed russia s and the world s view of dance history but the three productions that it s showing as part of the lincoln center festival , all deriving from an earlier era , have been seen here before a lot and none of them are good the bolshoi orchestra , conducted this week by pavel sorokin , is superb most of the dancers are excellent , with virtues lacking in most western dancers and yet on tuesday s opening night at the david h koch theater , those merits could n't save the company from making swan lake a bore at the start of every dance , my heart would lift again , noting some marvelous feature of bolshoi style the communicative generosity of manner ! the thickcream legato flow and keen dynamic sense ! the juicy redmeat richness of texture ! the unaffectedly erect posture of the torsos and their gorgeous pliancy ! the easy amplitude of line ! the powerful sweep through space ! yet nothing availed each dance soon grew monotonous \( a 1999 staging based on a much older bolshoi tradition \) and \( a 1968 blockbuster first seen here in 1975 \) , which open next week , have always been kitsch but we can at least hope they 'll be delivered with the kind of bolshoi panache that makes them enjoyable , even irresistible it s dismaying , though , to rediscover how the choreographer , 88 \( the company s artistic director from 1964 to 1995 , and currently listed as the bolshoi s sole ballet master \) , turns the tragedy of into kitsch , too painstakingly , he sucks all the drama from it mr grigorovich s 1969 production revised in 2001 , often seen here between 1975 and 2005 and more recently in live broadcast gives us not swan lake but cult of swan lake everything is ritualized , abstracted , stylized , with almost no momentbymoment narrative tension the music for swan lake tells us clearly when the princess mother enters in the first scene , and when the heroine odette and the corps of swan maidens enter in the next one but mr grigorovich brings on the princess mother a few bars late , whereas odette and her swan maidens have already been onstage before the music that signifies their first appearance the role of the sorcerer von rothbart , originally a nondance role controlling odette s fate , is melodramatically beefed up into a dancing evil genius whose chief function is to be prince siegfried s nemesis a dark black alter ego who repeatedly shadows the shiningwhite hero , doing the same tedious steps behind his back you can still admire on film the exuberant fervor with which the old bolshoi used to perform the national dances of the ballroom scene but the grigorovich version leeches the life out of them , placing the women on point and turning them all into politely classicized exercises the new ending for siegfried \( was i having a bad dream about swans \? \) , with a nasty rearrangement of tchaikovsky s score , is dismal the two liveliest performances on tuesday were in the two ghastliest roles as the evil genius and as the fool these men are among the most remarkable and intelligent performers in today s bolshoi emerged as a danceactor of a new kind of subtly detailed naturalism in this year s broadcast of mr ratmansky s threeact here all he s allowed to do is a kind of hammy brute force , but his timing , energy and focus are such that you long to see him in real choreography i saw mr tsvirko this march in moscow play two different characters in the bolshoi s production of marco spada , including though he was the youngest of the three marco spadas i saw , he alone convincingly had the weight and complexity of a hero whose daughter is of marriageable age the fool \( or jester \) is a tiresome clich added to most russian productions of swan lake in the 20th century , all trite perkiness i have consistently loathed every interpreter , until mr tsvirko , who gave it wit , freshness , even mystery tuesday s star couple were and , both dancers who began their careers elsewhere ms zakharova with the kirov \( now mariinsky \) ballet of st petersburg , mr hallberg with american ballet theater physically alike tall , with long , tapering limbs and strikingly arched feet they both seem like guest stars within the moscow company , the least hotblooded people onstage and the most preciously exquisite still , mr hallberg has learned much from the bolshoi he danced in stunningly long sequences , calmly showing how the end of one phrase was the start of the next , happily eating up space though his upper body has always had distinction , it has now acquired yet more expansiveness he behaved to his codancers with charm and courtesy but mr grigorovich turns siegfried into a passive ninny , and mr hallberg s rare grace lacks the virile force that can give this some gravitas it s sad to see the deadening effect of this production , with its many repetitions of steps , on good dancers i never expected to tire of mr hallberg s marvelous piqu arabesque or grand jet they exemplify the luster of classical ballet , shining like beacons but on tuesday , i kept thinking , enough already and the same was true of many of this company s most admirable artists i do not count ms zakharova among those , however though she is beautiful , nothing about her radiates you watch but do not feel her dancing when she raises her arms or bends forward , you observe with detachment when the corps of swan maidens does the same , something in your own body answers hers is toneless dancing \( even or especially when she throws in her specialty ultrahigh kicks and extensions \) both her romantic pathos as odette and her flashy virtuosity as odile consist solely of hollow , unoriginal effects irksome , too , is the vanity she shows in bows , conducting the audience in applause as if to say , do you have any notion how splendid i am \?
taxpayers complaining about a donothing congress should take note that free travel junkets by lawmakers and their staffs are on the rise house members doing something last year , they took more free trips financed by special interests than were taken in any other year since jack abramoff , the legendary republican uberlobbyist , was sentenced to prison in 2006 for corrupt schemes that gave congressional junketeering a bad name the privately paid vacations are legal and eminently defensible in the view of lawmakers who accept these trips in the name of fact finding in an interesting twist that went unnoticed until the national journal it this week , the house ethics committee had quietly ended the watergateera reform requiring that privately financed travels be made public in the personal financial statements lawmakers must file each year after this was reported , the committee s leaders to reverse the decision defenders of the change had earlier cited the need to reduce duplicative paperwork as the only motive , not evasion of disclosure of expensive flights and stays at fourstar hotels they argued that the disclosure could be found elsewhere , in a separate office of the house clerk disclosed readily or not , junketeering has been on the increase there were almost 1 , 900 trips taken in 2013 by congress , staff aides and spouses last year at a cost of more than 6 million , paid from the pockets of private groups with legislative agendas , according to legistorm , the online database that tracks congressional lobbying some of the trip underwriters are in nonprofit organizations created as a way around postabramoff restrictions on lobbyists' free spending on congress so far , none of the privileged travelers are proposing the sensible alternative to free junketeering appealing to taxpayers to finance their fact finding efforts of course , that would mean actually working and would end the sense of mutual debt and fun lawmakers and specialinterest lobbyists have in their joint travels

washington chinese hackers in march broke into the computer networks of the united states government agency that houses the personal information of all federal employees , according to senior american officials they appeared to be targeting the files on tens of thousands of employees who have applied for topsecret security clearances the hackers gained access to some of the databases of the office of personnel management before the federal authorities detected the threat and blocked them from the network , according to the officials it is not yet clear how far the hackers penetrated the agency s systems , in which applicants for security clearances list their foreign contacts , previous jobs and personal information like past drug use in response to questions about the matter , a senior official confirmed that the attack had occurred but said that at this time , neither the personnel agency nor homeland security had identified any loss of personally identifiable information the official said an emergency response team was assigned to assess and mitigate any risks identified one senior american official said that the attack was traced to , though it was not clear if the hackers were part of the government its disclosure comes as a delegation of senior american officials , led by secretary of state john kerry , are in beijing for the annual strategic and economic dialogue , the leading forum for discussion between the united states and china on their commercial relationships and their wary efforts to work together on economic and defense issues computer intrusions have been a major source of discussion and disagreement between the two countries , and the chinese can point to evidence , revealed by edward j snowden , that the national security agency went deep into the computer systems of huawei , a major maker of computer network equipment , and ran many programs to intercept the conversations of chinese leaders and the military american officials say the attack on the office of personnel management was notable because while hackers try to breach united states government servers nearly every day , they rarely succeed one of the last attacks the government acknowledged occurred last year at the department of energy in that case , hackers successfully made off with employee and contractors' personal data the agency was forced to reveal the attack because state disclosure laws force entities to report breaches in cases where personally identifiable information is compromised government agencies do not have to disclose breaches in which sensitive government secrets , but no personally identifiable information , has been stolen just a month ago , the justice department indicted a group of chinese hackers who work for the people s liberation army unit 61398 , and charged them with stealing corporate secrets the same unit , and others linked to the pla , have been accused in the past of intrusions into united states government computer systems , including in the office of the secretary of defense but private security researchers say the indictments have hardly deterred the people s liberation army from hacking foreign targets , and american officials are increasingly concerned that they have failed in their effort to deter computer attacks from china or elsewhere there s no price to pay for the chinese , one senior intelligence official said recently , and nothing will change until that changes the indictments have been criticized as long on symbolism and short on real punishment there is very little chance that the chinese military members would ever see the inside of an american courtroom , even if the fbi has put their pictures on wanted posters i think that it was speaking loudly and carrying a small stick , said dennis blair , the former director of national intelligence during president obama s first term , who was a coauthor of a report last year urging that the united states create a series of financial disincentives for computer theft and attacks , including halting some forms of imports and blocking access to american financial markets not long after several members of unit 61398 were indicted , security researchers were able to pin hundreds more cyberattacks at american and european space and satellite technology companies and research groups on a second shanghaibased chinese military unit , known as unit 61486 researchers say that even after americans indicted their counterparts in unit 61398 , members of unit 61486 have shown no signs of scaling back the same proved true for the dozen other chinese military and naval units that american officials have been tracking as they break into an ever more concerning list of corporate targets including drone , missile and nuclear propulsion technology makers the intrusion at the office of personnel management was particularly disturbing because it oversees a system called , in which federal employees applying for security clearances enter their most personal information , including financial data federal employees who have had security clearances for some time are often required to update their personal information through the website the agencies and the contractors use the information from eqip to investigate the employees and ultimately determine whether they should be granted security clearances , or have them updated a representative of the office of personnel management said that monitoring systems at the department of homeland security and the agency office allowed them to be alerted to a potential intrusion of our network in midmarch in the past , the obama administration has urged american companies to share intrusion information with the government and reveal breaches to consumers in cases where their personal information was compromised and could be used without authorization but in this case there was no announcement about the attack the administration has never advocated that all intrusions be made public , said caitlin hayden , a spokeswoman for the obama administration we have advocated that businesses that have suffered an intrusion notify customers if the intruder had access to consumers' personal information we have also advocated that companies and agencies voluntarily share information about intrusions ms hayden noted that the agency had intrusiondetection systems in place and notified other federal agencies , state and local governments about the attack , then shared relevant threat information with some in the security industry four

response to similar threats , ms hayden said
three days after the publication of , the second amendment a biography , elliot rodger , 22 , , stabbing three people and then shooting another eight , killing four of them , including himself this was only in recent memory , going back to columbine in his rigorous , scholarly , but accessible book , waldman notes such horrific events but does n't dwell on them he is after something else he wants to understand how it came to be that the second amendment , long assumed to mean one thing , has come to mean something else entirely to put it another way why are we , as a society , willing to put up with mass shootings as the price we must pay for the right to carry a gun \? the second amendment begins , a wellregulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , and that s where waldman , the president of the brennan center for justice at the new york university school of law , begins , too he has gone back into the framers' original arguments and made two essential discoveries , one surprising and the other not surprising at all the surprising discovery is that of all the amendments that comprise the bill of rights , the second was probably the least debated what we know is that the founders were deeply opposed to a standing army , which they viewed as the first step toward tyranny instead , their assumption was that the male citizenry would all belong to local militias as waldman writes , they were not to have a musket they were to more than a right , being armed was a duty thus the unsurprising discovery virtually every reference to the right of the people to keep and bear arms the second part of the second amendment was in reference to military defense waldman notes the house debate over the second amendment in the summer of 1789 twelve congressmen joined the debate none mentioned a private right to bear arms for selfdefense , hunting or for any purpose other than joining the militia in time , of course , the militia idea died out , replaced by a professionalized armed service most gun regulation took place at the state and city level the judiciary mostly stayed out of the way in 1939 , the supreme court upheld the nation s first national gun law , the national firearms act , which put onerous limits on sawedoff shotguns and machine guns precisely because the guns had no reasonable relation to a wellregulated militia but then , in 1977 , , which was taken over by second amendment fundamentalists over the course of the next 30 years , they set out to do nothing less than change the meaning of the second amendment , so that its final phrase shall not be infringed referred to an individual right to keep and bear arms , rather than a collective right for the common defense waldman is scornful of much of this effort time and again , he finds the proponents of this new view taking the founders' words completely out of context , sometimes laughably so they embrace thomas jefferson because he once wrote to george washington , one loves to possess arms in fact , says waldman , jefferson was referring to some old letter he needed so he could issue a rebuttal in case he got attacked for a decision he made as secretary of state still , as waldman notes , the effort was wildly successful in 1972 , by 1980 , that year , the nra gave its firstever presidential endorsement to ronald reagan the critical modern event , however , was , which tossed aside two centuries of settled law , and ruled that a guncontrol law in washington , dc , was unconstitutional under the second amendment the author of the majority opinion was antonin scalia , who fancies himself the leading originalist on the court meaning he believes , as waldman puts it , that the only legitimate way to interpret the constitution is to ask what the framers and their generation intended in 1789 waldman is persuasive that a truly originalist decision would have tied the right to keep and bear arms to a wellregulated militia but the right to own guns had by then become conservative dogma , and it was inevitable that the five conservative members of the supreme court would vote that way when the militias evaporated , concludes waldman , so did the original meaning of the second amendment but , he adds , what we did not have was a regime of judicially enforced individual rights , able to trump the public good sadly , that is what we have now , as we saw over the weekend elliot rodger s individual right to bear arms trumped the public good eight people were shot as a result
washington an fbi investigation into a member of a defense team for a guant namo bay , cuba , detainee accused of aiding the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks has been closed , a justice department official told a warcrimes court on wednesday the court filing is not yet public but was described by several people familiar with its contents pretrial hearings in the prosecution of five detainees charged in the 2001 attacks last month when defense lawyers complained that fbi agents had interviewed a member of the defense team for ramzi bin alshibh , one of the detainees , and asked him to sign a confidentiality agreement the judge overseeing the military commission tribunal , col james l pohl , appointed a special government review team , separate from the prosecution , to find out what was happening and report back the review team filed a report that has not yet been made public on the tribunal docket because it is being reviewed for public disclosure , although it is not classified according to brian fallon , a justice department spokesman , the filing says the fbi received information in november that a nonattorney member of bin alshibh s defense team may have been involved in facilitating unauthorized communications with bin alshibh and unknown individuals located abroad he continued , the alleged facilitation of these communications may have constituted a federal crime and compromised national security the fbi opened a preliminary investigation , but it was closed without charges the filing asserts that because no defense counsel is under investigation by the bureau , none has a conflict of interest and no inquiry by the military commission is warranted , mr fallon said the filing says that the fbi closed the case on may 12 , according to a defense lawyer , and that the justice department sent the results to the pentagon on wednesday with a request that its details not be shared widely little else is explained the lawyer said the fbi had interviewed three members of the defense team for the investigation
on sunday , after months of bitter wrangling , the two leading candidates in afghanistan s presidential election agreed to form a national unity government ashraf ghani , a pashtun technocrat , is to be president , and abdullah abdullah , a former foreign minister of mixed tajik and pashtun descent , is to be chief executive , a newly created post akin to prime minister the powersharing agreement came after an audit of the ballots cast in a june runoff , in an election widely believed to have been partially rigged it has no basis in afghanistan s election law and given the rancor that has come before , it may not hold very long this deal , which was brokered with help from washington , is yet another makeshift compromise that only reveals the shortcomings of the united states' 13year presence in afghanistan but rather than admit these failures , american and nato officials would have us think that democracy is gaining traction in afghanistan , the taliban insurgency has stalled and al qaeda is being defeated all these arguments , of course , serve as an excuse for us troops to start withdrawing at the end of the year , a plan that seemed wrong when it was made in december 2009 and is proving catastrophically wrong now john sopko , the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction , apparently is the only official in washington who dares speak truth to power in a sept 12 speech at georgetown university , he said that afghanistan remains under assault by insurgents and is short of domestic revenue , plagued by corruption , afflicted by criminal elements involved in opium and smuggling , and struggling to execute basic functions of government his comments were largely ignored by the american media , and there was no immediate reaction from the obama administration and yet anything less than a heavy dose of honesty and fresh thinking by afghans and their western supporters will almost certainly mean the relapse of afghanistan into civil war and the emergence of groups even more extreme than the taliban , as has happened in iraq and syria moving from the lengthy us military presence to full afghan sovereignty was premised on the completion of four distinct transitions but none has been successfully carried out , despite more than 640 billion in us direct spending in afghanistan between 2002 and 2013 the most critical transition , the one on which everything else rested , was political rather than build state institutions or carry out muchneeded electoral reforms , president hamid karzai spent his long tenure encouraging a form of crony politics that failed to sap the power of the warlords he won a second term in 2009 , after a vastly fraudulent election the following year , according to un officials , he asked that the united nations stop supervising elections in the country , and washington and nato went along the second promised transition was military us forces were to hand over security matters to afghan forces , proving that the new , ustrained afghan army would then be able to hold back the taliban on its own yet interior minister mohammad omar daudzai told parliament in kabul on sept 16 that the previous six months had been the deadliest ever for the afghan police today there is fighting in 18 of 34 provinces , afghan and nato officials have told me in many areas , afghan soldiers are barely able to secure their own bases , much less retake lost territory helmand , the critical drugsproducing province in southern afghanistan , is at risk of being taken over by the taliban if it falls , all of southern afghanistan might too the third failed transition has to do with economics according to a senior afghan official at the finance ministry , the washington post reported recently , the afghan government is broke and needs an emergency 537 million bailout it was barely able to pay more than half a million government employees this month money spent on schools and hospitals has dramatically improved education and health for afghans , but these services remain dependent on foreign funding there has been little largescale investment in agriculture or basic industry instead , the bulk of the economy has focused on servicing foreign troops and on their spending and now the troops are about to withdraw when i first visited afghanistan in the 1970s , the country was desperately poor , but it was almost selfsufficient in food and had a small yet thriving export trade in fruit , handicrafts , furs and gems today , afghanistan imports much of its food and it produces very few commercial goods the service economy , which is run by the middle class , has been collapsing , as both educated people and billions of dollars in capital have left the country the resulting vacuum opens the way for the opiumfed underground economy to expand enormously , breeding crime and corruption the fourth contribution expected of the us presence was insulating afghanistan from foreign interference , which many afghans fear as much as the taliban iran , pakistan and russia , but also india , saudi arabia and other states helped fuel the civil war in the 1990s the obama administration pledged in its first term to negotiate a noninterference agreement among afghanistan s neighbors but that , too , has not happened , and the country remains vulnerable to meddling from outside history will not look kindly on the legacy of the us government and mr karzai in afghanistan but this also means that afghanistan s new leaders can do better , and now , simply by acting responsibly and working together to legitimize the results of this problematic election that has brought them to power the fourpage joint agreement between mr ghani and mr abdullah calls for convening a loya jirga , a traditional gathering of tribal representatives and elected district councilors , in the next two years in order to amend the constitution to reflect the recent creation of the chief executive post but a loya jirga should be called as soon as possible , so as to promptly give constitutional cover to the powersharing agreement between mr ghani and mr abdullah the assembly should also discuss how the present presidential system , which is highly centralized , could be improved and how electoral reforms can be made to prevent future voterigging and the gathering should be convened before the parliamentary elections scheduled for next year this would allow the legislators who are elected then to have some of the legitimacy that is lacking at present 2015 is supposed to mark the start of afghanistan s transformation decade but if the country is to even get to 2015 in one piece , its new leaders must act fast to correct course after the failed transformation of the last decade
washington convened a giant game of let s make a deal between the united states and africa on tuesday , bringing together nearly 50 african leaders with american investors for what he promised would be a longterm partnership that went beyond extracting minerals from the ground for our growth for mr obama , the son of a kenyan economist , it was the centerpiece of a threeday summit meeting of african leaders some close allies of the united states , others barely on speaking terms that is the president s most ambitious attempt to cement his legacy as an american leader who cares about the african continent our entire trade with all of africa is still only about equal to our trade with brazil , the president said i want africans buying more american products i want americans buying more african products i know you do , too , and that s what you 're doing today the african leaders seemed gratified by mr obama s sales pitch , which was echoed by a roster of boldface names from the business world , including the chief executives of general electric , cocacola and ibm and privateequity titans from blackstone and the carlyle group but the chamber of commerce vibe was disrupted just before mr obama spoke when some of the african leaders took umbrage to questions about the in west africa and the security threat from and other islamic militant groups it s an unfair vision of africa , said president macky sall of senegal , referring to western news reports about the outbreak is not an african disease , he said , speaking in french it is necessary to confront ebola as a threat to humanity tanzania s president , jakaya mrisho kikwete , noting that his country is in east africa , said that too often the whole of the african continent is perceived as if everywhere , everybody is suffering from ebola the presidents of liberia and sierra leone canceled their visits to the summit meeting to deal with the outbreak on monday , american health officials met quietly at the state department and with african officials from the affected countries to discuss their responses to the virus mr kikwete also played down a question from charlie rose , the cbs news anchor , about the threat posed by militants , saying that africa s two major trouble spots , somalia and darfur , sudan , had calmed down that drew a sharp retort from president moncef marzouki of tunisia , who cited continuing violence in sudan and northern mali we have to face the problems , but we have to work together , said mr marzouki , who returned from exile in france to run for president after tunisia s autocratic leader , , was ousted in the opening days of the arab spring in 2011 mr obama steered clear of the ebola outbreak or islamic militancy not to mention his own personal links to africa instead , his speech focused heavily on creating the right conditions for american companies to invest in africa he made a couple of announcements to jumpstart the effort , including 12 billion in new funding for the administration s power africa initiative , which aims to provide electricity to households across subsaharan africa with 26 billion in funding , mr obama said he had tripled the program s goal of reaching 60 million households he also promoted 14 billion in new investments by american companies in africa , including 5 billion from cocacola heeding requests from african leaders , he said the white house would work with congress to extend the , which grants trade preferences to subsaharan countries and expires next year with a narrative that has shifted from war and poverty to growth and development , mr obama extolled africa as an enticing opportunity for the united states though he did not mention china , he drew a clear distinction between the american approach and that of china , which has spent lavishly in africa to lock up sources of minerals we do n't look to africa simply for its natural resources , mr obama said we recognize africa for its greatest resource , which is its people and its talents and their potential but if mr obama sought to distance the united states from china , he delivered only a gentle admonition to the leaders about the need to curb corruption and install cleaner governments people should be able to start a business and ship their goods without having to pay a bribe or hiring someone s cousin , he said the conference was cosponsored by the commerce department and the foundation of former mayor of new york , who told reporters it has become unfashionable to be a business person in the us and africa desperately wants to build a business class because that s where the jobs are going to come from while the mood at the mandarin oriental hotel was buoyant , a few guests turned the tables on the united states mo ibrahim , a sudanborn cellphone tycoon , complained that american companies used legal techniques to dodge taxes in african countries where they have operations can you please also pay your taxes \? he said if you want to succeed longterm , you have to do clean business with its combination of marquee panelists and ironclad security , the meeting felt like a cross between the world economic forum at davos and a group of 20 summit meeting corporate chieftains , and celebrity guests like former president bill clinton , mixed easily with african leaders , while reporters covering the conference were penned behind a rope and allowed to move around only under escort none of the african leaders will get oneonone meetings with mr obama , but the white house arranged for vice president joseph r biden jr to meet with the leaders of south africa and nigeria on tuesday evening , however , mr obama and his wife , michelle , welcomed all the leaders to the south lawn of the white house , where they were serenaded by lionel richie and served a dinner of grilled beef with coconut milk , and cappuccino fudge cake with madagascar vanillascented papaya
for the first part of nicholas payton s career , he was effectively in the business of knocking you back in your chair these days he seems to want to make you lean forward instead the transition was n't sudden , not if you 've been attuned to his music over the last decade still , it can be a striking thing to absorb over the course of a set , like the one on thursday that began his fournight run at dizzy s club cocacola tweaking expectations is an essential part of the aesthetic process for mr payton when he emerged on the national scene some 20 years ago , he was held up as the latest in a line of thrilling young jazz trumpeters from new orleans he s now 41 , and has pushed back against most of those parameters , none more so than jazz , which he sees as a slur , a vestige of longstanding cultural oppression \( his disquisitions on the matter , going back a few years , can be found at \) mr payton s vision for bam for black american music , his approved term of art pointedly does away with genre classification numbers , the new album on his paytone label , features him mainly on a fender rhodes piano , playing a series of sketchlike tunes with , a grooveminded young band from richmond , va the trio appearing this week has vicente archer on bass and bill stewart on drums a lineup better suited to hardswinging exposition , but also at home with strutting funk mr payton occupied a corner of the stage , hemmed in by a rhodes and a grand piano , both of which he handled with skill his clanky touch was offset by his harmonic fluency and clarity of ideas on two , from the new album , he used his keyboard solo as a mounting preamble , bringing the pot to a boil before switching to trumpet right , trumpet mr payton did n't neglect his primary instrument , per se , but he was stingy with it when he did a solo on the horn , he favored terse riffbuilding over the more essayistic outpourings of yore \( even bam live at bohemian caverns , a trio album released last year , features a lot more trumpet than he played here \) so the most bracing moments came when he locked into a motif on trumpet and shadowed it on the fender rhodes , creating tricky arrangements on the fly he did this on mr stewart s tune 75 , and again on thelonious monk s straight , no chaser , after framing a pointillist reduction of the theme , all peekaboo syncopations another high point , unexpectedly , was a beseeching , quietstorm ballad featuring mr payton on vocals his singing has improved in recent years , so much so that his trumpet solo , when it came , felt merely like a welcome flourish rather than some kind of rescue mission
noah smith reminds us of a quartercenturyold diatribe by robert barro against the new keynesian economics , which is notable for its bitterness you can sort of see why people like barro had triumphantly declared keynes dead a decade earlier , and were evidently horrified to see even a mild version of keynesian ideas making a comeback but what s also striking is barro s evident inability to understand why these ideas didn t shrivel up and die the way they were supposed to his only answer was politics leftists looking for rationales for government intervention which is kind of funny when you realize that in its early days new keynesian economics included among its leading lights greg mankiw and john taylor also , the kind of intervention under discussion monetary policy was hardly the stuff of big government so why did so many macroeconomists feel that they needed to resurrect something keynesian in feel \? don t tell anyone , but they were looking at this thing called evidence just an aside noah seems to me to have a blind spot here , an urge toward nihilism on the question of evidence in macro i don t really see why the evidence that , at the very least , we don t live in a classical world is very strong , and in any normal science would long have been considered conclusive let s ask what the debate in the 80s and 90s was about it wasn t about fiscal policy , which only came back into central focus after we hit the zero lower bound instead , it was about monetary policy whether actions by central banks could drive economic fluctuations , or whether these were all real shocks of some kind keynesian models \( including the monetarist subclass , which isn t really very distinct in content as opposed to attitude \) argue that money has real effects because some wages and or prices are sticky in nominal terms \( this is not the same thing as arguing that increased price flexibility would help end recessions i ve written about that before , but just leave that on the side right now \) so , what evidence might you look for on the proposition that monetary policy can drive the real economy \? you could look for direct evidence of the asserted real effect preferably in the form of natural experiments , where there was a clear change in policy and you could track the outcome alternatively or additionally , you could look for evidence of nominal stickiness and by the mid1980s there was already overwhelming evidence of both kinds romer and romer hadn t yet published their classic eventstudy demonstration that money matters , but as they said , their methodology was largely based on the work of a guy named milton friedman and the mother of all romerromer natural experiments took place when paul volcker first tightened policy to break the back of inflation , then loosened it when he thought we had suffered enough the results the worst recession since the 30s , followed by a roaring recovery were pretty decisive i remember , during our time at the cea in 19823 , someone making a new classical argument , and larry summers saying something like aren t 12 million unemployed enough reason to stop listening to this nonsense \? meanwhile , on nominal stickiness there was the evidence from real exchange rate behavior , where nominal and real rates not only moved in tandem , but realrate behavior changed totally when the exchange rate regime changed and there was clear evidence from surveys both that there was a spike in the distribution of wage changes at zero and that employers believed that nominal wage cuts were very costly for morale all of this evidence has , of course , only grown stronger since seriously if this were a normal scholarly field , can you imagine a large part of the profession not only ignoring this evidence but doing all it could to excommunicate anyone trying to face reality \? and no , i m not engaged in hyperbole remember , it was ken rogoff , not me , who wrote about bearing the scars of new neoclassical repression so my take on macro is that we have plenty of evidence about what kind of approach works and that approach really does work , giving lots of useful guidance in fact , the empirical evidence for basic macro propositions is better than that for most of micro ! the problem is that so many macroeconomists refuse to see the obvious
denver the musicians stuck to the classics at the colorado symphony s firstever classically cannabis fundraiser on friday night they played strauss and wagner , not marley and garcia their only concessions to the evening s marijuana theme , it seemed , were the bright green ties they wore with their black suits this is not some big ganja fest , said justin bartels , the principal trumpeter for the denverbased symphony this is very respectable as attendees swirled through an art gallery here just south of downtown , clinking glasses of wine and ducking through an open door to a rainy patio to light up a joint , the brass quintet ran through popular selections by puccini and debussy , playing on in a corner as the unmistakable smell of marijuana smoke filled the echoing space the symphony s event was one more sign that marijuana has begun slipping into the cultural mainstream here , five months after colorado became the first state to allow recreational sales of the drug to adults 21 and older in addition to hundreds of marijuana retailers and growers across the state , several companies offer marijuana tours through denver and into the mountains the denver post runs a bustling website , , devoted to all things marijuana there are marijuanafriendly speeddating events and cooking classes devoted to marijuanathemed recipes and this spring , the denver county fair will feature an adultsonly pot pavilion , albeit one without any actual marijuana plants on the premises \( oregano will have to suffice for a jointrolling contest \) friday s event was organized by a marijuanathemed event promoter , and sponsored by a cannabissoil company and a handful of marijuana sellers for the , the bringyourownmarijuana event offered a novel way to raise 50 , 000 at a moment when it is contending with financial struggles and a battle over rent at its cityowned concert venue for us , it s just another fundraiser , said evan lasky , the symphony s chief operating officer performing arts are struggling some board members objected to a fundraiser sponsored by an industry that sells a drug still outlawed by the federal government and a majority of states , and mr lasky said he had received a few outraged emails , though none from patrons but mr lasky said the sponsors had a straightforward pitch they operated legal businesses in colorado , had money and wanted to support the arts if the symphony s chamber ensemble could perform a beethoven and beer fundraiser , mr lasky said , why not classically cannabis the high note series \? at first , the symphony sold tickets , but it was forced to refund those sales and recast the fundraiser as a private , invitationonly affair after denver officials raised objections , saying the performance could violate laws against the public consumption of marijuana despite the drug s legality , it is illegal to consume marijuana on the street or in public parks , bars , restaurants or any other public spaces , and the police in cities like denver and boulder have cracked down on public consumption in recent months denver officials warned that they could try to halt the symphony s cannabis event and hold its organizers and sponsors responsible for violating any publicconsumption prohibitions in response , the symphony stripped information about the cannabis concert from its website , refunded ticket sales and agreed to limit attendees to a closed list of guests set by the organizer the outdoor patio where guests smoked marijuana was sheathed in plastic to shield guests from street view we were very careful , mr lasky said there are two more cannabissponsored fundraisers scheduled for the summer , including an outdoor concert at the amphitheater in the foothills west of denver marijuana consumption is banned at that venue , though many concertgoers would testify that the prohibition is loosely enforced as the chamber quintet performed , the guests many of them connected to the marijuana industry inspected the art , pinned marijuanaleaf pins to their dresses and suit lapels , and talked about business in this new frontier of commerce leslie bryant , 23 , a law student who emphasized that she and her fianc had planned ahead for a cab ride home , surveyed the scene from an upstairs balcony she said the evening was a good excuse to dress up and add a grace note of culture to a recreational undertaking usually associated with someone s basement or concerthall bathrooms it can be sophisticated , she said it does n't have to be about stoners a few tables away , phil cherner , a criminaldefense lawyer , said the evening was about as mainstream as you could get the goal of the project was to make marijuana boring , said they 've succeeded it s classical music , a glass of wine , a toke

361 and 176 after five minutes , novoa traded three of his stickers for a random pack of five , but the pack turned out to have none of his missing stickers on his 10th try , novoa found his argentine team card , for which he traded two player cards traders can buy individual cards from hundreds of distributors across the city , but most agree that is not as fun people ask me why i do n't just buy the ones i need , novoa said i guess there s a bit of romanticism in me buying is not the real way to do it i want to fill the album through trading trading techniques vary some use handwritten lists

people are n't going to try to make money off this craze he said many stickers have also entered illegally from neighboring venezuela and panama carmen alicia contreras nieto , an authorized distributor in colombia who works at the university of the andes in bogot , said supply had failed to meet demand this year she is part of an intricate sales chain there are large distributors who invest hundreds of thousands of dollars and make bulk sales , and there are streetlevel vendors who largely sell by the card or the pack the larger the quantity sold , the larger the distributor s cut of the earnings in the first month , we sold the same quantity that we sold four years ago in the entire season , contreras said so we 're waiting and waiting for more product to arrive she said the albums and stickers had not yet hit many small cities and towns across colombia , which would further fuel demand you earn from this , but we have n't moved the money we were hoping to move , she said people call us , and we do n't have , we do n't have , we do n't have , and then the day the products arrive , we sell out ruosi , panini s representative , was expected to travel to colombia this month to analyze sales and demand on the streets of bogot , traders did not seem concerned about supply running out they were far more concerned with finishing their albums before the june 12 start of the cup it will give me serious bragging rights over my friends and a certain amount of pride , novoa said it s also a really nice souvenir of the world cup by midafternoon , novoa was missing just one sticker bresciano , the australian midfielder the plaza was largely cleared out because traders had returned to work , but novoa stayed he tried his luck on one man who had just arrived maybe you have the one card i'm missing , novoa said 176 the man looked through his stickers and pulled out what novoa needed with a smile , novoa accepted and offered 10 stickers in return , out of gratitude for helping me complete the album , he said the two then posed for a photograph as he walked away , smiling , novoa said he was proud to have filled it the right way finishing is bittersweet , he said

missilesize cigar , and a discussion , played for laughs , of reported north korean propaganda claims that none of the kim leaders defecate within days , the north korean foreign ministry slammed the film as intolerable , as well as the most blatant act of terrorism and an act of war , and threatened merciless retaliation if it was released the next day the north korean military launched three shortrange ballistic missiles into the sea , as if to hint , see what i mean \? the lesson never underestimate the power of marijuana in hollywood , and phallic jokes about rockets and cigars it seems absurd for the leader of a nuclear state to be so incensed over an anarchic comedy by the guys who brought you this is the end and pineapple express but movies have held inordinate importance in north korean politics , beginning even before the country s founding in 1948 one of the earliest actions by kim ilsung , called great leader , was to create a sovietsupported national film studio , where he gave filmmakers and crews preferential food rations and housing his son , , called dear leader , was a film buff who owned one of the largest private film collections in the world and whose first position of power was in running the regime s propaganda apparatus , including its film studios for over 20 years he micromanaged every new north korean film production , as writer , producer , executive and critic to his people , he is still known today first and foremost thanks to propaganda rather than any real talent or skill as the greatest creative genius in s history the dear leader was less quick to take offense than his son kim jongun is today partly because , at least early on , he preferred threats he could follow up on in those days , north korean covert operatives still had the knowhow to hijack a plane , bomb a state function , and target a south korean president also , taking offense would have been an obvious case of the pot calling the kettle black most of his productions treated foreigners , americans especially , the way mr rogen , mr franco and mr goldberg treat kim jongun as cartoonish stock baddies north korean films of the 1980s are full of western villains , usually admirals or colonels , with dr evil bald heads and names like dr kelton or her majesty s officer louis london these characters all hatched devious schemes to destroy north korea and take over the world for the white house as north korea had no western actors to speak of , they were first played by koreans in heavily caked whiteface makeup later on , american defectors and foreign prisoners , diplomats or visiting businessmen were persuaded to come into the studio for a day or a week and paste a monocle and fake mustache on for the cameras and dialoguedubbers like mr rogen and mr goldberg s work , mr kim s films could be hilarious but it was always unintentional north koreans do n't do comedy to try and make someone laugh you must be ready for them not to take you seriously , something all three generations of kim rulers have been unable to do where pyongyang s propaganda billboards used to threaten war if north korea was invaded or attacked , now they warn foreigners not to interfere with our selfrespect as a character type , kim jongun may be difficult to place educated in switzerland , he is a basketball fan and alleged computer nerd his wife is pyongyang s equivalent of kate middleton , and there are hopes he may yet open up the hermit kingdom but oops , there he goes again , testing ballistic missiles , executing his own uncle , and letting his press agents call his south korean counterpart a filthy comfort woman one thing is clear mr kim deals in perception , not reality his father and grandfather tried to assert that north korea was the more legitimate and successful of the two koreas that battle was lost a long time ago now the grandson and his theater state must act as if his country still has any reason to exist , and so his first job is to sustain that illusion however , like any person whose keenest concern is not to be laughed at , north korea has quickly become ridiculous and , from its position of weakness and impotence , only more prone to take offense last year , the north korean regime issued no threats of war or destruction when the hollywood action thriller olympus has fallen featured north korean commandos attacking the white house it had no problem being portrayed as rogue , dangerous or aggressive but funny that s taking it too far kim jongil s movies and operas , architecture , mosaics , music , news reports , documentaries , stage performances , all of them part of an elaborate propagandistic visual language built a worldview for his citizens in which north koreans were both the purest race on earth and the last people bravely resisting yankee imperialism the fear , for his son , is that films like the interview are contributing to another narrative one in which north korea is laughable and irrelevant mr rogen and mr franco s film will not be released in north korea , but with more and more chinese bootleg dvds turning up in rural north korean markets every day , and with the teenage youth of the north korean elite spending their holidays in japan gorging on western music , cinema and porn , kim jongun and his cronies are surely worried what will happen to him when the walls separating his people from the rest of the world finally come down , and the north korean people realize that the kims were never great or dear at all , only an appalling , criminal joke \?

san jose , calif as hopscotched the california coast this week on a fundraising trip for democratic candidates and other causes , he used one of the glittering events to offer a candid meditation on the powers of the presidency and its limits he spoke of the abductions of hundreds of girls by a terrorist group in , and he mentioned the civil war in and the suffering imposed on its people but he acknowledged that it was not clear how far he should go in using american power to respond to such atrocities i have this remarkable title right now president of the united states , he said wednesday night in los angeles and yet every day when i wake up , and i think about young girls in nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in syria when there are times in which i want to reach out and save those kids and having to think through what levers , what power do we have at any given moment it was an unusual confession for a president , and mr obama made it at an event where he was receiving an award , presented by the director steven spielberg , for his efforts in fighting genocide around the world the use of american power as some in washington have insisted is called for in nigeria and syria is not enough , and it is not the only option , mr obama said instead , he said , by keeping memories alive , by telling stories , by hearing those stories , we can do our part to save lives i think drop by drop by drop that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive , that we can tell a different story , the president said the dinner was held for the university of southern california s shoah foundation , which mr spielberg founded 20 years ago to document genocides like the holocaust and raise enough global awareness to prevent others none of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the holocaust , mr obama said but , he added , they demand our attention , that we not turn away , that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action and that s not always easy mr obama talked about the german industrialist oskar schindler a member of the nazi party who was the subject of mr spielberg s oscarwinning movie schindler s list schindler saved more than 1 , 000 jews who worked in one of his factories from falling into the nazis' hands , but was a reluctant hero still , mr obama said , schindler demonstrated that we have to act even where there is sometimes ambiguity even when the path is not always clearly lit , we have to try , he said in the audience for mr obama s speech was liam neeson , who played schindler in the moviebut even as the president traveled around california , the events surrounding the disappearance of hundreds of girls in nigeria kidnapped by the islamist militant group boko haram was demanding the attention of the white house there were insistent calls that the united states play an active role in finding the children and punishing the terrorists the united states has offered military and law enforcement assistance to the nigerian government , but has played only an advisory role so far with that crisis in the background , the white house on thursday pushed back on the notion that mr obama had shown in the los angeles speech that he felt powerless even though he leads the most powerful country in the world in a briefing with reporters in los angeles , josh earnest , the deputy white house press secretary , said the president s words had shown his determination to use american power as a force for good in the world i think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there s a lot of evil in the world , that there are a lot of bad things happening , mr earnest said , and that every morning you 're waking up and there s a new thing that s coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21stcentury world mr earnest said that did not mean that the united states should use military force in every global crisis but what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the nigerian government to track those girls down , he said and just because he did n't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found , it does n't mean that we should stop or give up
magnum opus so far is a sitcomsatire called stealing beauty \( 2007 \) , which he shot guerrilla style in ikea stores on different continents with his wife and children in show , mr ben ner picks up many of the same threads , but the work is injected with a new pathos in foreign names \( 2012 \) , mr ben ner visited nearly 100 aroma coffee shops \( an israeli chain \) , left a fake name in english that would be called out at the counter when his beverage was ready , then edited all the videotaped segments to create an ode lamenting the disappearance of waiters it s a slightly confusing work , held together primarily by subtitles , but furthers his practice of hacking the apparatus of global capitalism in subtle , humorous ways soundtrack \( 2013 \) , the centerpiece of the show , takes a scene from steven spielberg s 2005 movie war of the worlds as a readymade soundtrack and pairs it with footage shot in mr ben ner s kitchen in tel aviv smashing plates and combusting appliances replace mr spielberg s highbudget alien apocalypse the documentary filmmaker avi mograbi emerges from the refrigerator at one point , while video of recent israeli conflicts appears on a nearby laptop screen the war of the worlds ethos runs deeper , though like tom cruise s character in that movie , mr ben ner s children from his first marriage play a pivotal role in soundtrack , billed alongside the cute baby from his second marriage the artist s family situation would be none of our business except that , like sitcom audiences , we 've literally watched his kids grow up on screen in that sense , soundtrack might be an art analogue to war of the worlds as well as a sequel to stealing beauty in which familial bliss is ruptured and plays itself out on embattled ground

not long ago , russia s onceheralded biathlon program was in tatters the team was plagued with doping violations it was losing big competitions to countries it expected to beat , like belarus and kazakhstan of trying to arrange the murder of a local governor what a difference an oligarch makes out of all the titles juggles nets owner , billionaire playboy , russian presidential candidate perhaps the most unlikely is this biathlon federation president russia s biathlon team used to be among the most fearsome in the world the men s relay held a lock on the olympic gold medal from 1968 to 1988 but the program turned ragged in recent years enter mr prokhorov he took the helm of the biathlon federation in 2008 , a year after sochi , russia , was selected to host the games , and has showered the team with money just as he has in brooklyn with the nets he has turned the program into a goldplated machine in hopes of reestablishing russian dominance when the olympics open next month mr prokhorov is paying for the biathlon team to travel to sochi on three private jets , said sergey kushchenko , a top biathlon official and a longtime prokhorov deputy mr prokhorov has recently given personal bonuses to biathlon athletes , coaches and managers , he added , though he declined to describe the size of the gifts under mr prokhorov , the team has hired one of the world s bestknown coaches from germany , along with battalions of staff road accommodations have improved a notch or several for prokhorov , it is very important to allow his sportsmen , those guys on the international team , to think and focus only on the training and the competition and not think about the beds or something , mr kushchenko said mr prokhorov is one of several highpowered russian executives often called oligarchs to assume a measure of responsibility for a winter sport in anticipation of the sochi games the tycoons have brought their connections , expertise , and , most important , unfathomably deep pockets to once obscure athletic organizations , altering the international competitive landscape andrei bokarev , a coal mining billionaire , is the president of the freestyle skiing federation alexei kravstov , the chief executive of kraftway , one of the country s biggest information technology companies , is the president of the skating organization vagit alekperov , the president of lukoil , a leading russian oil company , has made his company a top sponsor of the crosscountry ski team did they volunteer for olympic service , or were they enlisted \? as always , the relationships between the kremlin and the business world are murky at best , and political analysts can only speculate on precisely how the billionaires ended up working with the sports federations mr kushchenko put it like this in our country everybody wants to win , and that is why it was decided that the best executives in the country would run some sports organizations a lot of executives from the business side now joined and head most of the federations the executives' involvement signals just how important the games are to president , who has spent years , and tens of billions of dollars in government funds , to burnish russia s international standing with a good showing at the olympics the biathlon , which combines crosscountry skiing with sharpshooting , could be seen as a case study for russia s olympic ambitions after decades of dominance , the team s reputation was tainted by doping scandals and the 2007 criminal conviction of alexander tikhonov , a former olympic great who was mr prokhorov s predecessor at the biathlon federation \( mr tikhonov , who denies charges that he hired his brother to kill a local official , was sentenced to three years in prison but was immediately released under an amnesty law \) it was during that nadir that mr prokhorov , who made his fortune in nickel mining , became the president of the russian biathlon union at 6 feet 8 inches , mr prokhorov has a wellknown passion for basketball and heliskiing , but mr kushchenko could not say whether his boss had any previous experience with the biathlon \( he did point out , jokingly , that both basketball and biathlon start with the letter b \) he said mr prokhorov , who declined to be interviewed for this article , was motivated by patriotism national pride comes first russia s newly flush team has been closely watched on the biathlon circuit , drawing envy and resentment norway , germany and france have strong biathlon programs , but none has resources to match russia mr kushchenko would not put a number on the biathlon team s budget but said it combined financing from the government and mr prokhorov in the united states , biathlon ranks somewhere below an afterthought tim burke , perhaps the best american biathlete in a generation , does not exactly have to worry about the paparazzi although american olympic sports do receive some financing through corporate sponsorships , american athletes look at russia s glittering resources and sigh the russians travel with an enormous team , more coaches and staff than athletes , mr burke said they fly a lot in their private jets from world cup to world cup the american biathlon budget does not allow for luxury air travel it s about 16 million for the olympics , said max cobb , the president of us biathlon i suspect that the russian budget is probably 10 times that amount , he said he added it s definitely daunting they 're exceptionally well provided for by comparison , us biathlon is a threadbare organization the office manager works half the week an accountant works six hours a week the group can afford a third employee only because of an outside grant we 're all stretched to the limit , mr cobb said i'm pretty sure we 're the leanest staff of any olympic sport that has a reasonable chance of winning a medal when mr cobb surveys the biathlon world , one extremely tall russian stands out prokhorov has totally changed it , he said the russians were well funded before , he added now they 're wellfunded times two it s not just the americans who have noticed martin fourcade of france , the topranked biathlete , who is expected to dominate in sochi , said it was impossible to ignore the financial resources of the russian team are huge , he said in an interview he ticked off their advantages premier travel accommodations , exercise bikes on the road , large coaching staffs it s a lot of good details , but nothing can make them win for sure , he said one of mr prokhorov s biggest challenges was to clean up the federation after a series of doping scandals in 2009 , three russian biathletes were suspended after testing positive for a bloodboosting hormone cracking down on doping was a major priority , mr kushchenko said , and international officials have applauded russia s efforts mr prokhorov has taken the problems with doping in russian biathlon very seriously , said anders besseberg , the president of the international biathlon union in brooklyn , mr prokhorov has been criticized for being an absentee owner of the nets , but he seems to have taken to the role of biathlon cheerleader bravo , bravo , and once again bravo , he wrote on this month after the russian women won a world cup competition in germany the showing offered hope for future russian victories , and not only in sports for all the huzzahs , mr prokhorov knows that he will be judged ultimately by one measure olympic gold medals he has said that he will resign if the russian team does not win at least two in sochi the russians have a competitive team , but gold is not a sure bet of the top 15 ranked international male biathletes , four are russian of the top 15 women , only two are russian as for the russian athletes themselves , they seem to have enjoyed the prokhorov era with the arrival of the new leadership , we were able to relax a little and not worry how we were going to make it tomorrow to one or another location or what we would eat during the world championships and the olympic games , maxim chudov , then the team captain , said in an interview in 2010 mr prokhorov and his managers think they have done their part now it s up to the biathletes the russian national team got all the best equipment and all the best funding to perform best , mr kushchenko said we 'll see how it works
for more than 100 years , baseball looked pretty much the same from the grandstands there were three players spread in the outfield , a pitcher on the mound , a catcher behind the plate , and four infielders neatly aligned , two on each side of second base but a radical reworking of defensive principles is reshaping the way the old game is played , and even the way it looks if you cannot find the third baseman , he might be the one standing in shallow right field the second baseman \? that s him on the other side of the diamond , next to the shortstop some baseball positions as they have long been known are changing before our eyes the cause is the infield shift , a phenomenon exploding this year as more teams are using statistical analysis and embracing a dynamic approach to previously static defenses now , armed with evidence that shows how a batter has a propensity to hit the ball to certain parts of the field , teams will position their infielders accordingly at times taking them far from their traditional spots the shift is on the verge of becoming the norm , said joe maddon , the manager of the and one of the early leading proponents of the shift when you 're not shifting now is almost going to be the anomaly defense from 2010 to 2013 , infield shifts steadily increased , according to research by baseball info solutions , which tracks every shift and the number of runs it saves but from 2013 to this season , the rate of shifting in the major leagues has mushroomed last year there were 8 , 134 shifts on balls in play through the weekend , teams had already shifted 3 , 213 times , putting them on pace for nearly 14 , 000 for the season teams that shift regularly are lowering opposing teams' batting averages by 30 to 40 points on grounders and low line drives you do it because it works , said mark teixeira , the yankees first baseman as a batter , he has been a victim of the shift for the past few years , perhaps explaining , in part , why his batting average went from 290 over his first four years in baseball to 249 since 2010 , when teams began shifting on him regularly ben jedlovec is the senior vice president for product development and sales at baseball info solutions , a company that was started by john dewan , the author of the book the fielding bible the company tracks every pitch and every play and provides software and tools to about twothirds of major league teams there s no end in sight , jedlovec said about teams' willingness to employ the shift at first , the natural targets of the shift were sluggers like david ortiz , jim thome , adam dunn and ryan howard all big lefthanded hitters who regularly pull the ball to the right now , with statistical analysis influencing more managers' decisions , even lightly regarded hitters like kelly johnson of the yankees might see fielders shifting against them , and more righthanded hitters are seeing the shift as well baseball is n't big on change , said dewan , who began advocating defensive shifts about 10 years ago but once other managers and teams saw the rays doing it successfully , perhaps they did n't feel as if they were going out on a limb so much , and would n't be criticized when someone happens to get a hit against the shift following the rays , the have embraced the shift with zeal , from the depths of their minor leagues up to the majors as of the weekend they had employed 368 shifts , more than one per inning and far more than any other team , even the rays it s an epiphany , maddon said i much preferred it when all the other teams did n't want to do those things the astros began employing the shift early last year but the pitchers objected , saying they did not feel comfortable with a defense overloaded to one side of the infield and a gaping hole on the other the astros' management backed off , but it did not give up in spring training , the astros' general manager , jeff luhnow , and his coaching staff came armed with data , presented it to the pitchers and discussed why they wanted to embrace the shift that analysis included a look at the improved defense of the pittsburgh pirates over the previous two seasons the pirates had mostly the same infielders in those two years , and in 2012 the sum of players involved in double plays was 339 \( a 643 double play would count as three \) , 13th in the national league but in 2013 , with the shift , the sum of players involved in double plays was 419 , the fourth most in the league their pitchers' earned run average dropped to 326 from 386 the astros pitchers were persuaded , and baseball info solutions estimated the shift had saved them 11 runs so far this year houston now uses the shift all the way down to its class a club we 're confident that it s helped us get more outs than we would have without it , luhnow said the yankees are second to the astros with 223 defensive shifts in 2014 they were already steadily increasing their shifts over the past few seasons , but during the offseason their quantitative analysis department , headed by david grabiner and michael fishman , was assigned to the matter they eventually proposed a comprehensive plan that now has players in the majors and the minors shifting like never before but as much as the shift is blossoming this year , it is hardly a new phenomenon there is evidence of the shift going back more than 130 years artwork suggests that before the 1880s , basemen would stand on top of the bases according to tom shieber , a historian at the baseball hall of fame , that was because of different foulball rules that made first and third basemen responsible for greater swaths of foul territory once those rules changed in the mid1880s , players took up the now familiar positions but even back then , there were innovators shieber said that one of his colleagues at the hall of fame , bill francis , recently discovered evidence of an infield shift in a june 25 , 1870 , account in the new york clipper of a game between the atlantics of brooklyn and the cincinnati red stockings the cincinnati fielders moved about in the field , according as the different batsmen came to bat , the clipper story said , noting that it was innovative the most famous shift of the 20th century was used by cleveland indians manager lou boudreau against ted williams , the boston red sox lefthanded slugger , in july 1946 , although there are accounts of a shift against williams dating to 1941 an earlier williams , cy , was a victim of the shift in the 1920s , and in japan teams used the ohshiftu against sadaharu oh in 1964 in his memoir , boudreau said the shift was about not only defense but also the batter s psychology maddon agreed you are trying to split someone s desires , his concentration , his thoughts , maddon said it s a psychological ploy as well they grew up looking out from the batter s box and the infield had a certain look to it now when you look out there , people are in different places how s that going to affect you in that atbat \? what are the risks of shifting \? none , maddon said some might disagree last year at fenway park , robinson cano bunted toward an empty third base against a boston red sox shift and ended up with a double but maddon pointed out that if cano or any other dangerous hitter preferred to bunt , that was ok with him better a bunt than a home run dewan , the head of baseball info solutions , said his company did not recommend shifting in the outfield because the data suggested that even pull hitters tended to hit the ball in the air to the outfield either straight away or even to the opposite field roughly 54 percent of the time and the risks can be too great a ball that lands against a shifted outfield could conceivably go for an insidethepark home run by the time anyone runs it down dewan also did not recommend shifting the infield too often with men on base because it could leave fielders out of position to cover bases in a recent game at angels stadium , the yankees could not cover first base on a bunt because the second baseman was shifted too far up the middle luhnow , the astros' general manager , said that as teams saw more of the shift , they might discover ways to beat it bobby valentine agrees when he managed the mets in 1999 , he had his infielder run to set positions as the pitcher was delivering he said that could be put into use by teams who want to disguise their defense until the last moment , much like a football team hiding its blitz someone will come up with something new , valentine said it will probably be joe maddon
on the campaign trail earlier this year , india s prime minister , narendra modi , appealed to voters by promising to combat corruption and clean up politics he was rewarded with a huge national electoral victory as well as success in state elections last month yet on monday , mr modi substantially reneged on these commitments when he named 21 new members to his cabinet according to reuters , the appointees include at least five people charged with such serious offenses as rape and rioting a total of seven are facing prosecution ram shankar katheria , who was named junior education minister , has been accused of more than 20 criminal offenses including attempted murder and the promotion of religious or racial hostility finance minister arun jaitley dismissed suggestions that there are criminals in the cabinet as completely baseless he drew an odd distinction , telling reporters these are cases arising out of criminal accusations , not cases of a crime meanwhile , a spokesman for mr modi s ruling bharatiya janata party said it was up to the courts to decide such cases and attributed many of the charges to political rivalries he s right that the courts should decide guilt or innocence and it may not be unusual for political rivals to make accusations against one another it is also true that the overtaxed indian system often drags prosecutions out for years , delaying justice but none of the above means that allegations of criminal wrongdoing should be ignored according to the association for democratic reforms in india , about one third of federal and state legislators face charges , and amazingly politicians facing criminal charges are twice as likely to win election as those who are not at a minimum , mr modi s decision to bring such tainted individuals into his government creates a bad impression and raises legitimate questions among voters who have demanded a government that respects the rule of law in a country where many people have lost faith in democratic governance , mr modi also pledged to lead a small yet effective government , yet his 21 new appointees bring the cabinet to 66 , not so very different from that of his last two predecessors some argue that since mr modi has effectively centralized power in his office , the cabinet appointees are not that important but he told indians he was a different kind of leader is he or is he not \?
tewksbury , mass with a crippling job action enveloping the new england supermarket chain market basket for a third week , the company s board is conducting roundtheclock negotiations with its former president and others in search of a deal that will quell the turmoil but the bid by the former chief , arthur t demoulas , to buy the company is mired in uncertainty , according to people close to the negotiations and the board is weighing nearly a dozen offers , including one that is higher than mr demoulas s , these people said the sale could be worth more than 35 billion while the board bargains with bidders behind closed doors , employees continue to stage public rallies to demand that artie t , as he is known , be brought back to run the company he was deposed as president in june in the latest chapter of a decadeslong feud with his cousin , arthur s demoulas , who now controls market basket , one of new england s most successful retail chains arthur t demoulas s ouster prompted thousands of employees to take to the streets and demand his reinstatement customers have been swept up in the action , too , and are boycotting the chain , which owns 71 stores in maine , massachusetts and new hampshire market basket is said to be losing millions of dollars a week in sales the shelves are devoid of fresh produce , meat and dairy products supplies of nonperishables are dwindling , too , as if a huge snowstorm had struck at the store in north andover , mass , where 21 registers are usually open and customers clog the aisles , only one register was open on monday , and the cashier there had no customers mike dunleavy , the store director in somerville , mass , said volume at his store had dropped 90 percent vendors , growers , drivers and others in market basket s supply chain have all felt the pinch several top managers have been fired , and the company has threatened to replace some of its other 25 , 000 full and parttime workers for the most part , though , employees are still going to work and being paid , but there is little for them to do without food to sell or customers to serve on tuesday , thousands of workers and customers held their fourth rally , this one at a suburban shopping plaza here in tewksbury under a scorching sun organizers , who had called for 15 , 000 people , estimated the crowd at 10 , 000 the police declined to give an estimate the protesters were digging in their heels , saying they would continue to demand arthur t demoulas s reinstatement for as long as it took to bring him back i should have been at work today , but this is where i belong , said eric haviland , 41 , an assistant store director in lee , nh , who attended the rally if they want to replace me , by all means , come get me we 're not afraid the ousted president , who has kept out of public view since he was deposed , announced late last month that he had made a bid to buy the 505 percent of market basket that he and his allies in the demoulas family do not already own but the confrontation over his reinstatement has complicated his bid for the company , according to people close to the process , who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly despite owning nearly half the company , they said , arthur t demoulas is the only bidder who needs financing to buy it \( other suitors include national supermarket chains and big investment firms \) but potential lenders are wary of providing financing to him until the stores are up and running he could conceivably call for workers to drop their protest and customers to return to the stores , but he would not be guaranteed of winning the company and could lose his leverage in the process market basket , which had sales last year of 46 billion , has long been attractive to other suitors , and some made bids for it even before the president s ouster surprisingly , people close to the process said , none of the bids has been lowered so far , although many expect that with the stores now hemorrhaging , the value of the company will diminish still , some members of the board believe that selling to arthur t demoulas would be the best option , according to people briefed on the matter given his support among store employees , the reasoning goes , he would be in a good position to end the standoff and , they said , members of his cousin s faction have expressed interest in selling even to arthur t demoulas but it is not entirely clear whether arthur t demoulas s coalition within the demoulas family is fully on board with his bid , one of these people said some on his side have shown signs of willingness to sell their holdings instead of buying out their relatives' stakes other bidders have no such problems the board is in advanced talks with at least one other bidder whose financing is not in question , these people said and this party s current offer is worth more than arthur t demoulas s , they said some prospective bidders have said that they could squeeze more profits out of the company , since management under arthur t demoulas has shown little inclination to maximize profitability \( he unilaterally rolled out a 4 percent discount on goods within the store late last year , arguing that customers could use the money more than his fellow shareholders \) the board , which has hired an investment bank to oversee the sales process , is to make a recommendation to shareholders , who will then decide on a course of action no one has said when the standoff might end or when it must end to avoid the company s complete collapse but analysts said that the longer the stalemate continued , the more precipitously the company s value would drop and the more difficult it would be to rebuild although turnout at tuesday s rally may have been disappointing to protesters in terms of numbers , they were joined by local politicians , and all expressed their resolve gov maggie hassan of new hampshire has issued supportive statements on behalf of the workers but gov deval patrick of massachusetts has declined to comment , saying that the matter is a private dispute

peabody , mass representative john f tierney , an embattled nineterm democrat , knows about tough races a lawyer from salem , mr tierney first ran for congress in 1994 from this district on the north shore of boston and lost narrowly to the republican incumbent he returned for a grudge match in 1996 and beat the incumbent in one of the closest contests in the country after recounts that stretched into december , mr tierney was declared the winner by just 371 votes out of more than 260 , 000 cast for more than a decade , mr tierney , who prides himself on his constituent service , won reelection handily but in 2012 he found himself in another squeaker in the end , he edged out his republican opponent by one percentage point now , mr tierney , 62 , is bracing for another fight for his political life roll call last year listed him as one of the , and in an update last month said he remains vulnerable in his primary , but more so in his general election and this time , he has to jump through two hoops first , he faces four fellow democrats , including one particularly strong opponent , in the primary on tuesday if mr tierney prevails , he faces the same republican who nearly beat him in 2012 mr tierney dismissed the idea that the primary had posed problems for him it s allowed us to organize earlier , he said in an interview , adding that he expected to be reelected in november i 've got leadership positions on the committees that are going to be dealing with those important matters , from pay to pension to labor issues still , his opponents smell blood in the water mr tierney was weakened in 2010 when his wife , patrice , was with her brothers and was sentenced to a month in jail running against an extreme and littleknown republican , mr tierney easily won but by 2012 , he had a stronger opponent a moderate and openly gay republican named richard tisei and national republicans spent heavily to make the scandal a major issue in the campaign mr tierney barely won , even as president obama carried this district of wealthy suburbs and faded industrial cities by 11 percentage points many analysts say that mr obama pulled mr tierney across the finish line there is no such booster factor to help him this year but the democratic establishment , including senator elizabeth warren and organized labor , has rallied around mr tierney , a liberal who is a close ally of the house minority leader , nancy pelosi the democratic congressional campaign committee has put him in , which supports vulnerable democrats and he has history on his side successful primaries against house incumbents in massachusetts are rare , with the last one 22 years ago none of this has discouraged seth moulton , 35 , a wellfinanced , harvardeducated marine veteran who served four tours of duty in iraq and was a mr moulton , the strongest of the four democrats challenging mr tierney , is leveraging voter discontent with congress , his status as a veteran and his relative youth to draw longtime tierney supporters to his side last month , as the recipient of an honor for military veterans , he had the chance to at fenway park in full military uniform and wave to tens of thousands of cheering spectators moulton would be the democrats' dream candidate in just about any other district in the country , said david wasserman , who studies house races for the nonpartisan but here , he has aggravated the establishment he s forced tierney to divert attention and resources from a very competitive general election to a primary , mr wasserman said he s become democratic strategists' nightmare until very recently , mr tierney tended to ignore mr moulton even as mr moulton turned up the heat , mr tierney s camp has tried to look past this week s primary and focused instead on the november election against mr tisei mr moulton , who seems to have few policy differences with mr tierney , has focused on what he says is mr tierney s donothing record in congress congressman tierney is one of the least effective congressmen in the whole country , mr moulton said in an interview after a debate here in a negative television ad , mr moulton asserts that mr tierney has passed only one bill , has missed more votes than most other members and was fined for unspecified illegal campaign activities at a recent debate here , mr tierney said mr moulton s allegation about his productivity was utter nonsense he said he had worked on numerous bills , they just did not bear his name at a debate in bedford , mass , he acknowledged problems in congress , and blamed the republicans , sounding as if he were campaigning in a general election the problem is john boehner , and his farright republicans ca n't get issues to the floor , mr tierney said afterward , renee keaney , a retired clinical social worker from marblehead , said she was sticking with mr tierney i'm glad to see another generation getting involved , she said of mr moulton i just think this is the wrong race , because we 've got a good candidate but mimi hollister , a retired minister , also from marblehead , said she was supporting mr moulton john tierney s been great , she said i 've supported him for many years but i think now we need a change , because congress is so dysfunctional in recent days , mr moulton pulled off a rare coup by being endorsed by both and , whose editorial boards rarely agree the herald called mr tierney utterly reprehensible , without specifying why the globe knocked him for his staunch defense of congress s business as usual while saying that mr moulton s work in iraq negotiating with warlords , developing ontheground relationships in tense circumstances might bode well for his ability to deal with recalcitrant republicans not until last tuesday , a week before the primary , did mr tierney finally turn his fire on mr moulton he in which he essentially accused mr moulton of being a republican and linked him with the national rifle association , the and opponents of abortion rights mr moulton called the ad absurd the salem news , which , called the ad repugnant and said now was the time for new leadership there is no reliable polling in the race , leaving analysts to speculate that mr tierney s 11thhour attack reflected concern in the tierney camp that mr moulton was gaining ground even if mr tierney prevails over mr moulton , his work is hardly done he will again face mr tisei , who appears eager for his own grudge match i'm gay , i'm prochoice , i have a 26year record of being someone that s very independent , and that s why i almost won last time , mr tisei said in an interview i just ran out of time the cook political report rates a matchup between mr tierney and mr tisei but what if mr moulton were the one facing mr tisei \? there s very little doubt that if seth moulton were the democrats' nominee , mr wasserman said , he would win this seat
chicago several police officers are waiting in a hotel room , handcuffs at the ready , when they get the signal a female undercover officer posing as a prostitute is with a wouldbe customer in an adjacent room , and she has pushed a secret button indicating that they should charge in to make the arrest the officers shove at the door connecting the rooms , but somehow it has become locked they ca n't get in the undercover officer is stuck with her customer tension soars curses reverberate a million fears surge then , suddenly , the door frees and the police officers rush in and arrest a graying 64yearold man , michael his smugness shatters and turns to bewilderment and shock as police officers handcuff his hands behind his back michael had reason to feel stunned police arrest women for prostitution all the time , but almost never their customers yet that is beginning to change there s a growing awareness that sex trafficking is one of the most serious human rights abuses around , estimated to be trafficked into the sex trade in the united states each year some women sell sex on their own , but coercion , beatings and recruitment of underage girls are central to the business as well just a few weeks ago , new york city police officers who had run away from home and ended up locked up by pimps and sold for sex according to court documents , she was told she would be killed if she tried to run away , but after three months she managed to call 911 police increasingly recognize that the simplest way to reduce the scale of human trafficking is to arrest men who buy sex that is n't prudishness or sanctimony but a strategy  have bought sex , and backofenvelope calculations suggest that a man has about a 1 in 100 , 000 chance of being arrested while doing so yet stings to arrest johns are marvels of efficiency here in chicago , the cook county sheriff s office places ads on prostitution websites when men call , an undercover officer directs them to a hotel room the officer negotiates a price for a sex act , and then other officers jump in and arrest the customer it s an assembly line , almost creating traffic jams in the hotel one time , a customer had just been handcuffed when the undercover officer s phone rang it was another john downstairs in the lobby just give me a few minutes to freshen up , the undercover officer purred , an expert on human trafficking at the university of rhode island , notes that police often are tougher on men who download child pornography than on johns who have sex with girls or women i think there is still the old idea around that bad woman' lure men into bad behavior , professor hughes said and the police do n't want to bring shame on the whole family by arresting the man thomas dart , , says that a basic problem is that the public does n't much sympathize with victims of trafficking he remembers his department once raiding a dogfighting operation to free pit bulls , and soon afterward raiding a sextrafficking operation to free girls and women sold for sex there was an outpouring of sympathy for the pit pulls , he said , but some carping about why the department was in the morals business and worrying about sex yet , slowly , understanding is growing that this is n't about policing morals but about protecting human rights in more and more states , , and minors are not arrested in prostitution cases but are directed to social programs sometimes that s true of adult women , too as appreciation grows that human trafficking is one of the most serious of human rights abuses , so is the recognition that a starting point in addressing it is to stop making excuses for the men who perpetuate it and start arresting them that s happening more often , although the punishments are typically minimal here in chicago , the men arrested were taken to another hotel room and made to watch a video about the risks of prostitution such as sexually transmitted diseases and then given a 500 ticket they are advised to pay the fine immediately or a registered letter will be sent to their home address there is no criminal record , and the men are released in about 30 minutes the men s cars are also towed , which costs them another 700 or so mike anton , commander of the vice unit , says that he always tells the married men that they can avoid towing fees if they call their wives to have them pick up the car none of them has ever taken me up on that , he added
sochi , russia the closing ceremony of the sochi games on sunday night was a celebration of everything russian , and everything that russia does so well a pianist filled fisht olympic stadium with rachmaninoff as dozens of grand pianos floated around the stage ballet dancers twirled and leapt so expertly that they surely could have won a gold medal for their efforts massive photos of the country s best writers chekhov , tolstoy , dostoyevsky were greeted with wild applause the entire night provided a showcase of russia s many success stories , and like it or not , hosting an olympics is now among them dmitry chernyshenko , the president of the sochi organizing committee , told me that he considered these olympics impeccable , and purely from an athletic standpoint , i have to agree as the two of us stood outside the main hockey arena , we looked out at the olympic park , which sits on the black sea , and marveled at what russia had built , turning a crumbling summer vacation spot filled with stalinera sanitariums into a compact collection of stateoftheart sporting venues in a lot of ways , these games were better than olympics past the venues , the transportation , the setting , the security all winning sure , soft snow and a few unfinished hotels upset some athletes and visitors , but most of the competitors raved i have not heard one bad thing from anyone , said the hockey player julie chu , who won a silver medal and was the flagbearer for the united states at the closing ceremony so why might there be some reluctance to acknowledge that these games were so good \? maybe because the success of them also stands as a symbol of the power and influence of president vladimir v putin putin lobbied olympic officials to give these games to sochi , which has long been his personal getaway they did , and seven years later they were confronted with the makings of a grim sporting event kept some fans and athletes' families away putin s politics turned attention before the games to human rights violations instead of athletics his disturbing record of quashing voices of dissent and his law criminalizing the spread of gay propaganda to children made the olympics difficult for many to enjoy without reservation but as the games went on , athletes were treated with respect , and none who wanted to express their opinions about politics were silenced , according to those i spoke with that s what made these games so special , said thomas bach , the international olympic committee s new president by living together under one roof in the olympic village , you send a powerful message from sochi to the world , a message of a society of peace , tolerance and respect , bach said in his closing ceremony speech , which may or may not have been scripted with putin in mind he continued , i appeal to everybody implicated in confrontation , oppression or violence act on this olympic message of dialogue and peace from his office overlooking the olympic park , bach had told me that he did his best to keep putin s politics and all politics from marring the spirit of the competitions , or the events themselves he basically said he was annoyed that he had to play referee between countries and leaders who kept trying to inject politics into these games while he did not name those world leaders , he said he did not appreciate when governments sent political messages on the backs of their athletes it was easy to guess to whom he was referring putin and president obama , who declined to attend these olympics and sent instead , presumably to make a point this is exactly what the ioc does n't need , bach told me , referring to the attempt to politicize the games i asked him why the ioc had chosen sochi to host the games , particularly when the city is in one of the most restive areas of the world he said it was because russia did not have winter sports facilities after the dissolution of the soviet union those facilities had been based outside russia and because the ioc wanted to help a great winter sports country build an infrastructure for winter sports that seemed like a feeble reason but if the goal of the olympics is to increase the participation in olympic sports , they must have succeeded this time there were other , more important benefits to having the games here more than 25 , 000 volunteers were needed to conduct these olympics many of them appeared sullen when the games began but were smiling and dancing in the olympic park by the end walking to my hotel after the closing ceremony on sunday , i saw several of them crying in celebration the ones i spoke to over the past few weeks said working for free had been a new concept for them , as it was for many people in russia similarly , if the games had not been held here , the uproar about russia s antigay law among other oppressive laws would not have been heard by so many around the world putin got the olympics , and his country thrived a less endearing side of russia was exposed in the process , which might prove to be the most important success of the games here
jonathan chait has an extended discussion and takedown of the fox news allstar panel reaction to the national climate assessment , which i won t try to summarize but i do want to delve a bit more into one point chait quotes charles krauthammer dismissing the scientific consensus because 99 percent of physicists were convinced that space and time were fixed until einstein working in a patent office wrote a paper in which he showed that they are not as chait notes , this logic would lead you to dismiss all science hey , maybe tomorrow someone will write a paper showing that the germ theory of disease is all wrong , so why bother with sterilized instruments in the hospital \? but there s something else wrong here the complete misunderstanding of what einstein did yes , einstein showed that space and time were relative concepts but did he show that everything physicists had been doing up to that point was all wrong \? of course not classical physics was an incredibly useful and successful field , and almost none of what it said had to change in light of relativity true , einstein showed that it was a special case but one that applied almost perfectly at the speeds and accelerations we encounter in normal conditions so if we had an einstein equivalent in climate science , he or she would find that existing models were right in 999 of what they assert , even though under extreme conditions they might be misleading or maybe the simpler way to put it is , dr krauthammer , you re no einstein
the yankees' infield will undergo a drastic makeover after shortstop derek jeter retires at the end of the season but even now , the four players who take the infield these days for the yankees are hardly recognizable on tuesday , the backup catcher francisco cervelli made his first career appearance as a professional at first base , in place of the injured mark teixeira brian roberts , 36 , who replaced the departed robinson cano , was at second the rookie yangervis solarte , replacing the suspended alex rodriguez , played third even jeter hardly looks like himself these days this group is prone to defensive lapses because of the players' ages or their inexperience at certain positions yankees starter ivan nova was not effective \( seven earned runs in three and twothirds innings \) in a to the baltimore orioles at yankee stadium , but he did not have much help from his infield defense , either in the first inning , after nick markakis had led off the game with a single to center field , the orioles' designated hitter , delmon young , hit a ground ball toward the shortstop side of second base after a slow couple of steps , jeter lunged but could not snag the grounder , which went into center for a single a shortstop with better range than jeter s he is rated near the bottom in most defensive metrics could have turned that grounder into a double play , or at least a forceout after a sacrifice fly drove in markakis , adam jones hit a tworun homer he dove , manager joe girardi said of jeter , who was not in the clubhouse after the game i mean , he did everything he could to make the play it seemed to get through the infield fairly quickly but he did everything he could a diplomatic nova said that it was impossible to assume what would happen once a ball was put into play of course you want to get the double play , but it did n't work out that way , he said with the yankees trailing by 31 in the second , orioles second baseman ryan flaherty hit a bunt toward first base that slipped past nova and was fielded by cervelli , who could not make a play in time the next batter , jonathan schoop , lined a ball that solarte was unable to catch , and it went down the line for a runscoring double none of the plays was ruled an error , and none was routine , but they were all plays that could have been made the yankees rely heavily on positioning to compensate for their infield , which is by turns slowmoving and inexperienced they have their infielders shift sharply toward a particular side if their advance reports say a player hits the ball to that area for example , the yankees had solarte move to the right side when the lefthanded baltimore slugger chris davis who hit 53 home runs last season was up to bat but they will use a shift for any player , not just power hitters on monday , the yankees employed a similar rightside shift for the lighthitting flaherty , who had a 683 onbase plus slugging percentage last year they will position jeter toward second base with a lefthanded player at the plate , or they will have him move toward third base for a righthanded batter but the one thing they cannot do for jeter is turn back the clock to make him quicker on balls hit away from him shifts can do only so much i think they 're extremely important , girardi said of the defensive shifting and positioning there s obviously a lot of thought and data that goes into it we look at histories and our pitchers and what type of pitches they have we try to put them in the best play possible sometimes , they do n't always go there , but we 're playing the law of averages you 're going to see it work a lot more than not work but every once in a while , it s not going to go the way we want nova was as much to blame for the poor day as the infield was the seven earned runs were the most he had allowed since aug 6 , 2012 even after nova s poor start , the yankees trailed by just three runs through five innings but young s tworun homer off reliever vidal nuno began the orioles' fourrun sixth , putting the game out of reach after the game , nova seemed dejected at the realization that he had been unable to carry his solid spring \( a 366 earned run average \) into the season yankees catcher brian mccann said nova simply could not get into a groove throwing his fastball down in the zone , making his curveball less effective on top of his bad outing , nova said he felt responsible for the missed play on flaherty s bunt in the second inning cervelli said he had not wanted to risk a throw to first because nobody was in position to catch the ball it was my fault , nova said i should have made that play i should have run to the base or run straight at the ball in the end , nova s infield play was no better than his teammates'
at a dinner party the other night where people were asked to say a word about themselves , one woman said , my name is whatever it was and i'm a foodie i cringed i'm not proud of that visceral reaction in fact , i think it s wrong but i do wish there were a stronger , less demeaningsounding word than foodie for someone who cares about good food , but as seems so often the case , there is not witness the nearmeaninglessness of natural and vegetarian and the inadequacy of organic and vegan but proposing new words is a fool s game rather , let s try to make the word foodie a tad more meaningful as it stands , many selfdescribed foodies are newstyle epicures and there s nothing destructive about watching competitive cooking shows , doing anything to get a table at the trendy restaurant , scouring the web for singleestate farro , or devoting oneself to finding the best food truck the problem arises when it stops there more conscious foodies understand that producing food has an effect beyond creating an opportunity for pleasure and this woman was not atypical she s into sustainability \( we have to grow our food better , right \? \) , organic \( though for all i know this means organic junk food \) and local food she shops at farmers' markets when she can she cooks we ca n't ask everyone who likes eating which , given enough time and an adequate income , includes everyone i 've ever met to become a food activist but to increase the consciousness levels of wellintentioned foodies , it might be useful to sketch out what caring about good food means , and to try to move foodie to a place where it refers to someone who gets beyond fun to pay attention to how food is produced and the impact it has the qualities that characterize good food vary within a narrow range good food is real , it s healthy , it s produced sustainably , it s fair and it s affordable maybe it s prepared at home , though if communal kitchens or restaurants can deliver those qualities , i'm all for that none of this is complicated , but simple does n't mean easy real means traditional if it existed 100 years ago , it s probably real hyperprocessed is neither real nor healthy no single factor is causing our dietrelated health crisis , but some things we eat are making us sick and it s more likely that the culprits are added sugars , not asparagus so , healthy most likely will always be whole or even real this does n't mean we should eat more watercress because it s a superfood , high in some supposedly critical nutrient , but it does mean we want to eat more fruits and vegetables as we know sustainable \( or green , another word that s been rendered nearmeaningless \) suggests resourceneutral , or as close to it as we can come there is farming , not necessarily organic , that puts as much back into the soil as it extracts it also uses water in a way that will guarantee a supply for the future we can call that sustainable fair and affordable are very tough as margaret gray discusses in her excellent book , labor and the locavore , we cannot achieve ethical consistency in producing food without paying attention to labor \( animals are important too , but i suppose i'm an anthrochauvinist \) for food to be affordable , people all people must earn living wages alternatively , good food must be subsidized both conditions would be even better \( as almost every foodie knows , we 're currently subsidizing bad food \) some of these qualities can be controlled by individuals most of us can eat real and healthier food easily enough , and , as it happens , growing such food tends to be more sustainable on a grand scale , we need societal changes and government support to make this more accessible to everyone but and this is the part i like best making good food fair and affordable cannot be achieved without affecting the whole system these are not just food questions they are questions of justice and equality and rights , of enhancing rather than restricting democracy , of making a more rational , legitimate economy in other words , working to make food fair and affordable is an opportunity for this country to live up to its founding principles so shifting the implications of foodie means shifting our culture to one in which eaters that s everyone realize that buying into the current food system means exploiting animals , people and the environment , and making ourselves sick to change that , we have to change not only the way we behave as individuals but the way we behave as a society it s rewarding to find the best pork bun it s even more rewarding to fight for a good food system at the same time that s what we foodies do
amman , jordan ended an eightyear moratorium on executions on sunday when 11 men were hanged at dawn the men had been convicted of murder charges from 2002 to 2004 , according to a statement released by the interior ministry the government carried out the executions at the swaqa corrections and rehabilitation center , 60 miles south of amman , the capital , after taking all required legal measures , according to the ministry s spokesman , ziad zubi s last previous execution , in march 2006 , was carried out for a man convicted of killing his wife and baby last month , the interior minister , hussein majali , that a committee had been formed to examine whether to reinstate the death penalty mr majali said members of the public believed that a rise in crime was related to the absence of executions the number of felonies and other crimes in the country increased to 33 , 800 last year from 24 , 700 in 2009 , according to jordan s department of statistics , but the kingdom is generally seen as one of the safest in the region since 2006 , more than 100 people have been sentenced to death for crimes like murder , rape and treason , but until sunday , none of the sentences had been carried out jordanian and international human rights organizations heavily criticized the government on sunday reinstatement of the death penalty is a major blow to jordan s official rhetoric in support of human rights , said adam coogle , a middle east researcher at human rights watch the government should immediately reverse course and instead take prompt and decisive action toward a total abolition of this inherently cruel punishment in a released on sunday by human rights watch , sarah leah whitson , the director of the middle east program , said , reviving this inherently cruel form of punishment is another way jordan is backsliding on human rights the european union has been pushing jordan to make the moratorium permanent the swedish ambassador to jordan , helena rietz , expressed her concern over the executions on the european union and sweden urged jordan to abolish the death penalty in a news release on sunday , the british ambassador to jordan , peter millett , also expressed his regret over the executions we urge jordan to put in place a moratorium on any further use of the death penalty , mr millett said we consider that its use undermines human dignity , that there is no conclusive evidence that it has any value as a deterrent in jordan , no death sentence may be carried out unless the king approves it i met with the family of a son who was murdered in cold blood more than a year ago , said adeeb akroosh , 67 , a jordanian activist there were many jordanians there who wrote a letter to his majesty asking him to reinstate the death penalty by sunday afternoon , the names of the 11 men were published in the jordanian news media on thursday , a record number of countries threw their weight behind a united nations general assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions 117 of the 193 member states voted in favor of the resolution , 38 voted against it , and 34 abstained
dublin the government and the police are coming under increasing pressure to open an investigation into allegations that a roman catholic religious order secretly buried up to 796 babies and toddlers born to unmarried mothers in a septic tank over several decades speaking in the irish parliament on wednesday , the minister for children and youth affairs , charlie flanagan , called the discovery of what is described as an unmarked grave as deeply disturbing and a shocking reminder of a darker past in ireland when our children were not cherished as they should have been the burials are believed to have taken place on the site of a socalled motherandbaby home in tuam , county galway , from 1925 to 1961 the institution , which was run by the sisters of bon secours , was subsequently demolished , and a housing development now sits adjacent to the site the sisters have declined to comment they were reported to be meeting with the local bishop they have neither denied nor confirmed the practice suspicions first arose as long ago as 1975 when two 12yearold boys , francis hopkins and barry sweeney , peered into a hole in a concrete slab while they were playing according to their accounts , it was filled to the brim with bones however , most local people had apparently believed that the remains dated from a workhouse that had been on the site before the motherandbaby home , or perhaps even as far back as the famine of the 1840s the allegations of a more recent origin are based on research by a local historian , catherine corless , who discovered from state records that up to 796 children had died at the home from a range of ailments including malnutrition , measles , tuberculosis , gastroenteritis and pneumonia when she crossreferenced the names with those in local graveyards , she found none had been buried in any of those cemeteries based on mapping of the former home and strong anecdotal evidence , she concluded that the only possible resting place for the corpses had to be the site specified by the two boys almost four decades ago the site is situated at the edge of the grounds of the former home the police , called the garda , said in a statement on wednesday that there were no grounds for starting an investigation these are historical burials going back to famine times , the statement said there is no suggestion of any impropriety and there is no garda investigation also , there is no confirmation from any source that there are between 750 and 800 bodies present politicians across the political spectrum are demanding an investigation speaking on national radio , colm keaveney , who represents the tuam area , called on prime minister enda kenny to offer a full , formal apology on behalf of the state for the appalling treatment of mothers and babies during that period there were homes for fallen women , and unmarried mothers were stigmatized after giving birth , young mothers whose families were not wealthy enough to buy them out had to work in laundries or do other menial labor for years after the baby was given away for adoption , in some cases illegally trafficked to the united states the archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , told that he would support the excavation of unmarked graves where there are reasonable grounds and the setting up of monuments at any unmarked grave sites there is mounting pressure not only to start an investigation into tuam but also to extend it to the other former sites operated by the order throughout ireland the homes have come to international attention in recent years largely because of the movie which told the story of one woman s search for the son who was taken from her
if there was ever a symbol of the growing disparity between the costs of great instruments and the wages of the musicians who know how to play them , it is the astronomical that sellers are seeking this spring for a rare stradivari viola even fine modern instruments , whose prices have not been inflated by avid collectors who see them as investments , can cost tens of thousands of dollars , putting them out of the reach of young players saddled with conservatory debt many musicians rely on institutions or benefactors to lend them instruments as underscored earlier this year by the sensational and recovery of the lipinski strad , a 1715 violin played by frank almond , the concertmaster of the milwaukee symphony orchestra , but owned by an anonymous patron but the relationships between artists and even the most generous patrons can be awkward , fueling a musician s sense of indebtedness to benefactors , or a reluctance to leave an unsatisfying post because it allows access to great instruments the violinist helena baillie , who is playing at on sunday , is the beneficiary of an unusual new lending model intended to insulate musicians from patrons and institutions alike that she hopes can be replicated by others it works this way her longtime benefactor , s b lewis , donated more than 200 , 000 to bard college where ms baillie is an artistic for the school to buy two modern violins and a viola , and several bows , for her lifetime use she can keep playing them even if she leaves bard , and can later either buy them from the college or leave them to the college mr lewis said he came up with the model to relieve artists of the fear of being severed from their cherished instruments , and to end what he sees as their potentially unhealthy reliance on individual benefactors or institutions for access to the tools of their trade this way , they 're not going to bail out on you , they 're not going to tell you one day , i'm tired of listening to you , ' or you did n't show up at my kid s bar mitzvah' none of this , said in an interview i just want to figure out a way to free the artist , get them started and create a paradigm shift in the way that these instruments are traded leon botstein , the of bard , and the of the american symphony orchestra , used a musical term to describe how the setup differed from more traditional instrument loans it is a variation , a nice variation , and i would encourage institutions to do it , he said , noting that it served the needs of the artist , the benefactor and the college , which will eventually get the instruments , or money for them that can be used for other purposes ms baillie , who holds a kind of artistinresidence post at bard , said that she was delighted to have lifetime use of the instruments , two of which were made by the distinguished modern luthier sam zygmuntowicz , and one by collin gallahue she will play them at bargemusic during a program of stravinsky , tartini , vivaldi , and shostakovich it represents , in a way , a new ecosystem for patrons and artists , where the beneficiary is empowered rather than beholden , she said and that gives a level of emotional serenity that s so rare , where artists depend on support to be able to play these great instruments there is debate among musicians about whether ancient instruments by stradivari or guarneri del ges , which can cost millions of dollars , really sound better than the best modern instruments ms baillie , who used to play a strad , said she had become a convert to the school that favors the modern but those who prefer older instruments whose prices have skyrocketed far faster than the rate of inflation as dealers , collectors and investors have driven up their prices fear that they are getting ever further out of reach of the players who know how to use them jim vanvalkenburg , the at the detroit symphony orchestra , said he was worried that the current generation cannot afford instruments as good as those that older generations could he recalled how in 1983 , as a young player in a string quartet at brown university , he took out a large loan borrowing more than he could earn in two years to buy a fine viola , and how he struggled to make the high monthly payments for years now , he said , many instruments are so expensive that young players cannot hope to get loans big enough to pay for them mr vanvalkenburg said that orchestras , philanthropists and others need to figure out ways to address the imbalance it s a very different world that we inhabit now , he said , and we need to react or we 're going to be left behind mr botstein , who lends his own violin to young players , said that the imbalance between supply and demand and the entry of investors and collectors into the instrument market had driven up prices who 'd want to own a violin \? he asked in principle , no one except someone who would use it except for those who are collectors and not all collectors are clever enough to realize that a violin needs to be used mr lewis an outspoken former wall street titan who pleaded guilty to stock manipulation in 1989 , was pardoned by president bill clinton and now has a farm in the adirondacks said that while his donation paid for comparatively inexpensive modern instruments , a similar model could be used to give older , more expensive ones ms baillie said she was grateful to mr lewis , who has helped and guided her for years , for figuring out a way for her to be in control of the instruments she plays i'm incredibly lucky , she said i found an ideal violin
philadelphia a string of indistinct injuries has recently hit the mets' pitching staff , giving the team and fans a sense of nervousness every time a pitcher shows the slightest pain on july 4 , jon niese was struck in the back by a line drive after throwing only 12 pitches he was removed from the game and two days later was placed on the disabled list with a left shoulder strain on sunday , the mets unexpectedly announced that jacob degrom would visit doctors in new york on monday after he felt soreness in his shoulder in the days after his last start hours after the announcement , closer jenrry mejia revealed he had been pitching with a hernia for the past three weeks so far , none of the injuries appear to have devastated the roster , as the mets try to protect the valuable arms that will be their nexus for this season and beyond on monday , niese pitched his best game since late june in a 53 victory over the philadelphia phillies and though degrom was placed on the 15day disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis after a magnetic resonance imaging test , john ricco , the assistant general manager , said he was optimistic that degrom would not need more time to recover the stint on the dl may actually come at an opportune time for the mets as a rookie pitcher on an innings limit , degrom was due for a break so the team could stretch him out over the remainder of the season the mets also have an abundance of viable fillins , including rafael montero , who was called up from class aaa las vegas to replace degrom and start tuesday s game i'm very relieved , manager terry collins said actually , that s about as good as you can hope for that was all it was going to be collins added that degrom s respite would allow him to get some strength back in his arm and be ready for the last month niese , who also has a history of shoulder ailments , took an important step monday toward regaining his dominant firsthalf form since returning from the disabled list on july 21 , niese had been 04 with a 576 earned run average he picked up his sixth victory of the season but walked three and hit a batter before being placed on the disabled list on july 6 , niese was 54 with a 296 era and had allowed only 28 walks in 17 starts base on balls have hurt him , and they did again today , but i thought he pitched a good game today and got us through seven , which we needed , collins said with the mets trailing , 21 , niese was backed by four runs in the seventh inning , three on a homer by anthony recker david buchanan , 25 , who was a nonroster invitee to phillies spring training , limited the mets to one run through his first six innings originally an unsigned sixthround pick by the mets in the 2009 draft , buchanan was replaced after walking juan lagares and allowing a runscoring double to matt den dekker in the seventh niese retired the first two batters in the seventh inning before domonic brown lined a double to right field ben revere followed with a single to center field , but lagares cut brown down at the plate with a precise throw to recker for the third out and his fourth outfield assist this season niese finished the day striking out six batters on 107 pitches , his highest count since may 5 i was running on fumes there i was pretty tired , niese said juan made that unbelievable play , and i got through it because mejia pitched in three of the past four games , jeurys familia was called upon to collect a fourout save chase utley hit a twoout pinch hit groundrule double to score cody asche , who had walked originally , utley s hit was ruled a home run , but the play was challenged , and reviews showed a fan reaching over the rightfield railing with a hat to impede the ball s flight familia later induced a flyout for his second save in three days collins said mejia would be ready for tuesday s game but he told mejia , his valued young closer , that he needed to speak up if the hernia began to affect his pitching it s so important for these young guys to know what it takes to get through september , collins said if you 're going to win , if you 're going to be a championship team , you 've got to know what it s like to play in the last month of the season inside pitch jeremy hefner visited with doctors on monday in new york and it was revealed that he reinjured a ligament in his right elbow and has a stress fracture in his right ulna john ricco said that surgery was a possibility hefner , who has been rehabilitating an elbow injury at the mets training facility in port st lucie , fla , had tommy john surgery in august 2013
much of this year s election has been defined by republicans trying to scare people into voting their fears , but democrats are also capable of frightening voters to the polls their most visible attempt arrived in mailboxes in new york and elsewhere over the last few weeks in the form of a report card grading voters on their participation in past elections the card , sent by state democratic parties , showed how many times people had voted in the last four general elections in the new york mailing , three or four times was considered excellent , two was good , one was fair , and none was given an incomplete not enough data at present time , voting record to be reassessed postnovember election then the language of the mailing turned a little bit intimidating we re sending this mailing to you and your neighbors to publicize who does and does not vote , said the card sent out by the connecticut party we will be reviewing these records after the election to determine whether or not you have joined your neighbors in voting the missouri card said a follow up report may be issued following the november 4th elections to publicize who does and does not encourage election participation and in north carolina , the tone was reminiscent of an authoritarian caricature if you do not vote this year , we will be interested to hear why not there s a theory behind these cards research has shown that one of the most effective ways to get people to vote particularly in lowturnout midterms is to apply social pressure , to give a person the sense that others are voting and that they are expected to join in democrats say these cards actually work , and given the widespread republican effort to suppress the vote , they are trying to use every tool at their disposal to increase it this flyer is part of the nationwide democratic response to traditional republican voter suppression efforts , said peter kauffmann , a spokesman for the new york state democratic committee , in an interview democrats believe our democracy works better when more people vote , not less the problem is the tone , not the tactic many people don t realize that their participation in an election is a matter of public record , unlike their actual vote apathy and laziness are the worst enemies of a vigorous public life , and there s nothing wrong with reminding people of their civic responsibility through a straightforward report card but when the language turns threatening and creepy we will be interested to hear why not it can backfire , and has already produced many complaints if democrats had simply said , you ve got a great voting record , now keep it going , or you haven t voted in years , but we really need you now it would have served the function of a reminder without the threat the democrats , too often maligned as the party of big government , should be more careful not to draw comparisons to big brother
houston at the pregnancy tank at the harris county jail , asking a female inmate how much longer do you have \? can get a puzzled look in response she could answer with a due date or an anticipated date of discharge from jail the tank is a twostory , atriumlike room with private cells it houses 30 inmates chosen for a mentoring moms program , a 60 to 90day course for inmates who are either pregnant or have young children through partnerships with 30 nonprofit groups and businesses , the program teaches participants about the help available on the outside that will keep them from returning to jail i 've learned coping skills how to deal with my anger , how to deal with many things , an inmate in the program , laura dominguez , 21 , said pregnant with her second child , ms dominguez is serving a sentence for driving while intoxicated and expects to be released a month before her daughter is born i do n't want to be back , she said my kids need me , and jail really is n't a place to be courses in the program , which began nov 1 , teach inmates how to find jobs , beat addiction and be better parents i want to see a show of hands that you 're going to parent different than you were before you got here , a certified recovery coach , raunda lindsey , said during a recent lesson focused on alternative child disciplinary methods you take a breath before you raise your hand or your voice similar programs for mothers who have served jail sentences begin upon their release jennifer herring , who manages the division of the harris county sheriff s department that helps inmates transition back into the community , said the program is one of a kind what we have done that s revolutionary here is to bring the actual program inside the jail , which is transformative in itself because the client is most vulnerable at this point , she said officials at the harris county jail , the nation s thirdlargest , estimated that it housed 100 pregnant inmates on a given day most of those are not in jail long enough to enroll in the program , ms herring said many women often learn they are pregnant only after a medical assessment more than two weeks after their arrival students at the university of houston are tracking the women s progress after their release thirty students a semester measure the program s effectiveness to date , 68 women have taken part of those , 21 have been discharged none have returned \( the university of houston is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune \) the community partners send staff members weekly to educate the inmates on turning their lives around they have the funding they have the services we have the client we connect them , ms herring said , one of three paid staff members who oversee mentoring moms , the jail s program and a forthcoming veterans support initiative the inmates themselves help pay the staffers' salaries through the money they spend at the commissary mentoring moms is also focused on supporting women who are up to three years postpartum melyssa olsen , 23 , who miscarried days after entering the program , says that after spending most of her adult life behind bars , she has not always been there for her 9yearold son i 've never had a chance to raise my son , ms olsen said so i have to learn this program is teaching me the participants are as varied as their rap sheets , but they all have a desire to want to be with their babies , ms herring said so what we do is create a creative , comprehensive holistic program so somewhere in that process they find themselves
paris , the first french president to pay a state visit to the united states since 1996 , is seemingly a man of paradox before the 2012 elections , he was taunted by political rivals as flanby \( a custardlike dessert \) or capitaine de p dalo \( paddle boat captain \) hardly epithets befitting a wouldbe commander in chief yet , within his first 20 months in office , the socialist party s successor to president nicolas sarkozy has ordered his country s troops into two african conflicts , in mali and the central african republic , and came within hours of unleashing cruise missiles against syria there is a certain irony , then , that this avowedly interventionist french president is meeting an american president who has been chiefly preoccupied with the task of disengaging his country from two wearying and costly military entanglements how to reconcile the tension between their contrasting priorities will be high on the agenda this week for president barack obama and mr hollande it might be tempting to ascribe mr hollande s military decision making to political expediency , but this would be a serious misreading of why goes to war presidents jacques chirac and sarkozy were not shy of foreign intervention \( in bosnia and kosovo , and in afghanistan and libya , respectively \) neither were their predecessors , fran ois mitterrand \( in lebanon and chad \) and val ry giscard d'estaing \( dubbed l'africain for his propensity for military action in africa \) the outlier in this pattern was france s refusal to participate in president george w bush s misadventure in iraq while this may have imprinted on the american psyche a tabloid press impression of french membership in an axis of weasel , france s robust opposition to the iraq war has actually reinforced the french public s trust in the executive s judgment on matters of war and peace in sharp contrast to popular attitudes in america and britain , as we saw last august during the diplomatic crisis over syria none of this means that the french have turned into latterday prussians before mr sarkozy intervened in libya , barely onethird of the population supported military action but once the campaign had begun , support jumped to 66 percent experienced politicians also know that even successful wars do n't win elections even after the good outcome of the operation he ordered against islamist insurgents in mali , mr hollande remarked pointedly that military intervention was n't what the voters had chosen him for yet the performance of french forces in libya and mali has certainly bolstered the nation s military selfconfidence france s sense of having been vindicated in resisting american pressure over iraq has also had the counterintuitive effect of making it easier now for the french to work with the united states in places and at times of their choosing after the chemical weapons attacks in syria last summer , the french even found themselves leading the charge for a military response , beyond what mr obama was willing to countenance in the absence of congressional approval differences emerged anew on nov 10 , when france initially blocked a nuclear deal with iran the white house invitation to mr hollande , issued on nov 22 , could be seen as recognition that america needed to work harder to keep its ally close but mr obama should expect the french to continue to press for a tough stance in dealing with the iranian  conversely , france worries deeply as do other european and middle eastern allies about america s foreign policy shift after iraq and afghanistan , its reluctance to put american forces in the front line in the world s trouble spots france also fears the longterm consequences of the obama administration s pivot to asia these concerns will certainly color mr hollande s visit , albeit in a constructive spirit rather than with traditional gallic petulance we can expect mr hollande to stress the importance of maintaining close frenchamerican military cooperation , whether in a region where the french are leading , like counterterrorism operations in the sahara , or where the united states is the prime mover , like the indian ocean on another front , france and britain are building joint facilities to simulate nuclear tests in order to ensure the longterm effectiveness of their atomic stockpiles this and the fact that paris and london have cultivated a close military relationship help mr obama the white house is not being asked to referee a beauty contest between france and britain with no immediate largescale crisis to contend with , and in the absence of major disagreements , each president should get what he wants from this visit for mr obama , that will be a demonstration that the united states is not

naypyidaw , myanmar is in the midst of changes unparalleled in our history expectations are high , but the needs of our people are even greater we must succeed in our transition to peace , democracy and inclusive economic development and for this to happen we need the rest of the world to appreciate the complexity of the challenges that the burmese government faces we live in the shadow of our past a past shaped by colonial occupation and military dictatorships , and by our unique geography between asia s giant civilizations of india and china , a geography that must be carefully managed we suffer from extremely limited institutional capacity and even more from the mindsets and mentalities that emerged under isolation and authoritarian rule these are things that cannot change overnight one of our most important tasks at the moment is bringing about a just and sustainable end to 70 years of armed conflict one of the longestrunning internal conflicts in the world we are committed to a federal union formed under the principles of democracy , equality and selfdetermination we have been in talks with nearly two dozen different ethnicbased armed groups with the goal of a nationwide ceasefire agreement we want an end to fighting that will allow displaced people to return home and resume their livelihoods we wish to open space for dialogue at all levels including political talks at the highest levels aimed at a final peace accord these talks may well lead to constitutional reforms , including in the area of civilmilitary relations we are also determined to end the humanitarian crisis in our western rakhine state , a site of recent communal violence we will very soon release a final action plan to address the totality of issues in rakhine state , one that conforms to accepted international standards in all respects , including on issues of humanitarian access , resettlement , livelihoods and citizenship we are committed to heightened security to prevent any further violence and will take the toughest measures under the law to prosecute those responsible for violence or incitement to violence there will be no forced resettlement of people all people in myanmar , regardless of ethnicity or religion , deserve the same fundamental rights and freedoms in a year s time we will hold general elections we are committed to an electoral process that is totally free and fair , and are working hard to ensure the elections will be a major step forward in building our democracy we are in constant dialogue with political parties and hundreds of civil society organizations we will not only allow domestic monitors but international election observers as well we hope for elections that are not only free but that encourage substantive debates of policies , offering people real choices for the future we are committed as well to a free media the newly established myanmar press council is working hard to make this a reality and we understand fully the importance of a free , independent , and responsible media as a key component to any democratic society alongside all these political efforts , we are working as hard as possible on developing our economy reducing poverty is a task that can be second to none this requires many different reforms from currency reform to the creation of a central bank to establishing a more liberal trade and investment system than previously existed it is essential that we expand our economy in an inclusive way and in a way that protects our natural environment at the same time as we embark on our political changes we are encouraged and heartened by the support given by governments and international institutions america both the united states government and american friends and organizations has played a critical role in moving us away from decades of dictatorship to a place where we can now at least see the light at the end of the tunnel who arrived in our country on wednesday and leaves for australia on friday and secretaries of state hillary rodham clinton and john kerry have all been important , but so too have senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle in congress our interest is not in aid funding for our reforms what we want more than anything is that friends of myanmar around the world understand the nuances of what is happening and be aware of the big picture that we are a small nation between giant neighbors , poor and isolated for decades , with entrenched systems and views that have grown up over generations , now trying decisively to move toward peace and democracy it is a grand experiment , but we are determined to succeed
nothing makes scientists happier than an experimental result that completely contradicts a widely accepted theory the scientists who first invented the theory might not be tickled , but their colleagues will be overjoyed science progresses when a good theory is superseded by an even better theory , and the most direct route to building a better theory is to be confronted by data that simply don t fit the old one nature is not always so kind , however fields like particle physics and cosmology sometimes include good theories that fit all the data but nevertheless seem unsatisfying to us the hot big bang model , for example , which posits that the early universe was hot , dense , and rapidly expanding , is an excellent fit to cosmological data but it starts by assuming that the distribution of matter began in an incredibly smooth configuration , distributed nearly homogeneously through space that state of affairs appears to be extremely unnatural of all the ways matter could have been distributed , the overwhelming majority are wildly lumpy , with dramatically different densities from place to place the initial conditions of the universe seem uncanny , or finely tuned , not at all as if they were set at random good scientific theories can fit all the data but still seem unsatisfying to us faced with theories that fit all the data but seem unnatural , one can certainly shrug and say , maybe that s just the way it is but most physicists take the attitude that almost none of our current models are exactly correct our best ideas are still approximations to the underlying reality in that case , apparent finetunings can be taken as potential clues that might prod us into building better theories last week s announcement of the observation of gravitational waves from the earliest moments of the history of the universe will if the observation holds up represent a resounding victory for this kind of approach the observations seem to verify a prediction of the theory of cosmic inflation , proposed by the physicist alan guth in 1980 \( with both important predecessors and subsequent elaborations \) guth was primarily motivated by a desire to provide a more natural explanation of why our universe looks the way it does guth s proposal was that the extremely early universe was dominated for a time by a mysterious form of energy that made it expand at a superaccelerated rate , before that energy later converted into ordinary particles of matter and radiation we don t know exactly what the source of that energy was , but physicists have a number of plausible candidates in the meantime we simply call it the inflaton unlike matter , which tends to clump together under the force of gravity , the inflaton works to stretch out space and make the distribution of energy increasingly smooth by the time the energy in the inflaton converts into regular particles , we are left with a hot , dense , smooth early universe exactly what is needed to get the big bang model off the ground if inflation occurred , the smoothness of the early universe is the most natural thing in the world inflation has become a starting point for much contemporary theorizing about the beginning of the universe cosmologists either work to elaborate the details of the model , or struggle to find a viable alternative which is why excitement was so high last week when cosmologists announced that they had found the imprint of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background , the leftover radiation from the big bang these gravitational waves are a direct prediction of inflation before last week , our reliable knowledge of the universe stretched back to about one second after the big bang this observation pushes our reach back to one trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second the theory of cosmic inflation was motivated by the simple desire to have a more natural explanation of the early universe cosmic inflation is an extraordinary extrapolation and it was motivated not by any direct contradiction between theory and experiment , but by the simple desire to have a more natural explanation for the conditions of the early universe if these observations favoring inflation hold up a big if , of course it will represent an enormous triumph for reasoning based on the search for naturalness in physical explanations the triumph , unfortunately , is not a completely clean one if inflation occurs , the conditions we observe in the early universe are completely natural but is the occurrence of inflation itself completely natural \? that depends the original hope was that inflation would naturally arise as the early universe expanded and cooled , or perhaps that it would simply start somewhere \( even if not everywhere \) as a result of chaotically fluctuating initial conditions but closer examination reveals that inflation itself requires a very specific starting point conditions that , one must say , appear to be quite delicately tuned and unnatural from this perspective , inflation by itself doesn t fully explain the early universe it simply changes the kind of explanation we are seeking fortunately maybe there is a complication soon after guth proposed inflation , the physicists alexander vilenkin and andrei linde pointed out that the process of inflation can go on forever instead of the inflaton energy converting into ordinary particles all throughout the universe , it can convert in some places but not others , creating localized big bangs elsewhere inflation continues , eventually producing other separate universes , eventually an infinite number from an attempt to explain conditions in the single universe that we see , cosmologists end up predicting a multiverse this may sound like a very peculiar result but in the news conference after last week s announcement , both guth and linde suggested that evidence for inflation boosts the case for the multiverse and perhaps the multiverse repays the favor the fundamental laws of physics obey the principles of quantum mechanics rather than predicting definite outcomes , we attach probabilities to members of an ensemble of many different experimental outcomes if inflation begins in any part of this quantum ensemble , and that inflation goes on forever , it creates an infinite number of individual universes so even if inflation itself seems unlikely , multiplying by the infinite number of universes it creates makes it quite plausible that we find ourselves in a postinflationary situation if you find the logic of the previous paragraph less than perfectly convincing , you are not alone not that it is obviously wrong but it s not obviously right , either the multiverse idea represents a significant shift in the philosophy underlying inflation rather than explaining why we live precisely in this kind of universe , eternal inflation admits there are many kinds of local universes , and expresses the hope that ones like ours are more likely than other kinds perhaps they are at this point , however , we simply don t know how to do the math the multiverse is a provocative scenario , but the specific models that predict it are very tentative , far from the pristine rigor one expects of a mature physical theory how many universes are there \? how do we decide which sets of conditions are most likely within the giant ensemble of possibilities \? how do we balance the intrinsic probabilities of quantum mechanics with the possible infinite proliferation of local regions \? does absolutely everything happen within the multiverse , or are only some possibilities actually realized \? the questions are daunting , but they re not necessarily hopeless physical theories are often vague when first proposed , and only come into focus after a great deal of effort inflation was originally motivated by a quest for naturalness , and its audacious extrapolations away from established physics have apparently been vindicated by new observations the multiverse , in its modern cosmological guise , has a similar origin it s not that a group of theoretical physicists were unwinding with some adult beverages and starting wondering out loud , what if there were billions and billions of universes \? it s that the equations we invented to explain observational data \( the smoothness of our initial conditions \) ended up pointing in the direction of this provocative possibility , and it s the responsibility of scientists to take the predictions of their models as seriously as possible naturalness is a subtle criterion in the case of inflationary cosmology , the drive to find a natural theory seems to have paid off handsomely , but perhaps other seemingly unnatural features of our world must simply be accepted ultimately it s nature , not us , that decides what s natural sean carroll , a theoretical physicist at the california institute of technology , is the author of the particle at the end of the universe how the hunt for the higgs boson leads us to the edge of a new world
president obama will on the growing threat of isis a lot of people will be watching to see first whether he now has a strategy in syria , which he famously said he did n't have not long ago , says peter baker , our white house correspondent the question is , what that strategy is , will it work , how long will it take and what will it mean for a country that s been at war for 13 years straight now mr baker says he expects the president to say again that he has ruled out ground troops , even if he does authorize airstrikes inside syria instead , he 'll emphasize that this requires a variety of elements , mr baker says , including syrian rebel forces on the ground , an international coalition to help cut off support for isis and political reconciliation in iraq and a larger resolution to syria s civil war every major product apple announced has been done by someone else already , says nick wingfield , one of our technology reporters it has a gift , though , for making them better he s commenting on of bigscreen iphones , a heralded mobile payment system and a smartwatch to track activity and stay connected bigscreen phones that are wannabe tablets have already been huge mainstream hits for samsung , he says a lot of apple fans are going to be thrilled that the company finally came around to making bigger phones apple s greater challenge will be selling the public on the need for a smartwatch and mobile payments , both products that others have tried with mixed results apple is great at making old technologies easier to use and conjuring up a need for things where none was apparent before , mr wingfield says the company s european market share is close to 90 percent \( excluding russia \) , compared with just twothirds in the united states , says danny hakim , one of our correspondents in london but as , it s also clear just how much anger and resentment google faces , he says first , he says , are the revelations by edward snowden about the role technology plays in america s intelligencegathering practices then there are worries about whether american tech giants pay their fair share of european taxes and in policy circles there is concern about the competitiveness of european technology companies , and whether they are being improperly squeezed by the big silicon valley companies , mr hakim says and it s important to remember that anger against them is being stoked , too , by some of their american rivals , principally microsoft , he notes one of our explored how qatar s support of political islam has angered the other oilrich persian gulf monarchies only qatar s royal family knows for sure why it has courted the muslim brotherhood and similar groups , says the article s author , david d kirkpatrick , our cairo bureau chief but regional politics offer one answer , he tells us islamists who have dealings with qatar say the emirate cultivates mainstream islamist parties around the region as a counterweight to saudi arabia , he says qatar already has a close military partnership with the united states , he adds , so it has hedged its bets over the last 45 years , one might argue , political islam has steadily moved closer to power across the arab world , mr kirkpatrick says , so betting on its future is not unreasonable this is our life what do n't you get if your intentions were to hurt us , embarrass us , make us feel alone , take all happiness away , you 've succeeded on so many levels that s janay rice on her instagram account today , rebuking the press and the public for interfering after a video emerged monday of her being knocked out cold in atlantic city in february she married the man who did it , ray rice but the public was less forgiving , and now the baltimore ravens have dropped him and the nfl has suspended him indefinitely james mckinley , our courts reporter , characterized her argument as why is the howl from the internet mob causing the league to take away my husband s livelihood when i have forgiven him \?

moscow hours after being spared prison on tuesday in a criminal fraud trial widely viewed as political revenge , the kremlin s chief antagonist , aleksei a navalny , broke out of house arrest and tried to join an unsanctioned antigovernment rally , daring the authorities to throw him in jail they refrained , but in a twist that clearly caught mr navalny , the normally unruffled political opposition leader off guard , the court ordered that his younger brother , oleg , who was also charged in the fraud case , serve three and half years in prison the jailing of the brother , a former postal worker generally viewed as a pawn in a larger battle , signaled that the kremlin was adopting a heavyhanded strategy in seeking to suppress mr navalny s political activities by sidelining him without transforming him into a martyr are n't you ashamed \? mr navalny cried out in dismay at the young judge , yelena korobchenko , as she read the verdict why are you jailing him \? mr navalny shouted , with tears in his eyes this is a dirty trick to punish me more \? some analysts said that was precisely the goal kremlin liberalism , lilia shevtsova , an expert on russian domestic politics at the brookings institution , wrote in a post on facebook let s put him on a long leash we can always shorten it and the brother gets a real sentence this means that we take a family member hostage ! and we can make his life in prison unbearable a trenchant critic of s rampant corruption , mr navalny became a hero to the tens of thousands of muscovites who took to the streets to protest vote rigging in parliamentary elections in 2011 mr navalny , whose politics combine liberalism with an earthy nationalism , refused to back down when returned to the presidency in 2012 determined to suppress the incipient democracy movement and reduce individual and news media freedoms over the last two years , the government has harassed him , filing corruption charges in several cases , none of them justified , independent legal analysts said but the kremlin has been leery of treating him too harshly , wary of provoking a backlash on tuesday , an infuriated mr navalny left the courthouse after receiving a threeandahalfyear suspended sentence and began walking through the streets toward manezh square , near the kremlin , where the unauthorized rally was to take place , but he never made it he was stopped by the police , officials said , not to arrest him but merely to escort him back to his apartment he has been under house arrest for 10 months in the case widely understood to be political retribution for his aggressive opposition to  you just asked about house arrest well , house arrest is irrelevant in comparison with what is going on in our country , he said in a brief phone interview with the echo of moscow radio station as he walked along it s not about my brother , my family or myself , or any other concrete person it s about the disgusting , mean things happening now , happening for years now , because we have just been sitting at home he was seized by the police outside the ritz carlton hotel on tverskaya street , which he had just joked that his supporters should take by storm because it would be more comfortable than where he would probably spend the night in the end , though , the authorities seemed equally determined to avoid further confrontation and returned him to his apartment , though they posted five officers outside the door not long after he was seized , the riot police moved in to disperse the rally on manezh square , where the crowd had dwindled to about 1 , 500 more than 200 people were arrested , but there were no reports of violence the kremlin s relatively cautious treatment of mr navalny may have been reinforced lately by the country s mounting economic problems although the annexation of crimea last spring pushed mr putin s popularity to stratospheric heights , the ensuing western sanctions and a simultaneous worldwide drop in oil prices have battered the russian economy and the fortunes of average russians , whom the kremlin is anxious not to antagonize larger economic and geopolitical concerns may have also factored into the decision to keep mr navalny out of jail , to avoid yet another point of contention with the west the suspended sentence will keep mr navalny out of prison , but under russian law , his felony conviction makes him ineligible to seek public office for 10 years after the sentence is completed and even if he intended to make a swift return to the political arena , his actions would now be shadowed by fear of harm befalling his brother in prison in a recent interview published in the newspaper novaya gazeta , oleg navalny , who , like his brother , is married and has two young children , said he understood the risks of his brother s political activism we absolutely knew that sooner or later this all would touch us , he said it is easy to influence a person through his family outside the courtroom , several dozen supporters of mr navalny said they believed that his brother s sentence was meant to punish him so they have taken him hostage , said vera kashtanova , a 70yearold retiree huddled in a heavy fur coat against the morning frost ms kashtanova said that she had not joined in protests , either during the soviet era or under mr putin , until this year , after russia s annexation of crimea i am a sovok , she said , using slang that means an oldfashioned soviet person but i am an enlightened sovok as with last year of another putin enemy , the former oil tycoon mikhail b khodorkovsky , the verdict seemed to underscore the allencompassing power and capriciousness of the russian leader and the system that he appears to command , often by oblique signals after nearly a year under house arrest , mr navalny , a lawyer who that followed parliamentary elections tainted by accusations of fraud in december 2011 , and who then , has said he no longer had hope that russia s future can be determined at the ballot box what are we going to go out on the streets for \? he asked in a recent interview there are no elections at all anymore talking about falsifications is absurd because none of us are allowed to run far from cowering , mr navalny has publicly and repeatedly accused mr putin and his closest associates in and out of the government of theft and corruption on a vast scale more recently , he accused them of fomenting war in ukraine to secure and expand power he has also made no secret of his presidential ambitions and though he has lived for years on the brink of lengthy imprisonment , he has shown no willingness to leave russia the way other prominent critics of mr putin have done in recent years , a former member of parliament , compared the sentencing of the opposition leader s brother to the policy of detaining relatives used in chechnya by the russian security services and a regional leader , ramzan a kadyrov , against islamic militants putin supports kadyrov s idea of punishing relatives , mr gudkov said mr navalny s twitter account , which has at times been managed by his wife or supporters after a court order prohibited him from using the internet , featured a message after the ruling saying , of all possible sentences , today s is the most vile the fraud case against mr navalny that was decided tuesday is just one of numerous criminal prosecutions that have been brought against him in recent years all of them are generally regarded as a response by the authorities to his political activism , mr navalny was convicted of embezzlement after being accused of stealing nearly 500 , 000 from a statecontrolled timber company while working as an unpaid adviser to the governor of the kirov region east of moscow in a dramatic scene , he was sentenced to five years in prison and led from the courtroom in handcuffs , only to be released the next day by a judge who agreed to hear an appeal in the case it was while free from prison in that case that mr navalny ran for mayor of moscow he drew a surprisingly strong 272 percent of the vote despite facing overwhelming obstacles in standing against the kremlinbacked incumbent , sergei s sobyanin in kirov , the charges were considered baseless by many legal experts and had been thrown out after a local investigation the case was resurrected by federal officials in moscow , and the kremlin made little effort to mask the political motivation of the prosecution

geneva under pressure from the number and intensity of humanitarian crises around the world , the international committee of the red cross said thursday it was trying to raise a record 16 billion to fund its 2015 operations the new budget , which is 25 percent higher than the initial budget for 2014 , is needed to meet the needs and fit our response to the changing nature of armed conflict , the organization s president , peter maurer , said in a statement we are witnessing new kinds of crises , in new combinations , often with a regional dimension we are no longer simply facing traditional internal or international armed conflict levels of violence and atrocities against civilians are losing none of their intensity and are further aggravating the humanitarian situation already impaired by decades of conflict , mr maurer said , citing conflicts in afghanistan , the democratic republic of congo and somalia as examples the icrc , respected for its neutrality and humanitarian mission , said that it was increasingly challenged in trying to gain access to people in need and that it was facing of growing security constraints , highlighting a growing danger to all humanitarian aid workers in conflicts medical personnel , facilities and transport are being targeted by armed groups in several countries , mr maurer said not only does this violence hinder access to health care but it also weakens the health services themselves , he added three international staff members have died in conflicts this year , in the central african republic , libya and ukraine , the organization reported , and 40 members of the syrian arab red crescent , its main partner coordinating humanitarian aid operations , have been killed since the start of the civil war in syria nearly four years ago it s been a very tough year for us , a spokeswoman for the icrc , dibeh fakhr , said the organization said its biggest operation in 2015 would remain syria , accounting for about a tenth of the total budget the group also plans big outlays in south sudan , afghanistan , iraq , somalia and the democratic republic of congo its other major areas of activity include israel and the territories , mali , the central african republic and ukraine with 86 percent of the budget assigned to field operations , the icrc said its priorities in 2015 included increasing surgical care for the wounded , health care for people in detention and reinforcing its response to the humanitarian needs of migrants and those displaced by conflict another priority is strengthening its response to sexual violence in africa , central america and parts of the middle east , it said but the overriding challenge now , mr maurer said , is to find more innovative ways of bringing aid effectively and rapidly to those in need , and to take into account their own views on what they need

kabul , afghanistan the afghan presidential candidate abdullah abdullah intensified his political brinkmanship on thursday , insisting that he would not accept any result put forth by the country s election commission as his supporters appeared to be gearing up for street protests essentially turning his back on the entire election process , mr abdullah , who was the leading votewinner in the first round of voting , said he could no longer trust the system to address his accusations of widespread fraud and collusion against him in the recent presidential runoff vote a day after his call to halt votecounting and start an investigation into ballotbox stuffing went unheeded by the independent election commission , he told his supporters on thursday that he would leave the next steps to them the people of afghanistan will make their own decisions , he said i will stand beside them , and we will make our decision along with them many observers interpreted mr abdullah s words as paving the way for protests in kabul and other cities , posing a new security concern for afghan and western officials alike those signs were already emerging on thursday , with a small gathering of a few hundred protesters in kabul this procedure is totally illegitimate , and whatever the result is going to be , it is not acceptable for us , mr abdullah said during his news conference on thursday , repeating his accusations of a threepart conspiracy by his opponent , ashraf ghani , the election commission and president hamid karzai regrettably , this issue has formed a political deadlock , and as the election commission , the complaints commission and the president of afghanistan have not reacted to the people of afghanistan , they will be responsible for this political deadlock and its consequences it was the latest escalation of a crisis that is turning into a nightmarish turn of events for western officials , who had hoped a smooth election would stand as a landmark success for their involvement in afghanistan instead , after a first round of voting that was generally seen as a success , they now face the possibility of a discredited election and , some fear , the reigniting of factional hostilities that had seemed to ease over the years of mr karzai s administration the united states responded to the growing uproar on thursday , urging both candidates to remain engaged with the electoral process as called for by afghan law the united states wishes to reiterate the need for both campaigns to continue to work with the afghan electoral bodies , which have the responsibility of administering and adjudicating this electoral process , jen psaki , the state department spokeswoman , said in a statement we also call upon these institutions to provide assurances that concerns will be given careful and impartial attention the endgame for mr abdullah politically and personally is unclear , with the afghan government , the united nations and now the state department all calling for the electoral process to continue as planned despite his boycott he has , in effect , rejected the only process that could legally make him president mr abdullah raised the possibility on wednesday that a joint commission of the candidates under the supervision of the united nations could investigate , but he backed away from that on thursday we do not want anything from the international community , he said , except upholding their impartiality during this process the candidate s decision comes after days of accusations that mr ghani and mr karzai had engineered a fraud that inflated initial tallies by up to two million ballots , or nearly a third of all the estimated votes cast in the runoff election mr abdullah s campaign has pointed to several strongholds of mr ghani , where vote tallies are believed to have doubled and even tripled in the second round on wednesday , mr abdullah called for a halt to all votecounting so that an investigation could be conducted , and for the removal of a top figure in the election commission embroiled in allegations of illegal activity none of those demands were acted on , however , and on thursday , mr abdullah said he was left with no choice but to reject any future findings of the commission i want to assure the afghan people that the decision that we have made is just to protect their rights and that there is no personal interest involved , he said i want to request all of our supporters to consider the people s safety and to observe afghan law under all circumstances in a country troubled by civil strife , including along ethnic lines , the words offered little comfort though mr abdullah has made no overt appeals to ethnic factionalism , and has spent years brokering relationships with the country s pashtun majority , his support base remains strongest among the country s ethnic tajik minority some western officials have privately aired fears in recent days that even peaceful protests on a large scale could quickly descend into violence in a country that has been at war for more than a generation the protest in kabul on thursday , while peaceful , was charged with the sort of speech that has prompted some companies that employ expats in the capital to consider evacuating the country death to fraud , death to fraudsters , shouted a phalanx of roughly 300 university students in front of zarnegar park in downtown kabul on thursday afternoon the young men promised to remain in place until their demands , which largely hewed to mr abdullah s , were met we do n't want instability in afghanistan , but we want to see everyone gets what he deserves , said mohammad hashim radmard , 24 , an organizer and university student the fraudsters must be punished , and the fraudulent votes must be separated from the clean votes expectations of largerscale protests did not come only from the students arrayed in kabul s downtown thursday it is the beginning of the crisis unfortunately , said mohaydeen mahdi , a member of the afghan parliament and a supporter of mr abdullah there are expectations of major protests on saturday , which could draw as many as 100 , 000 people
juneau , alaska sudden twists of fate make great political theater in the rise of bill walker , alaska s unlikely next governor , it was a missed airplane flight on the friday before labor day mr walker , a 63yearold businessman and lawyer who last held elective office in the 1970s , as mayor of the small town of valdez , was running as an independent candidate with no party , little money and almost no chance of victory going into that holiday weekend two months before election day , people in both parties said the incumbent governor , sean parnell , a republican in a rightleaning state , was facing two opponents on the ballot mr walker and a democrat , byron mallott who would most likely split the state s moderates and liberals and he had the wind in his sails , with support for republicans here and across the nation surging election to a second full term looked like a walk but that friday morning , just a few days before a state deadline to make any changes to the ballot , mr walker missed his flight from anchorage for a campaign swing to the rural community of bethel , in far western alaska , where he would have no cellphone coverage as he fumed at the airport , he called mr mallott was there any way , he asked , they might combine forces \? i told him i wanted to be able to look at my supporters on nov 4 and say i did everything i could , mr walker said in an interview mr mallott , 71 , a native alaskan of tlingit heritage and a former mayor of juneau , had been soul searching on his own he had taken a long walk alone near his home , he said in an interview , and concluded that neither he nor mr walker had any hope of winning alone but he was also suddenly resolved that defeating mr parnell , who turned 52 after the election , was an absolute priority , and that together they might have a chance so in what may be perhaps the great thunderclap example of ego control in the 2014 elections , in this or any state , mr mallott said he would forfeit the democratic party nomination for governor and join forces with mr walker on the independent ballot line as mr walker s lieutenant governor candidate we ca n't afford ideology , mr mallott said in an interview in a downtown juneau cafe his distaste for zealots , of any stripe , he added , had led him to support moderate democrats and republicans in the past , and his respect for mr walker had deepened into trust during this campaign season their lastminute unity ticket , as the walkermallott team called it , squeaked through on election day , winning by about 6 , 200 votes out of 285 , 000 cast one of the closest elections for governor in state history if i had n't missed the flight to bethel , this would just not have happened , mr walker said here in juneau , the foggy and rainy capital , where republicans still control both chambers of the legislature , discerning what mr walker will bring to town when he takes office next monday , and what kind of reception he 'll receive , is the parlor game of the hour what s he going to do \? what s it going to look like \? said state senator john coghill , the majority leader and a 17year veteran in the legislature mr coghill said he planned to give the new governor , a huge benefit of the doubt , an opendoor willingness to work but , he added , it s going to be a relationshipbuilding exercise probably this first year democrats said their support of mr mallott s decision was crucial the unity ticket , said state representative chris tuck , the minority leader in the house , would have never happened without the democratic party s support , and bill walker realizes that mr walker , for his part , said he wanted the best alaskans in his administration , forget the labels we 're not going to go and do the math and figure out how many republicans , how many democrats , how many this , how many that we 're not going to do that , mr walker said of his stillunderconstruction cabinet alaska wanted a change , and i think the change they wanted is that they 're tired of the fight they 're tired of the battles back and forth of majority and minority one veteran observer of juneau s dynamics said that mr walker , whatever his plans or ideals , would be walking into a lion s den of experienced players used to having their way in an election so closely decided , you have no mandate , none whatsoever , said john harris , a former republican speaker , now a lobbyist and you have a very secure legislature that s been through the battles mr walker , a former republican who first ran for governor in 2010 , losing to mr parnell in a primary , talked on the campaign trail this year about his own battles and what they taught him his family lost nearly everything in the 1964 earthquake that shattered huge parts of alaska he worked his way through college as a carpenter and laborer , then , after law school , developed an expertise in oil and gas law , which has been his main work over the last decade his campaign emphasized the rough edges of his alaskan story , and his plainspoken style on the stump often made him sound more like the carpenter he had once been than the lawyer he became in describing the sometimes rocky relationships between governors and their lieutenants , for example , he talked in the interview about how he and mr mallott would be different because of how they had come together voluntarily , rather than through a political compromise or vote in alaska , the voters pick who is going to dance together , and it s not always a good couple , he said we picked each other alaskans have embraced moldshattering governors before sarah palin swept into office in 2006 as a populist republican , promising to clean cobwebs and corruption in the legislature walter j hickel was elected governor as a republican in the 1960s , then again in 1990 as the alaskan independence party s candidate ms palin also endorsed mr walker in the final weeks of the campaign though people in both parties said they were unsure how much weight , or perhaps baggage , the endorsement carried i think she may have hurt as much as she helped , mr mallott said but mr tuck , the minority leader , said that he saw in the emerging walker administration an echo of the palin era , when she reached across the aisle to democrats , before her national rise to prominence as the vicepresidential candidate in 2008 the new team s path will not be easy , with or without party politics alaska faces a budget shortfall of perhaps 2 billion , largely caused by plummeting oil prices and production that have sapped tax collections that pay for most of the state budget pressure to maintain or cut programs will be ferocious , lawmakers said mr walker , who like mr mallott was born in alaska , said he had no desire for elective office after his years as governor but he did hint at a legacy , or at least the idea of planting seeds for longerterm change he wants to reach out to young people , especially those , he said , who otherwise would n't have an opportunity , through the normal partisan process , and harness their energy and idealism to work for the good of the state , not a particular party i think alaska is ready to say , let s put down the fight , let s just be alaskan'
there was a windstorm of hasty excuses in recent weeks after kansas reported that it took in in the 2014 fiscal year and would have to dip heavily into a reserve fund spending was n't cut enough , said conservatives too many rich people sold off stock in the previous year , state officials said it s the price of creating jobs , said gov sam brownback none of those reasons were correct there was only one reason for the state s plummeting revenues , and that was the spectacularly illadvised income tax cuts that mr brownback and his fellow republicans engineered in 2012 and 2013 the cuts , which largely benefited the wealthy , cost the state 8 percent of the revenue it needs for schools and other government services as , that s about the same as the effect of a midsize recession moody s in april for the first time in at least 13 years , citing the cuts and a lack of confidence in the state s fiscal management the 2012 cuts were among the largest ever enacted by a state , reducing the top tax bracket by 25 percent and eliminating all taxes on business profits that are reported on individual income returns \( no other state has ever eliminated all taxes on these passthrough businesses \) the cuts were arrogantly promoted by mr brownback with the same disproven theory that republicans have employed for decades there will be no loss of revenue because of all the economic growth ! our new progrowth tax policy will be like a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the kansas economy , it will pave the way to the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs , bring tens of thousands of people to kansas , and help make our state the best place in america to start and grow a small business but the growth did n't show up kansas , in fact , was to lose employment over the last six months , while the rest of the country was improving it has been below the national average in job gains for the three and half years mr brownback has been in office average earnings in the state are down since 2012 , and so is net growth in the number of registered businesses with less money to spend , kansas is forced to chop away at its only hope for real economic expansion investment in public schools and colleges while most states began restoring education funding after the recession , kansas has cut k12 spending by 2 percent over the last two school years , and higher education by 3 percent since 2012 the evidence of failure is piling up around mr brownback , whose reelection campaign is faltering because of his mistake yet he continues to cling to his magical ideology , pleading for more time it s like going through surgery , it takes a while to heal and get growing afterwards but it s not clear the patient can recover from this surgery the reserve fund , in fact , is likely to nearly run dry next year as kansas has clearly shown , states cannot cut their way to prosperity they need to use every tool of government to nurture growth , and those tools require money
season 2 , episode 10 below the belt if only lives could be mended as easily as a bit of nail polish can fix a run in a woman s stocking , or as quickly as a lullaby can soothe a baby or as sweetly as shared confidences can build friendships lester \( kevin christy \) and barbara \( betsy brandt \) seem to hope that by swapping secrets and facing the truth about their own sexual problems they can find a path toward healing and resolution , something that dr william masters has failed to provide they confess to having given up on sex , but there was a hint of promise for those two , in more ways than one the same may be true for other characters in this series but with just two episodes left in the second season , masters of sex has taken a long time to move beyond some of the underlying personal and professional conflicts that have hindered the career trajectories of these research pioneers into human sexuality bill masters \( michael sheen \) and virginia johnson \( lizzy caplan \) in this episode , bill faces immense pressures at work and with his family , and is haunted by the failures in his past hospital career and fearful of being not being able to provide for his family toward the end of the hour , in their elegant hotel room , bill surrenders any pretense of composure as he crumples into the arms of the only person he trusts , virginia if the closing embrace between the two and bill s gasping sounds are what they appear to be the couple s complex relationship is shifting into another level of discovery betty s best lines from the start , bill faces the realities of running a business as the lights literally go out in his offices while he s examining a patient and betty moretti \( annaleigh ashford \) comically explains to bill that the clinic s financial condition is fairly bleak in part because he keeps rejecting possible tenants for the building as too unseemly for his patients to encounter if he won t agree to leasing more space , she argues , he ll be doing pelvic exams with a miner s lamp stuck to your forehead and if they don t achieve a stronger footing come winter to pay for heating , she threatens to hose down the marble floors and turn the lobby into a commercial skating rink the rush of rivalries upon learning that another researcher has published a study on sexual dysfunction in a medical journal , bill worries that their own work will be eclipsed he suggests to virginia that they hire a publicist to plan how best to attain recognition while she initially dislikes the idea mentioning the expense she warms to the notion once bill introduces her to a public relations expert , shep tally , who is played by none other than the guest star and director of this episode , adam arkin bill tells virginia that mr tally represented dr john rock , one of the researchers who developed the birth control pill \( which was approved in 1960 for general use as a contraceptive \) but when the two of them begin arguing over the pace of their work and how to present it publicly , shep seems charmed by their backandforth and proposes putting them on television the two of you could finally teach america how to have sex , he says later , bill balks at hiring shep , fretting to virginia that he was hoping to achieve renown through articles in medical journals not in tv guide , and his ego looms quite ambitiously here i want to win a nobel prize , bill declares imagine what will happen when grandma turns on the tv and sees the two of us discussing swollen labia most interesting to me was bill s reminder of the public s revulsion at sex pioneers , notably dr wilhelm reich , a psychoanalyst whose views on the social and physical therapeutic value of orgasm first caused a stir in europe and then here in the states after he emigrated and was selling boxes called the orgone energy accumulator \( it s quite well explained in this review of christopher turner s 2011 book , adventures in the orgasmatron wilhelm reich and the invention of sex while the review is by no means the definitive account , it s a great synopsis so is this one by christopher hitchens \) while reich s boxes apparently enthralled the likes of norman mailer , william burroughs and others in the 1950s and continued into the 1960s during the socalled sexual revolution , the food and drug administration pursued charges against reich when he defied orders to stop selling them and making certain claims about them he died in prison , bill notes , and his books were burned \( sometimes this show evokes such rich history that i find myself pleasantly lost in researching the references and learning along the way with some amusement that reich s machine was apparently the inspiration for woody allen s orgasmatron in sleeper \) life \( and lice \) lessons for libby my dives into history took yet another turn as bill s wife , libby \( caitlin fitzgerald \) , refused to stay on the sidelines when robert franklin \( jocko sims \) and other civil rights workers began canvassing a st louis housing project , the pruittigoe , to solicit support for a rent strike robert warns that the projects are infested with rats and lice \( i think we both know how you feel about lice , robert reminds her of her shameful actions toward his sister , coral , in a previous episode \) but she shows up anyway , having enlisted virginia to be her alibi bill disapproves of her volunteer work with the congress of racial equality and she becomes quite pleased with herself for persuading tenants to consider the strike , although it s more than evident that she is also seeking robert s approval and trying to prove to him and perhaps to virginia and herself that she can be more than a bored housewife \( readers keep searching for a romantic blossoming between robert and libby did you catch both bill s and virginia s curious glances toward the interactions between robert and libby inside the core offices \? are those clues \? \) and while the show s writers seem intent on broadening libby s role into a stronger female character , which is noble , i suppose , they also use the dawn of the civil rights era to provide a historical sense of place a rent strike did occur in the desotocarr neighborhood , with its warren of highrise buildings where a predominantly impoverished black populace lived in the 1960s the strike was considered one , if not the first , of such successful actions \( the buildings have their own historical place in discussions about urban renewal you can look it up and they have since been demolished \) brutal bonds the returning appearance of christian borle as bill s brother , frank , results in wrenching drama for the second week in a row , as their sibling rivalry descends again into a twist of memories about their father bill will only refer to him as a monster , and frank s persistent efforts to make amends as part of his recovery from alcoholism lead to a violent conclusion everyone in their lives , from frank s wife , pauline \( marin ireland \) , to their mother encourages bill to repair his relationship with his younger brother bill insists to pauline that there are no fences to mend yet frank seems just as intent on yanking out even more posts in the tattered family fence , projecting his alcoholism onto his brother s drinking , and in a scene following a car accident injuring their mother , onto her affinity for a nightly cocktail or two i won t mock the 12 steps of recovery taught to alcoholics through aa , as bill and his mother do in a rather unusual alignment that somehow affords them another avenue toward reconciliation lullabies never worked with you , essie \( ann dowd \) tells bill as she sings bill s baby to sleep early on in this episode frank , though , would hum away , she added , relating that her younger son now explains away his chipper demeanor as an act of selfpreservation for inexplicable reasons , bill refuses to accept frank s version of an unhappy childhood at the hands of their abusive father , and it winds the tension up to one of the ugliest scenes this season the feud over which of the two owns the most sufferingfilled upbringing is a repeat refrain from last week and still confounds me perhaps bill s anger at frank deriding him as a pathetic clown and asking what kind of man would forgive their monster of a father represents denial in its purest form of pathological repression frank earnestly tries to persuade bill that his own outbursts , and his impulsive behavior , mirror their father s behavior as a drunk brutally insulting frank as he did to his mother years ago when he banished her from the masters household , bill resurrects the coping mechanism he used against his father it s the one that he divulged to virginia in the fight episode he yells at frank i bet once he threw the first punch you begged for mercy you know i never begged , so why did you \? after accusing frank of being weak , not just a sloppy alcoholic , the two brawl in bill s office a blowbyblow resort to the methods employed by their father when they were boys it may seem a trite ploy , the abused continuing a cycle of violence and two brothers using each other as punching bags , but nevertheless , this scene also breaks bill wide open the fixer after the fight , bill runs to his refuge , the hotel , where virginia had been waiting to act out another sexcapade to help bill overcome his impotence \( an earlier scene in which virginia tied bill s hands behind his back , bared her breasts but wouldn t allow him to touch her , was depicted so sensuously that i think her methods might have cured a viewer or two \) shocked at his bleeding wounds and bloodied shirt , virginia rushes to comfort him you re the only one who can fix me , bill had told her during a flashback scene in which they talked about his problems and only to virginia does he finally admit that he abandoned his brother , left him behind as his replacement for their father s abuse , and then punished him for years i give up , bill moans virginia kisses his bloodied hands , holding them he streaks her face with some of the blood running down a cut on his cheek somehow , completely laid bare by his realizations and with virginia at his side , bill begins to heal notes and questions there were odd scenes between dr playboy \( dr austin langham , acted by teddy sears \) , the new calometric spokesman , and this diet pill s promoter , flo it s the mirror image of virginia s situation with bill , who as her employer insisted that having sex with him was part of her job description flo \( artemis pebdani \) demands regular sex from austin as a guarantee of his employment , much to his consternation \( would a female employer really have that kind of gumption in the early 1960s \? \) also not mentioned was how dr lloyd madden , the psychiatrist with whom virginia has been posing as barbara to seek guidance for treating her , was on to virginia is it still credible for virginia to assert that despite her relationship with a married man \( bill \) , his marriage is not at risk \? do you believe , as frank does , that bill is an alcoholic \? certainly bill overdrinks in tense situations , although he refuses to attribute his overall condition to imbibing too many cocktails what else have i missed \? feel free to share your insights in the comments section below thanks for reading
washington like a trailer for a summer blockbuster , the video begins with loud music and the words coming soon but instead of superheroes or comedians on screen , there are images of a burning american flag and a jetliner hitting the world trade center , and the words join the caravan of jihad and martyrdom as the music fades away , the blurred face of a man appears he makes a direct appeal to americans to join the fight the video ends with footage of a united states passport being burned men are heard laughing and shouting an arabic phrase about god s greatness although the recruitment video has circulated among extremist groups for some days , intelligence analysts now believe the man with the blurred face is a last month in a suicide attack on syrian government forces that killed 37 , according to senior american government officials the man , moner mohammad abusalha , who took his own life in a truck bombing mission , is one of roughly 100 americans who have tried to travel to to fight alongside islamic extremists , or who have actually done so american officials express deep concerns that the may inspire others to follow his path the american authorities had tracked his indirect travels to syria , but they knew very little about him at the time it is not illegal to travel there , and many others have done so for humanitarian reasons it was only after he arrived in syria that the authorities here learned through intelligence sources that he was planning a suicide attack , senior american officials said once mr abusalha s intentions were clear , there was little the united states could do to stop him because there are no american or allied forces in syria , and certainly none who could have taken action inside the militant organization that mr abusalha had joined , according to government officials had the authorities known before he arrived in syria that he intended to fight alongside extremists , they most likely would have had enough evidence to charge him with providing material support to terrorists , as they have done with several other americans the officials declined to say how the united states obtained intelligence that he was fighting alongside militants and was planning to blow himself up in a suicide truckbomb attack but in the past year , the authorities have obtained similar information in syria from contacts on the ground , electronic intercepts like cellphones and foreign intelligence agencies as the unrest in syria has spread into iraq recently , and the group islamic state in iraq and syria has gained ground , american and european authorities have grown increasingly concerned that some of their citizens may be traveling to syria to take up the militants' cause one area of concern in the united states is minnesota , where the fbi has received reports that several young men of somali descent there have traveled to syria to fight , officials said starting in 2007 , a number of men of somali descent in minnesota and elsewhere in the united states have traveled to somalia to fight alongside islamist extremists at least three carried out suicide attacks there there s an active investigation ongoing to discern how many have traveled there , said kyle loven , a spokesman for the fbi s minneapolis field office there have been countless videos , twitter posts and other pieces of propaganda released by extremists since the terror attacks of sept 11 , 2001 a number of them have highlighted american citizens but this video is believed to be the first that features an american in the expanding attempts to recruit other americans to go fight in syria it comes amid growing fears among american and european officials about young men flocking to fight in syria and iraq , who may return as battlehardened fighters to commit violence at home we 've had saudis , algerians , russians but never an american featured in a propaganda video , and americans are the best poster boys for propaganda , said laith alkhouri , a senior analyst at flashpoint global partners , a security consulting firm that tracks militant websites , referring to the conflict in syria it is the united states who is leading the war on terror and what they 're saying is , we have americans , we are here to welcome americans do n't hesitate to travel to come join the fight' although the suicide bomber was not identified by nationality or name , a video was circulated last month that appears to have documented mr abusalha s mission that previous video shows rebels loading what appear to be tank shells into a large vehicle that had been armored with metal plates later , there is a large explosion after the vehicle drives down a road mr abusalha was born in florida , and was known as mo in high school , he would often sneak out to pray instead of study his mother is american and his father they owned grocery stores in the vero beach , fla , area after graduating from high school , he enrolled in three colleges but dropped out of each , and in 2012 , he told friends he was moving to orlando shortly thereafter he told friends he was moving to jordan to take courses as a nursing assistant in the past year , he lost touch with his parents his friends believe that he was recruited by extremists while he was living in jordan in syria , he adopted a nom de guerre , abu huraira alamriki he spent two months in a training camp of nusra front , the militant group , in aleppo before going to the northern province of idlib , where he carried out the suicide attack in the video clip of the man with the blurred face , he points at the camera and pats his chest as he describes why americans should travel to syria to fight he uses the arabic word haq , which means divine obligation jihad is protecting islam , he said it is now haq on you to protect your brothers and oppressed , and it s haq on you to fight , he said the video that appeared to feature the suicide bomber was released last month by the global islamic media front that group has put out similar ones from al qaeda and other terrorist groups the video did not say which group the suicide bomber had joined but it has been billed as a preview for a larger clip that will soon be released about an american martyr who died fighting a holy war in syria , according to analysts who monitor extremists' websites and online chatter
new delhi in many ways , soni sori , a tribal rights activist from chhattisgarh , is a natural fit with the aam aadmi party , which recently named her as one of its three candidates for parliament in the central indian state the 39yearold is a crusader for tribal rights , rallying against a police force she has accused of torture and corruption , and her ideology fits with the populist manifesto of the aam aadmi party , which translates as the common man party and as a woman contesting from a rural seat far from delhi , she represents demographics the party needs if it is to be considered a national one we want women , we want courageous women , we want educated women , and we want activists , said prashant bhushan , a lawyer and senior aam aadmi party leader , who initially reached out to ms sori last month to see whether she would run as an aam aadmi candidate in the lok sabha , or lower house of parliament , elections this spring but ms sori represents a problem for the party as well until she was granted interim bail by the supreme court in november , which was made permanent in february , she had been imprisoned in chhattisgarh on charges of waging or attempting to wage war against the government of india , among others , after being arrested in new delhi in 2011 her case is still pending in a chhattisgarh state court , though the party and many activists dismiss the charges as baseless also , aam aadmi s attempt to reach beyond delhi through candidates who support a wide range of causes could create some tension within a party that has yet to settle on a core ideology its members can rally around the diversity of candidates offered in this year s election from journalists in delhi to the former chief executive of the royal bank of scotland s india unit , meera sanyal , in mumbai to activists like ms sori in chhattisgarh represents a party that moved at breakneck speed from its inception in november 2012 to contesting national elections in april and may of this year that diversity added to the fact that the party is relatively untested by actual governance , aside from the party leader arvind kejriwal s 49day term as delhi chief minister points to a party philosophy that raises more questions than answers going into the general elections taken as an example of the aam aadmi party s attempt to branch out , ms sori represents one of those questions her home district of dantewada is one of the conflictprone , mineralrich tribal belts of the state of chhattisgarh , where maoists also called naxalites for the naxalbari region of west bengal where the movement sprouted wage a bloody civil war against the state a counterinsurgency supported by the government has engaged in an oftenviolent campaign since 2005 to cleanse the villages of maoist rebels , with tribals , also known as adivasis , caught in between in 2006 , an anonymous official told the new york times that 60 percent of dantewada was offlimits to civil servants because of maoist control in an interview in new delhi in february , ms sori said that she , like so many adivasis , was one of the casualties of this conflict she said that she and her nephew were wrongfully arrested and framed on charges of supporting maoists and orchestrating payoffs between them and the mining company essar group she has said that she was tortured , sexually assaulted and that she had stones inserted into her vagina in police custody amnesty international has called her a prisoner of conscience , and she organized women who were charged with similar crimes to fight for their rights in prison when i was in jail , i told these women , you tolerate so much physical torture how can you not have the strength to stand up for yourself \? ms sori was born to a village council head who cultivated rice , and her uncle was a member of the legislative assembly in the area for the communist party of india she said that she felt more affinity to mr kejriwal s rhetoric than to that of the communist party she is a bit of a cause c l bre in delhi beyond being courted by mr bhushan , she met with the author arundhati roy and himanshu kumar , a gandhian activist who was her teacher in dantewada before , he says , he was expelled by the government for questioning counterinsurgency tactics the former tehelka managing editor shoma chaudhury wrote an impassioned defense of ms sori in 2011 when she was first arrested in delhi and transferred back to chhattisgarh , before her alleged sexual assault in police custody i never thought the fight had gone so far , created so much awareness , ms sori said i m only realizing this now in delhi these are big experiences i m having here my cause is feeling bigger but the translation of her cause from one of prominence and even modishness in liberal delhi drawing rooms may be lost in a chaotic state with little stability aap is supporting these kinds of causes , but she is going to fail in a big way , said sushil trivedi , the former election commissioner from chhattisgarh because the aam aadmi party has no base here , they have no public face there should be some prominent people supporting her in his view , chhattisgarh will be a contest between the bharatiya janata party , or bjp , and the indian national congress party one of the biggest obstacles in her campaign is the maoist insurgency , whose members oppose democratic elections , preferring instead to take up armed struggle that may be a great problem for her and a great problem for maintaining law and order there , mr trivedi said even if she is elected , the election commission is strengthening its rules against lawmakers who are facing criminal charges on march 10 , the supreme court ordered that any current lawmakers facing criminal charges must have their cases wrapped up within a year of the charges being filed the aam aadmi party cited an independent report that analyzed the numbers of congress and bjp nominees with pending criminal cases , with no mention of its own fielding of ms sori days earlier in november s state assembly election , 3 percent of voters from chhattisgarh used the none of the above option on their ballot , including more than 9 , 000 people from dantewada , which mr trivedi interpreted as an expression of promaoist sentiment , but others see as an opportunity for the aam aadmi party to exploit they don t like the bjp , they don t like congress , said dinesh kumar dubey , a fulltime aam aadmi party volunteer from bilaspur they want another alternative but he said he wasn t sure that ms sori was the right alternative we have discussed it at the bilaspur office , and so many active members are against her , he said we want her cases cleared

in the languid news week after christmas , hungry media outlets swarmed over a report of piranhas attacking swimmers on a river in argentina massive piranha attack cried the new york post 70 christmas day bathers are savaged added the daily mail , promising the truth about the fish with a bite more powerful than a t rex abc news called it a christmas day feeding frenzy in fact , the injuries ranged from minor cuts to at least one missing finger part not exactly as newsworthy as , say , the 800 , 000 americans who require medical treatment for dog bites each year piranhas have always been among our favorite subjects for sheer , sputtering nonsense theodore roosevelt , on a 1913 expedition in south america , called piranhas the most ferocious fish in the world more recently , multiple piranha movies have ridden this hysteria to the bank this is an awful lot of hype for piranhas to live up to , and predictably , they disappoint to test the colorful mythology of the ferocious piranha , i once climbed into a tank of hungry redbellied piranhas at the dallas world aquarium \( they fled to the opposite corner \) in the peruvian amazon , i stood waistdeep in the rio napo while catching and releasing piranhas on a hookandline \( the nibbles were strictly of the usual kind \) in the flooded grasslands of venezuela , i drove around tossing a chicken carcass into various bodies of water to time how long it took for the fleshmaddened swarms to strip it to feathers \( there was enough chicken left at the end of the day to feed a family of four \) the point of this exercise , recounted in my book swimming with piranhas at feeding time , was that piranhas do that swarming , bloodcrazed , fleshripping thing only in a couple of rare circumstances , both involving a highly concentrated food source they will swarm around bird rookeries , where the fledglings leaving the nest often tumble straight down into the water and they 'll do it around docks where fishermen clean their catch and heave the guts into the water otherwise , you can swim without fear i did n't worry about piranhas , for instance , when the only place to bathe , on a recent trip deep into the backcountry of suriname , was the river running past our camp then one day , sitting in a canoe , i watched the fish biologist on our expedition , jan h mol of the university of suriname , pull a 12inchlong black piranha out of the same water where we took our daily baths as this extremely toothy creature wriggled in his hands , mr mol started talking , in his somewhat ponderous way , about a paper he had published on piranhabite incidents , complete with color photos of amputated toes like me , mr mol believes the piranha threat is wildly exaggerated he has spent more than 20 years wading in south american rivers and hauling up every imaginable fish without ever being injured by freeswimming piranhas freeswimming is , however , the operative phrase there if you get careless while trying to untangle one from a net , or you let one flop around the bottom of the boat , things can get painful as he spoke , mr mol was using the soft pad of his index finger to hold down the piranha s sharply serrated lower jaw and give me a better view it was a formidable mouthful but that index finger rather spoiled the effect of another recent study , in the journal nature , which found that the black piranha s bite is more powerful , pound for pound , than that of a great white shark or a killer whale yes , yes , that article also mentioned t rex , but pound for pound \( or as the authors put it , removing the effects of body size \) turns out to be another of those pesky operative phrases we chatted briefly about the classic studies by the brazilian researcher ivan sazima , who observed piranhas in the clearwater ponds and creeks of south america s vast pantanal wetlands mr sazima found that these generally timid little fish mainly feed by nipping off fins and scales from passing fish , not by ripping their flesh mr sazima is also an author of a paper with the lovely title scavenging on human corpses as a source for stories about maneating piranhas it concluded that when human bodies turn up in the water with signs of piranha attack , it s almost certainly because the piranhas were scavenging on people who were already dead even piranha specialists would struggle to come up with a dozen cases over the past halfcentury in which multiple living human victims were injured in the two cases mr mol investigated in northwestern suriname , one in the 1950s and the other in the early 2000s , most of the victims suffered a single relatively minor bite on the feet or legs he found that in each case , there was a factor that attracted piranhas to the area fishermen gutting their catch nearby or holiday visitors spilling food in the river mr mol theorized that the piranhas bit humans by accident at first , and then , recognizing a newly abundant food source , began to take advantage of it other fish specialists i spoke to or emailed the other day argued that those incidents , and the more recent one in rosario , argentina , were all cases of defensive biting christmas day was unusually hot in rosario about 100 degrees fahrenheit and people were crowding into the river it s also mating season for the three local piranha species it s likely , said prosanta chakrabarty , a fish biologist at louisiana state university , that bathers inadvertently wandered into male breeding territories , provoking a brief but hostile response none of the attacks escalated into a classic piranha swarm it was n't , as the daily mail reported , like a scene from a horror film with swimmers being savaged by shoals of the razortoothed fish , which ripped away chunks of their naked and exposed flesh victims were able to walk back to the beach without being attacked by other piranhas other beachgoers were back in the water a halfhour later so what s the bottom line on piranhas \? if something is potentially dangerous to humans , it will be dangerous in certain conditions , mr mol told me , as we sat in the canoe that day in suriname but those conditions are extremely rare , and the danger tends to be highly limited we ate the piranha for dinner that night , and i continued to bathe in the river but this is the thing about human nature now and then i also paused to count my toes
the slick cosmos a spacetime odyssey , with neil degrasse tyson surveying millions of years in dulcet tones , is one way to use television for science education or , you could just dress a guy in a chainmail suit , hit him with a million volts of electricity and see how charbroiled he gets that s what tim shaw does in the monday night premiere of a frisky , fastmoving series on the national geographic channel mr shaw , the show s host , sets up outlandish demonstrations and asks onlookers what they think will happen then he explains the science of what actually did happen one of the stunts in the premiere makes use of a tesla coil , which produces a sort of artificial lightning first mr shaw uses it to zap a dead pig wrapped in tinfoil , to see if the beast will turn into barbecued pork then he switches to a living human volunteer the first two episodes will also enlighten you on what will happen to marshmallows if the air is sucked out of the container holding them , and what you get if you mix flour and ice cream and put the mess in a microwave in another amusing segment , mr shaw doubles down on the old parlor trick in which a tablecloth is pulled out from under the dishes sitting on it he sets a long table for 24 and connects the tablecloth to a cord the other end of the cord attaches to a stock car , which speeds off , providing a lesson in friction and inertia these bits may have the feel of barroom bets several actually take place in bars and the show does n't have the perspective and interconnectedness of but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in verve
when the university of texas at el paso stages its free performance of handel s englishlanguage opera acis and galatea this saturday , it will mark the latest expression of a centuryold connection between el paso and bhutan the production the culmination of a collaboration among the university , the el paso opera and the bhutanese royal academy of performing arts got off the ground in 2004 , when aaron carpen , 50 , an australiaborn conductor based in italy had an idea to stage a western opera in the himalayan kingdom aaron casually asked me if opera had ever been performed in bhutan , recalled preston scott , a former adviser to the bhutanese government i looked into it and found that it had n't and that s where the idea was born over the next few years , mr carpen , mr scott and the italian director stefano vizioli approached several opera companies in europe , the united states and australia to find a partner but at the height of the recession , with shrinking budgets and declining audiences , none of the companies could take on the ambitious project in 2008 , an unlikely partner was contacted utep , a state school better known for its football team than for its music program but the alliance made perfect sense , given the university s deeprooted connection to bhutan in 1914 , the year the school was founded , national geographic published one of the first major dispatches from the kingdom two years later , what was then the state school of mines and metallurgy lost several major buildings in a fire inspired by , kathleen worrell , the wife of the dean , suggested that the new buildings be built in the bhutanese style since then , the cultural link has persisted most of the buildings on campus , even the parking garages , reflect the influence of bhutanese architecture , incorporating features like flared roofs and red brick banding intrigued by the prospect of strengthening the university s ties to bhutan while offering an unprecedented opportunity for students , the university president , diana natalicio , threw her support behind the opera project , which coincides with utep s centennial celebration the group planned to stage a performance in bhutan , then bring the production to el paso last september , 32 students , staff members and faculty embarked on the 24hour , fourflight journey to bhutan when they finally made it to thimphu , the capital , 12 time zones from el paso , they joined a group that included top baroque musicians and professional opera singers from italy , cameroon , the united states and canada the company spent two weeks in openair rehearsals often attended by curious passersby there were always lots of children and lots of dogs watching us , mr vizioli recalled acis and galatea , the story of a shepherd who falls in love with a semidivine nymph , was chosen because its pastoral setting and themes love , death , nature , reincarnation , mr vizioli said seemed relevant to a bhutanese audience but storytelling was the least of the group s challenges bhutan has a rich tradition of performance art , but little infrastructure in place to support a westernstyle production there were no proscenium theaters , said david grabarkewitz , artistic director of the el paso opera they have only two or three pianos in the entire country several of the instruments in the production , including a harpsichord and a bassoon , had never been played in bhutan the organizers wanted to bridge artistic gaps by integrating elements specific to bhutanese culture mr vizioli staged the performances outdoors and in the round , as is the tradition in bhutanese productions four bhutanese dancers , with masks and costumes , complemented the opera s action artists from the royal textile academy helped create costumes the month of rehearsals in bhutan culminated in a performance on a windy afternoon in front of a full house , which included dignitaries and members of the bhutanese royal family it was n't just an artistic experience , it was a deeply moving human experience , mr vizioli said it also expanded the worldview of both the dozen or so bhutanese dancers and musicians who will travel to el paso to perform in the final production at the end of the month , and utep students and staff emperatris cabrera , a senior from ju rez , mexico , had never traveled farther from home than salt lake city in bhutan , she enjoyed eating yak burgers and hearing strange musical instruments for the first time it was definitely culturally shocking , everything from the buildings to the restrooms to the fact that animals were everywhere , she said it was also inspirational ms cabrera will study ethnomusicology in graduate school , and plans to travel to india and thailand this year el paso is fairly isolated , said elisa wilson , an associate professor of music at the university and the production s chorus director for the students to experience going abroad , living in a completely different culture away from their support networks , and creating art in a professional environment it was life changing i saw them grow so much after this experience , these students wo n't be afraid to put themselves out there in the world
las vegas he is the most powerful force in the nba , his imprint extending beyond the four most valuable player awards and the two championships , the endorsement deals and the merchandise sales in recent days , even proved capable of slowing the frenzy of nba free agency to little more than a crawl , his options spread before him like an allyoucaneat buffet at the bellagio owners want to pay him executives want to woo him rivals want to pair up with him and as the basketballwatching world prepared for the inevitable fallout from james s meeting on wednesday with pat riley , the president of the , the lessons from the week were already clear james was in charge so the waiting continued for teams , which have limited money to spread around and would prefer that james choose them for many of james s fellow free agents , who cannot reach deals until the biggest domino falls for members of the news media , who are not an especially patient lot and for fans , who scoured social media for the most microscopic of clues \( were those really moving vans outside james s home in miami \? and what was he doing posting a photo on instagram of his old pals from akron , ohio \? \) through it all , though , james remained as impassive as ever on wednesday , he made an appearance here at his annual basketball camp for elite high school players he even shot a few hoops himself before departing for his meeting with riley none of the participants made public comments afterward , letting the suspense build for a while longer while all this was playing out , the were making moves in hopes of persuading james to return they were able to shed about 10 million in player payroll by engineering a threeteam trade that involved the nets and the boston celtics the cavaliers gave up a lot of assets for nothing but salarycap space , enough to produce a contract that would pay james about 207 million next season the most he can earn under league rules it was one of the few deals that could get done , if only because it peripherally involved james it was a huge gamble by cleveland and one that came at a cost the cavaliers agreed to send sergey karasev , a promising forward , to the nets , and to give a future firstround pick to the celtics but that was the price of business with the league s top player on the open market the notion that james might not return to cleveland \? it was not something that fans wanted to consider there s no way he s going to rip our hearts out twice like this , said jason herron , a seasonticket holder and the general manager of an akronarea car dealership herron , 40 , recalled how james left the cavaliers four years ago , with a televised special that reduced cleveland to abject despair herron played a part by using a james jersey to start a bonfire outside a cleveland bar the footage spread quickly online , a symbol of the city s fraught relationship with professional sports and its instant animosity toward james things change , of course herron said he spent sunday on his computer monitoring the flight path of a plane belonging to the cavaliers owner dan gilbert it was 85 degrees , the sun only comes out five times a year in cleveland , and i'm inside watching gilbert s plane go to miami , he said it would be total redemption if lebron came back and total disappointment if he does not by merely taking his time with his decision , and by having his agent , rich paul , meet with the cavaliers last week , james had done enough to inspire hope for his return not that it was his fault , or that he deserved blame james does not owe anyone anything at this stage of his career , not when he has so much to offer it was also worth noting that there were no guarantees in any of this for riley , a man whose championship credentials are nearly unrivaled phil jackson , the one person who might have something to say about that , was in his own bit of a holding pattern wednesday as he awaited word from about whether he would resign with the knicks here were two instances in which the players held all the power , a product of free agency and all the agita it can produce the trickledown effect was enormous consider chris bosh , who was believed to be weighing a lucrative contract offer from the but was waiting to see what james would do consider , for that matter , the rockets , who were most likely drafting several backup plans in case james opted to return to miami and brought bosh back with him james s decision was even affecting the memphis grizzlies , who had offered mike miller a new contract but miller appeared to be waiting on james , a former teammate by the end of the day , the lebron flowchart looked like a maze the situation would probably have been a lot different had the heat beaten the san antonio spurs in the finals to state the obvious , it would have been much more difficult for james to explore leaving miami after winning three straight championships but the spurs exposed the heat s flaws , and james was left to consider his options amid all the uncertainty , the spurs put themselves back in the conversation wednesday if only for a moment the team released a 28word statement announcing that coach gregg popovich had agreed to a multiyear contract extension some things never change

atlanta federal officials said wednesday that they would begin temperature screenings of passengers arriving from west africa at five american airports , beginning with kennedy international in new york as early as this weekend , as the united states races to respond to a deadly ebola outbreak travelers at the four other airports washington dulles international , o'hare international , hartsfieldjackson international and newark liberty international will be screened starting next week , according to federal officials the screenings , which will include taking the passengers' temperatures with a gunlike , noncontact thermometer and requiring them to fill out a questionnaire after deplaning , will be for people arriving from liberia , sierra leone and guinea , the three countries hardest hit by the epidemic about 90 percent of the people arriving from the three countries come through the five airports , officials said kennedy airport alone has about 43 percent of the travelers the secondhighest share of visitors 22 percent come through washington dulles over all , their numbers are relatively small of the roughly 36 , 000 travelers who left the three countries over the past two months , officials said , about a quarter came to the united states of those , 77 had symptoms , such as a fever , consistent with earlystage ebola , but none turned out to have ebola most of the fevers were related to malaria , a disease spread by mosquitoes the airport screenings are the federal government s first largescale attempt at improving the safety at american ports of entry , a measure many had called for after a liberian man was treated for ebola in dallas , the first case of the disease in the united states the man , thomas eric duncan , 42 , died in isolation at texas health presbyterian hospital on wednesday we work to continuously increase the safety of americans , said dr thomas r frieden , the director of the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta we believe these new measures will further protect the health of americans , understanding that nothing we can do will get us to absolute zero risk until we end the ebola epidemic in west africa the cdc will send personnel to airports to perform the screenings , and coast guard members will be deployed to help in the coming weeks the instrument that will be used to take people s temperature uses an infrared beam to take the temperature if someone has a temperature , that person will be further evaluated by a cdc expert in the airports it is the first time that health authorities in the united states have taken the step of monitoring the temperature of people arriving at american airports , and the policy carried broad implications for health departments across the country how to respond to someone with a temperature will be up to local health departments , officials said local health officials may decide to quarantine a traveler , something that is legal under american law , or to transport a traveler to the hospital in texas , health authorities decided to require some of the people who had contact with mr duncan to be monitored by health professionals , because the professionals did not think the people were capable of taking their temperatures themselves health checks in airports have been applied to travelers entering the united states in the past during the sars epidemic , for example but no temperature checks were required travelers were given yellow cards that explained the signs and symptoms of sars and warned them that if the symptoms developed , they should bring the cards to physicians officials are also working to coordinate efforts with countries that receive connecting flights from west africa with united statesbound passengers so that the cdc questionnaire can be distributed internationally , officials said white house officials declined to comment on the new screenings , although in the past several days , administration officials have signaled that they were considering new measures in the united states that would add to the procedures already in place in african countries where the disease is rampant president obama indicated on monday his desire to increase screenings , saying after a briefing with top health officials that the government was already planning a new approach we 're also going to be working on protocols to do additional passenger screening , both at the source and here in the united states , mr obama said there have been calls to ban travel from the affected countries altogether , but senior administration officials said that would be counterproductive , because it would harm the international effort to quell the disease in west africa , where it is raging out of control further spreading of the disease in africa would serve only to increase the risks to americans banning travel would do more harm than good , and paradoxically it would increase the risk to americans , an official said people going in have to come out too the ability to respond to the outbreak would be undermined republican lawmakers have been highly critical of what they say has been a lax and inadequate response by the obama administration , and many have pushed to restrict air travel from west africa the criticism has been most pronounced from conservatives like senator ted cruz , who represents texas and has written to the federal aviation administration asking officials to outline what steps are being taken to keep travelers sick with ebola from boarding flights bound for the united states i remain concerned that we do n't see sufficient seriousness on the part of the federal government about protecting the american public , mr cruz told a texas radio station this week the screenings are a shift in administration policy from last week , when senior white house officials and doctors at the centers for disease control and prevention resisted calls for trying to take passengers' temperature as they entered the united states in an interview last week , dr frieden , the director of the cdc , questioned the wisdom of such an approach , saying that the result would be a great number of false positives from people who had fevers because of illnesses other than ebola he questioned who would be trained to take the temperatures , and he said he worried about where people with temperatures would be held temporarily in the airport like any intervention , there are upsides and downsides , dr frieden said at the time there are a lot of downsides you slow travel , you end up costing people money who s going to get screened \? who s going to train them \? if you have a positive , where are you going to bring them to \? he added the plain truth is we ca n't make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in west africa what we can do is minimize that risk , as is being done now in dallas
the united states recovered thousands of old chemical weapons in from 2004 to 2009 and destroyed almost all of them in secret and via openair detonation , according to a written summary of its activities prepared by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons , the international body that monitors implementation of the global chemical weapons treaty the , prepared after quietly held meetings between the organization s technical staff and american officials in washington in 2009 , was provided to the new york times by the pentagon on friday it included a table disclosing limited details on 95 separate recoveries and destructions of chemical warheads , shells or aviation bombs , for a total of 4 , 530 munitions from may 2004 through february 2009 a period of often intense fighting in iraq the united states later recovered more iraqi chemical weapons , pushing its tally to 4 , 996 by early 2011 , according to obtained by the times via the freedom of information act the weapons destroyed through early 2009 , the newly released report said , included some that contained chemical agents , others that were corroded and degraded , and some that appeared to have been previously demilitarized but that the united states destroyed to err on the side of safety and security its authors noted that none of the weapons had been recently manufactured all were legacy items from iraq s chemical weapons program in the 1980s and early 1990s that program had been rushed into production during the iraniraq war and then destroyed in the 1991 gulf war and the period of united nations inspections that followed all munitions found were left over from pre1991 iraqi program , the report said the report by the organization , which has its headquarters in the hague and is often referred to as an international watchdog on chemical weapons and treaty compliance , was a result of an unusual moment in the american occupation in early 2009 , at american prodding , iraq s fledgling government joined the chemical weapons convention , the international treaty that has largely banned chemical weapons worldwide with that , iraq assumed obligations to declare and ultimately destroy under the organization s supervision any chemical weapons remaining from s rule until that point , american forces had been quietly finding and destroying old chemical weapons in the country at times , the weapons were being used by militants in improvised bombs as american forces took possession of the weapons , the united states government had kept the bulk of these activities and their complications secret , including , especially from sulfur mustard blister agent , sustained by american troops once iraq joined the convention , however , the united states shifted its stance and proposed a more thorough disclosure it invited the organization s specialists to review , in private , records of the military s activities the report , prepared by the organization s technical secretariat , recounted elements of that review , which was held in summer 2009 its authors appeared to choose words carefully , relating information and positions that the american government had shared with them without passing judgment on their contents the report explicitly noted that in many cases the american records were scarce , and that this activity was not a verification measure and was not conducted in accordance with rules contained in the verification annex the part of the treaty that delineates procedures for destroying chemical weapons and confirming compliance the report s purpose , the authors noted , was to allow the us to provide assurance that it acted in the spirit of the convention a spokesman for the organization , reached late friday , said he had not seen the document the pentagon s release of the report was a partial departure from its nearly decadelong posture of secrecy in 2004 , charles a duelfer , who led the iraq survey group , a task force established by the cia after the americanled invasion , published on the state of iraq s weaponsofmassdestruction programs , which included sections describing the american recovery and destruction of a small number of chemical warheads and shells that year an early 2005 addendum updated the information the united states then fell nearly silent as troops encountered more chemical shells , publicly releasing only snippets in 2006 by then , the number of encounters with chemical weapons in improvised bombs had increased soon more troops were wounded by them , as secrecy prevailed the technical secretariat noted , for instance , that even when the united states sent a letter in 2006 to the hague disclosing that it had encountered chemical munitions and expected to encounter more , it guarded the details and asserted that efforts to recover and destroy chemical munitions remained an extremely sensitive matter the contents of the newly released report suggest that there were limits to american informationsharing in 2009 , even with the watchdogs almost no reference is made to people and the list of incidents is not complete it is missing , for instance , the september 2006 recovery of a repurposed mustard shell from an improvised bomb that wounded two navy ordnance disposal techs chief petty officer ted pickett and petty officer third class jeremiah foxwell further , the united states declined to share precise locations for the recoveries of chemical munitions us representatives indicated that the exact locations are considered sensitive , the report said jeffrey lewis , a nonproliferation analyst at the monterey institute of international studies , upon reviewing the newly released document on friday , also said that what the report described of american actions appeared to be unsafe to american troops and iraqis alike the thing i take away from this is , god , they blew all of this up in open pits \? ' he said there is a reason that is arguably incompatible with our treaty obligations there is no universe where this is a safe and ecologically appropriate way to dispose of chemical weapons the pentagon has said the exigencies of war required that the weapons be destroyed hastily and in the open mr lewis said he understood that troops who assumed disposal missions , typically while on missions to counter improvised bombs , lacked the equipment and time to handle chemical weapons more deliberately and with less risk he suggested the pentagon had failed them by being unprepared and careless when you step back to look at the broader responsibilities we have as a country , we rolled into iraq , we had no plan , we were not very focused , and so we stumbled onto this stuff , he said i am totally sympathetic to the guys on the ground who had to deal with this , but i just ca n't get away from the fiasco that put them in this situation in the first place the released documents also included six pages on a similar visit by the organization s technical staff to england , where they reviewed records provided by the british government of a far smaller set of destructions disclosed by british forces 21 borak rockets containing sarin nerve agent in early 2006 the british government , in contrast to the united states government , had in 2010 publicly released details of the borak destructions after iran complained to the watchdog group of the clear violation of the united states and the united kingdom obligations under the convention
my sunday column used ted cruz s nowfamous performance at a summit organized to raise awareness of christian persecution in the age of isis as a window into the difficulties that the middle east s swiftlydisappearing christians have finding patrons in the american political scene the column didn t have space to do justice to the various arguments raised in defense of cruz s provocations the most notable of which was his challenge to a mostlyarab audience to acknowledge that christians have no greater ally than the jewish state , which prompted boos and sent things spiraling downhill so let me say a word about those arguments here the first defense is that the conference in question included some attendees who have had dialogue with hezbollah , some who have sided with the assad regime in syria s civil war , and one \( the patriarch of antioch , the leader of the melkite greek catholic church \) who has floated a vile conspiracy theory about the supposed zionist role in creating al qaeda no matter the gravity of the danger facing christians in the middle east , this argument goes , nobody who cares about either the fate of israel or basic moral decency can afford to overlook such compromising ties and noxious words even in the face of genocide , one cannot \( to quote , one of cruz s more vehement defenders \) be complacent about the mainstreaming of allies of terrorist groups which is exactly what it seems that cruz s critics are asking as i said in the column , i don t think this argument shows quite enough sympathy for the realworld position of middle eastern christians in at least some of the examples in question , i think tobin and others are defining allies of terrorist groups too broadly if you re the maronite patriarch , responsible for the safety of lebanon s christians , and you don t have lines of dialogue open to hezbollah then you re committing a criminal dereliction of duty and imposing litmus tests that would basically exclude many leaders of levantine and mesopotamian christianity from public dialogue even as their communities are being threatened or wiped out and as a general principle , the threat of genocide mass murder extinction has to license a more flexible attitude toward dialogue and alliances with bad actors , and a more understanding attitude toward the threatened people who cut such deals unless we think that the choices that western powers made between 1940 and 1989 were tantamount to endorsements of stalin or mao or various lesser mass murderers , which i assume tobin does not but let s say i did find the argument convincing or let s say \( to zero in the most persuasive version of it , to my mind \) that cruz thought whatever you might say in defense of dialogue with hezbollah ,  that quote from the melkite patriarch is simply too antisemitic , too vile , for me to be associated with in any way for someone who still cared about doing justice to the cause of christians facing extermination , what would be the appropriate response \? one possibility , it seems to me , would be to simply withdraw from the speaking slot , as a few lawmakers apprised \( as we now know that cruz was apprised \) of these issues did let the conference go on , because the larger cause deserves respect , but don t associate yourself personally with some of the attendees by sharing a stage or auditorium with them obviously that wasn t the route cruz chose so here s door number two go to the conference , speak at the conference , but make sure to include in your remarks a critique of antisemitism and jewhatred , and a condemnation of both hezbollah and assad that is , lend your voice to the defense of persecution , but also speak some truth to the assembled on those issues where you want to draw a clear red line cruz did this indeed , he led with this tonight , we are all united in defense of jews religious bigotry is a cancer with many manifestations isis , alqaeda , hezbollah , hamas , and their state sponsors like syria and iran etc and the audience did not boo they applauded those remarks but then he also decided again , in the first two paragraphs of his address , before he d said much of anything about christian persecution to walk through door number three , and lecture the assembled on how they should think about their own situation telling them first to make no distinction whatsoever between isis and other awful actors \( when many middle eastern christians have no choice but to make such distinctions indeed , their very lives depend on it \) , and then telling them that they should regard israel as their great , nonegreater ally in the quest to save their communities and lives which brings us to the second defense of cruz that in making this claim before this audience , he was only speaking the plain truth , because there s no better , safer place to practice the christian faith in the middle east than as a christian citizen of israel , and thus the israeli government deserves to be seen as middle eastern christianity s most important ally this is tobin s argument it s also the argument , developed at greater length , of david harsanyi at the federalist there s only one country in the middle east , he writes , that doesn t persecute or allow the persecution of christians and , in today s world , that makes them an ally of the oppressed except that when you describe a country as an ally of a given people , you re using a term that normally refers to people outside that country s borders , not to that country s own inhabitants in normal usage , israel isn t an ally of its christian citizens , any more than the us is an ally of its muslim or buddhist or amish citizens it s just , well , their government and while the fact that israel treats religious minorities quite well is laudable , wonderful , and illustrative of the jewish state s uniqueintheregion qualities , it s not directly germane to the question of how lebanese christians or syrian christians or palestinian christians or iraqi christians should think about their relationship with the israeli government and those relationships the relationships of most of the people in cruz s audience are of course extremely fraught start with palestinian christians , who \( if they haven t emigrated \) live under israeli occupation , with all that that experience entails one can accept the occupation as necessary to israeli security , surely , without also expecting people who endure it and its impositions on their faith to regard their occupier as their greatest ally then continue to lebanese christians \( probably the largest group at the conference \) , who have allied with israel in various contexts across the decades , with results that \( as harsanyi concedes \) left a lot of bitter feelings among maronite christians indeed , there are many lebanese christians who feel like they have to cut deals with hezbollah today precisely because the israelis abandoned them following its interventions in lebanon s internal conflicts maybe this perception is mistaken or unreasonable , but it still exists , often as a raw wound , in which words like cruz s would necessarily rub salt and to what end \? then beyond the palestinians and lebanese you have christians from iraq and syria and elsewhere , for whom israel and israeli policy are often just irrelevant to their everyday situation not always or inevitably i appreciate seth mandel s intervention on this point , arguing that both the israeli government and israeli citizens have done more for persecuted christians behind the scenes than is often appreciated but if you re a christian in the zone of persecution right now , your immediate sources of help are likely to be kurds or americans , not israelis , and the idea that your leaders need to publicly stand with israel or form some kind of united front against terror is at best a non sequitur , at worst an active danger to your position indeed , that danger exists all over the middle east , not just in iraq and eastern syria as rod dreher notes , christians in countries like egypt are regularly denounced as agents of zionism to whip up persecutions against them , and frequently attacked \( as in the example he cites \) for incautious words uttered when traveling abroad so given that reality , asking persecuted christians to identify as israel s allies and applaud israeli policy is to pile yet another potential peril on their heads a recognition of that point was absent from cruz s rhetoric , and it s absent from the arguments that harsanyi , tobin and others have mounted in his defense it s true , as harsanyi writes , that generally speaking , israel shares the same enemies , the same broader geopolitical aims and the same moral outlook with the region s christians and especially with those christians least compromised by their political choices , and thus most deserving of western respect and support it s also true that the persecution and cleansing of christians is of a piece , ideologically , with the persecution and cleansing of jews that what iraqi christians face today is not unlike what iraqi jews faced in the 1940s , and what israelis would face today if hamas and hezbollah had their way and so yes in the best of all possible worlds , maronite and coptic and assyrian christian would indeed all be standing shoulder to shoulder with israelis \( and moderate muslims \) in the struggle against terror but in this world , most middle eastern christians are in one of the following three positions relative to israel it s an occupying power , at best a lesser evil \( compared to hamas \) but certainly not a benevolent ally by any reasonable definition of the term it s an erstwhile ally which they feel left them after years of loyal cooperation or it s a faroff country with few ways to aid them and which they stand to face a great deal of immediate danger for being associated with in any way combine these positions with the stark reality of ongoing genocide , and i think it should be clear why so many of us think cruz was wrong to address an audience of middle eastern christians as he did because the propositions he was advancing are a description of how an ideal world might be , not of the world they actually inhabit , and because it s unreasonable to ask people whose communities are on the knife s edge of destruction to pay homage to a vision that they either have good historical reasons to dissent from , or feel they cannot endorse for fear of making their own situation worse a final word , since this debate has grown so heated based on what i ve seen from him these last two years , i rather strongly doubt the purity of ted cruz s motivations in this whole affair but like mollie hemingway , whose attempt to step back from the controversy deserves your attention , i don t doubt the motives of most of his defenders , and i completely understand how , in a world where jewhatred seems to be escalating , the importance of drawing the brightest possible lines would trump the need to be understanding of people who boo a politician s praise for israel and at other moments , in situations where the plight of christians was less immediately dire , i might agree with that linedrawing but i would just suggest , to cruz s defenders , that it s the people currently being ground under history s wheel who most deserve the benefit of the doubt , and that litmus tests that are understandable in other contexts need to be applied more flexibly in this one with death knocking at their doors , middle eastern christians don t need to be told who their friends are they need to be shown the kind of understanding that true friendship presently requires
salzburg , austria about a week ago , i was chatting at the salzburg festival with a friend who had seen the german director sveneric bechtolf s recent staging of wagner s ring cycle in vienna i hated it , he said but i ca n't remember why a couple of days after taking in mr bechtolf s version of don giovanni , the continuation of his salzburg trio of the operas mozart wrote with the librettist lorenzo da ponte , i can see what my friend meant superficially chic , vibrant and full of motion , mr bechtolf s production is vague and dull at its core , swiftly fading from memory even as the unpleasant taste it leaves persists the opera is set in an art decoish hotel lobby , not the most original idea still it could easily work , adding a note of transience to a work about transmutability and providing a readymade class hierarchy off which to play but while mr bechtolf s lords and ladies wear stylish clothes , and the maids don uniforms , there s no texture to their relationships , nor the ecosystem they inhabit members of an ambiguously suppressive police force sometimes appear on the margins , moodily lit but no menace enters the atmosphere , particularly not with christoph eschenbach leading the vienna philharmonic with a pace deliberate to the point of lethargy while each of the opera s three main female characters is seduced by the don , each is also unique , with her own personality , objectives , strengths and weaknesses here , the three were interchangeably , blandly dyspeptic played by two richvoiced veterans of their roles , don giovanni \( ildebrando d'arcangelo \) and leporello \( luca pisaroni \) were just as temperamentally indistinguishable if this was a conscious choice a reflection on the flexibility of identity , perhaps it registered only as flat is leporello s catalog aria , sung by mr pisaroni with confident ease , mocking , sympathetic , dejected or proud \? is the don s finch'han dal vino fizzy or ferocious \? all these options are on the table mr d'arcangelo and mr pisaroni were invariably energetic , but to no clear end it seemed like don ottavio \( the firmtoned tenor andrew staples \) would have a more prominent , assertive role than the usual wimp , but our interest in him dissolved during arias that were smoothly sung but lacked energy when mr bechtolf , who takes over the salzburg festival this fall for two years as a kind of interim artistic director , did have an idea , he did n't pursue it his opening scene showed don giovanni spinning donna anna into place to stab her father , the commendatore , adding a smidgen of postfreudian electric charge but then this director and his anna , the slendervoiced soprano lenneke ruiten , failed to play out any of the implications revulsion \? guilt \? secret glee \? none of the above it was a telling failure in a production that was about attitude rather than depth or thought , full of moments that seemed supposedly sexy giovanni , leporello and donna elvira in a threesome masetto and zerlina stripping down to their underwear but ultimately came across as wheel spinning the one moment in which the performance became focused and heated was donna elvira s mi tradi , sung by the soprano anett fritsch with passionate concentration a brief blossoming of her character and an intimation of the stakes this opera should embody throughout but a single aria cannot inflame a listless evening when ms fritsch finished , the woman next to me applauded while checking her watch
sydney , australia secretary of state john kerry warned prime minister nuri kamal almaliki of iraq on monday not to interfere with the process of picking a new iraqi leader , cautioning pointedly that a power grab would lead to a cutoff of international support there should be no use of force , mr kerry said in remarks to reporters in sydney , where he met with australian officials , no introduction of troops or militias into this moment of democracy for iraq we believe that the governmentformation process is critical in terms of sustaining the stability and calm in iraq , and our hope is that mr maliki will not stir those waters mr kerry s comments came amid heightened tensions in baghdad and fears that mr maliki might abuse his authority as commander in chief to extend his rule in a parallel military development , american officials said that the kurds , who have been struggling to defend themselves against sunni militants from the islamic state in iraq and syria , have begun to receive arms from outside sources in recent weeks , kurdish officials have repeatedly asked the obama administration for ammunition , machine guns , mortars , sniper rifles , vehicles and other weapons to battle the sunni militants american officials said that the pentagon was not supplying the arms , suggesting that the program was part of a covert effort that enlisted the support of other countries they are getting some arming from various sources , said a senior state department official , who asked not to be identified because he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues the official declined to provide details on what weapons were being provided or who was providing them the iraqi prime minister , who is , is locked in a test of wills with , fuad masum , a kurd mr masum s powers are largely ceremonial , but he plays an important role in the formation of the iraqi government and enjoys the support of washington and several of iraq s embittered factions on monday in baghdad , mr masum formally nominated a candidate to replace mr maliki , hours after a sunday night speech in which mr maliki complained sharply that the president had not named him as a candidate for another term as prime minister instead , mr masum chose haider alabadi , who is a member of mr maliki s shiite islamist dawa party and  under iraq s constitution , mr abadi now has 30 days in which to form a government with iraq s sunni and kurdish factions mr maliki will remain as a caretaker leader during that time , and as commander in chief of iraq s security forces nerves in the capital have been frayed by reports in the iraqi news media of troop movements that were seen as a sign mr maliki might be digging in for a fight though the obama administration has said publicly it will not get involved in iraq s internal politics , it has been quietly supporting the effort to find an , a shiite politician who originally came to power in 2006 with the united states' blessing in recent years , mr maliki has been criticized for what many call authoritarian tendencies and has been accused of fanning sectarian tensions washington hopes that a new prime minister would be able to form a multisectarian government that would give sunnis a bigger stake in the political system and make them less sympathetic to sunni militants from isis the american consultations about an alternative have involved contacts with an array of politicians , as well as efforts to communicate with the grand ayatollah ali alsistani , a shiite spiritual leader mr kerry , who is in sydney with defense secretary chuck hagel for security talks with australian officials , said that the iraqi people supported a peaceful transition of power and said that there were three or so shiite candidates for prime minister , none of whom are mr maliki he also strongly endorsed mr masum s handling of the situation , saying that the united states was absolutely squarely behind him mr kerry said that the united states would support a new iraqi government but his strongest warning came when he cautioned that an effort by mr maliki to shortcircuit the iraqi constitution would lead to a cutoff of international backing one thing all iraqis need to know , that there will be little international support of any kind whatsoever for anything that deviates from the legitimate constitutional process that is in place and being worked on now , mr kerry said they need to finish that and give a new government an opportunity to be voted on , then move forward mr maliki , for his part , vowed on monday to challenge mr masum s refusal to reappoint him as prime minister i will submit today an official complaint to the federal court against the president of the republic for committing a clear constitutional violation for the sake of political calculations , mr maliki said , according to news reports with political tensions mounting in the capital , police officials were quoted as saying that forces loyal to mr maliki had taken up strategic positions , apparently to forestall any challenge on the streets police officers , some backed by armored vehicles , were said to have put up roadblocks at major intersections and to have closed some roads altogether the senior state department official said that mr maliki appeared to be mounting a last desperate effort to try to force some kind of a deal as his chances for retaining his prime minister post have diminished the state department official said it appeared that shiites were now coalescing around a main alternative shiite candidate to mr maliki , though he added there might be a constitutional hiccup because iraqi politicians may narrowly miss the deadline to make their choice the official said that the united states had not confirmed reports of significant troop movements in baghdad and believed that mr maliki s hopes to retain his post would be frustrated he ai n't going to be prime minister , the state department official said of mr maliki
bolinas , calif two years ago , my mother called let me talk to my granddaughter , she said i handed the baby the phone , and they gurgled at each other when i picked up again she told me that , after 45 years of marriage to my father , she had hired a divorce lawyer this wasn t so much a shock as a deep , glacial shift my father , a doctor , has long battled addiction he is a loving man , hilarious on some days , but frightening on others and my mother loved him , too much to walk away we all did so we lived with the storms and waited them out this resulted less in visible scarring than in a sort of wry emotional stoicism that has become our family stamp but during my mid20s , my daughterly role morphed from protected vessel of innocence to soughtafter confidante from whom nothing nothing ! was withheld i listened as my mother divulged increasingly alarming stories still , it was obvious to me the split would never really happen come on , i thought let s stop kidding ourselves we re all old now then , at the age of 72 , mom reached a threshold as much as she hated to do it , she finally had to free herself there is something decidedly disorienting about becoming a child of divorce at 40 for one thing , my brother and i are extravagantly late to the party during the first wave of divorces among my parents group when i was 8 or 9 , i pined for the family breakup it wasn t that i was terribly miserable \( moderately , maybe \) the real draw was that the attention seemed glamorous today , my daughter s father and i totter after her with snacks and books , catering to her every emotional need this was not the style when i was a kid mom and dad were wonderful parents , yet my brother and i were largely along for the ride on their social train , sometimes getting accidentally mislaid in airports and at house parties it wasn t negligence it was just the way it was for their set in the early 80s to have your mother and father fight for you in court , now that seemed cool and the guilt presents ! as my girlfriends with divorced parents got older , the spoils became more desirable bags of new clothing from esprit tickets to unchaperoned jefferson starship concerts i remember one of my friends receiving a new honda wrapped in a bow and certainly there was nowhere sexier to be in eighth grade than at a sleepover in a friend s divorceddad condo , where the porky s movies looped unchecked , and for breakfast one might be served pizza and warm new coke at 40 , for me my parents separation draws no pity slumber parties , no new cars blank stares are usually what i get when i drop the sad news though it rarely comes up why would it \? there are no arrangements to make to pick me up from dance class , no birthday parties to choreograph what does it mean , when your parents split apart after you yourself have lived half of your life \? for one thing , there isn t a shred of innocence left i know exactly what my mother and father are losing , because i ve known these people for four decades i ve witnessed their stubborn affection for each other i m old enough to get their private jokes if i were younger , perhaps i could trick myself into imagining a cute parent trap situation , but my middleaged mind knows reconciliation is not possible , not after almost half a century of two people struggling with a disease no one beats certainly , i am less shattered than i would have been as a kid but i am sadder , too and then there is the new chill that has permeated my own household i m in a happy relationship that i can t imagine wanting to leave but will the statistics about children of divorce suddenly apply to me , now that i m the product of a broken home \?

seoul , south korea in most countries , footage might have generated some curiosity but in tightly controlled , those images coupled with the disappearance of the country s ruler , , from public view for five weeks have generated endless debate among foreign officials and analysts always on the lookout for upheaval in one of the world s most dangerous police states the disappearance is especially notable because mr kim , like his father and grandfather before him , has used public appearances accompanied by fawning subjects as a key tool of the propaganda machine that has long held the state together for now , american and south korean officials say that while they think the young leader might be ailing , there is no sign that there has been a coup after three generations of kims , any shift away from dynastic rule would probably involve unusual movements of the country s millionplus military or its people , and none have been detected by the south and the fact that north korea sent three officials widely seen as the nos 2 , 3 and 4 in the country s hierarchy to attend the recent closing ceremony of the asian games in south korea , and that during their visit they agreed to with seoul , suggests that mr kim remains in control , according to officials and analysts in south korea in washington , officials have waved off coup rumors as the wishful thinking of people who have spent years looking for signs of regime collapse and been serially disappointed the last time was when everyone was predicting that kim jongun would be pushed aside by his more experienced uncle , said one senior official and look what happened to him that uncle , jang songthaek , 67 , got on his nephew s bad side over business deals and power plays involving some in the elite , and , according to accounts pieced together by american and south korean officials at the time that has spawned rumors that disaffected members of the ruling party or military , eager to settle scores , are at it again , but officials say there is far more speculation of such a plot than evidence but given the secretive nature of the north korean government , and the consequences of turmoil in a nucleararmed and often belligerent country , the official doubts about any power shifts have done little to stop speculation some of the rumors are relatively benign , suggesting that the corpulent mr kim is simply recovering from that nemesis of many a leader with a soft spot for rich food gout but others suggest that mr kim , who is believed to be about 30 , has finally lost power to older north korean power brokers more schooled in the country s treacherous politics , either through a planned revolt or a more subtle takeover that would leave him as a figurehead in an indication of the breathless nature of the online rumor mill , one story circulated on social media in china went so far as to name the engineer of the purported coup , vice marshal jo myongrok the only catch mr jo several years ago one reason for the proliferation of theories is that rumors in north korea have sometimes turned out to be true these include news of the country s in the 1990s as well as the more recent \( and unpopular \) , which in both cases first surfaced in poorly sourced reports but there is also always the temptation to believe the worst of a familyruled country that has little exposure to the outside world and has displayed its share of oddities , and cruelties at least in earshot of their many minders , regular north koreans credit the kims with godlike feats and although experts say mr kim did not as one chinese blog post suggested , south korean intelligence officials said some of the uncle s lieutenants were executed by machine gun in gauging what has happened to mr kim , some analysts have noted that his father and grandfather also disappeared for weeks on end kim jongun s disappearing act over the past month , in the north korean context , is not an aberration , said lee sungyoon , a north korea expert at tufts university s fletcher school of law and diplomacy such vanishing acts would be most unusual in democracies , but in totalitarian north korea , kim is the state he is free to come and go as he pleases mr kim , however , has never been gone from sight this long and , until now , had been notably visible , visiting farms , factories and military units more frequently than his reclusive father did the visits are always covered prominently in the north s statecontrolled news media and include what passes for statecraft in north korea like his father and grandfather , mr kim is followed on the onsite guidance tours by party functionaries and generals about twice his age who furiously scribble down his thoughts on how to make improvements for now , foreign officials and analysts are anxiously waiting for friday , the anniversary of the founding of the ruling workers' party , to see if mr kim will make a public appearance speaking at a parliamentary hearing this week , han minkoo , the south korean defense minister , said that his country s intelligence had determined that mr kim was at a certain place north of pyongyang mr han gave no further details , citing the sensitivity of the intelligence his remark was widely taken as meaning that mr kim was recuperating at a family villa in gangdong , north of the north korean capital , and that the government in seoul did not believe that mr kim had lost power in a coup north korean diplomats in new york and geneva have dismissed reports about mr kim s absence as part of efforts by their country s external enemies to spread disinformation to undermine the pyongyang government one of the three north korean officials visiting the south last saturday , the party secretary kim yanggon , told unification minister ryoo kihljae of south korea that there was no problem at all with kim jongun s health , according to mr ryoo other than mr kim s absence , there are few outward signs of trouble in the north the north korean media is brimming , as usual , with propaganda extolling his leadership on tuesday , the north s main party newspaper , rodong sinmun , intoned that the people and military of north korea knew no other leader than the marshal daily nk , a seoulbased website that says it uses anonymous sources within the north , reported north korean citizens watching the asian games on large screens in central pyongyang in recent weeks while the media there attributed any victory by north korean athletes to the greatness of mr kim most analysts in south korea conclude that mr kim has been kept from the cameras since sept 3 simply because he is suffering from some ailment with so much internal propaganda focused on mr kim , john delury , a north korea expert at yonsei university in seoul , said that if mr kim had surgery and was recuperating , the north would probably not want to release images of him in a wheelchair north korea kept mr kim s father , kim jongil , out of public view for months after he suffered a stroke in 2008 in any case , mr delury said the speculation would not end until the young mr kim appeared in public at some point if kim fails to appear in public , then we can assume there is a serious problem , he said the question is how long \?
chornomorskoye , ukraine russian forces raided a ukrainian naval missile base here in the darkness of early monday , scaling its outer walls and outmatching the surprised sailors inside without firing

approached in civilian clothes , pressed his face against the fence and tried to draw the soldiers into an argument i serve here , he said he made a brief effort to push his way back to his post , but two prorussian civilians grabbed him by the back of his collar and shoved him away the soldiers watched , a few paces away , and chuckled the apparent noncommissioned officer , who led the soldiers on guard duty , refused to answer questions from two journalists no comment , he said he added , we will answer your questions after the referendum russian military forces also surrounded the southern naval base , a ukrainian installation on donuzlav bay , cutting off the troops inside and blocking the konstantin olshansky , an amphibious tank landing ship docked there \( last week , the russians scuttled the ochakov , a decommissioned ship , in the narrow entrance to the bay , effectively preventing the konstantin olshansky from leaving \) the russian soldiers at the base were supported with a backhoe , which they had used to settle in , digging fighting positions and piling a dirt wall around a large canvas tent roughly 15 of the soldiers , armed and wearing masks , refused to answer questions and pushed journalists back toward the main road , walking behind them with weapons ready go away , their leader said in chornomorskoye , the situation was tenser a mix of about 20 local

prorussian , then confiscated their notebooks and tore out any pages with writing on them we will translate these , one of them said , pocketing the pages and handing back the nowblank notebooks they also examined the photographs in digital cards in a photographer s cameras they clustered menacingly around the local man and said , you keep giving interviews and you will end up in prison in sevastopol , the city on the peninsula s southern shore that part of russia s black sea fleet uses as a home port they refused to allow the journalists to leave for about 15 minutes before ordering them to depart the city the russian presence has been felt more heavily throughout crimea as the referendum approaches , with at least five activists and journalists disappearing in the past two days kateryna butko a member of the kievbased opposition group automaidan , as well as two journalists , oleksandra ryazantseva , an independent blogger , and olena maksymenko , a reporter with , were stopped at a checkpoint on the crimean border according to witnesses , the women were detained by masked men with guns and made to kneel at the side of the road , before being driven away to an unknown location on monday , automaidan activists were searching simferopol and sevastopol fruitlessly for the women , who they believe are being held by local security services andrei shchekun and

tallahassee , fla an energetic vibe floated across langford green adjacent to doak campbell stadium baton twirlers practiced their routines , classic rock blared near espn s college gameday set and alumni and students milled about , absorbing the scene and a crisp fall afternoon as the hustle and bustle of florida state s campus kicked into high gear another force , though , has brought together the fsu faithful amid the buildup to saturday night s game between the secondranked seminoles and no 5 the mood and support here have galvanized further behind fsu , even as the university again investigated quarterback jameis winston , this time for whether he received money from sales of his signature on memorabilia shortly after 5 pm friday , florida state announced that an investigation by its compliance staff had not found any evidence of winston s being paid for more than 2 , 000 autographed items that had surfaced on a website at this time , we have no information indicating that he accepted payment for items reported to bear his signature , thereby compromising his athletics eligibility , fsu s athletic director , stan wilcox , said in a statement the fact that items appear on an internet site bearing the signature of a studentathlete does not singularly determine a violation of ncaa rules already under intense scrutiny for its handling of several issues involving winston , including a sexual assault accusation , fsu was forced to address his possible violation of ncaa rules heading into what is seen as the seminoles' toughest remaining game on their regularseason schedule a victory over the fighting irish \( 60 \) would appear to give fsu \( 60 \) a clear path toward a spot in college football s inaugural fourteam playoff and a chance to repeat as national champion the seminoles are also riding a 22game winning streak and , led by winston , they have shown an uncanny ability to remain focused on beating opponents , no matter what happens off the field winston s autograph issues mirror those of georgia running back todd gurley while georgia acted swiftly and immediately suspended gurley , fsu waited on penalizing winston until it completed its investigation coach jimbo fisher passionately defended winston this week , saying , he s never taken a dime for anything thursday after practice , fisher toned down his remarks when asked again about the investigation into winston s autographs that s our compliance and ad , and those guys handle all that stuff , fisher said in reference to the compliance staff and wilcox i'm coaching football asked if he felt there was a bull seye on the program s back , fisher said , anytime you 're successful , people are aware of what you do , but that s part of the territory he added we embrace winning , we embrace being successful that s what we do do things the right way and keep moving forward the autograph situation was the latest in a string of episodes involving winston since he was accused of sexually assaulting an fsu student more than a year ago the tallahassee police department conducted virtually no investigation of the case , as in april , and the prosecutor , left with little evidence to act on , declined to pursue a criminal case in april , winston was cited for shoplifting crab legs from a supermarket in tallahassee , and in september , he was suspended for the seminoles' game against clemson for shouting an obscene phrase in the student union earlier that week he was originally suspended for only the first half , but florida state officials succumbed to pressure and increased the penalty facing criticism for its handling of the sexual assault case , fsu notified winston in a letter dated oct 10 that he was subject to four violations of the student conduct code and that he must eventually appear before a formal hearing the hearing has yet to be scheduled to us , this is just a lot of distraction , said john clune , the lawyer who represents the accuser in the sexual assault case we do n't care about autographs or crab legs or whatever else mr wilson is involved with , he said , adding that the one thing that would not go away was the rape allegation asked about when he anticipated winston s hearing to take place , clune laughed dismissively what hearing \? he said there s going to be some people who are very motivated for this not to happen in the near future it s football season so far , there has not been a sense of urgency on their part winston s lawyer , david cornwell , said in a statement friday that his client had responded to florida state s notice and would cooperate with the codeofconduct procedure , but his legal team would not waive our right to challenge any aspect of this process as , bb gun episodes involving winston and a dozen teammates were among a number of cases at least two more bb gun shootouts , a stolen motor scooter and a domestic violence 911 call in which the tallahassee police appeared to softpedal allegations against florida state football players none of the players were suspended , yet at east carolina , three freshman players were suspended indefinitely in early october after the police cited them for firing bb guns from a car , causing a brief lockdown of a local elementary school at kentucky , four freshmen were suspended for the wildcats' game against south carolina on oct 4 for their involvement in an oncampus shootout , which caused a lockdown of the university s south campus the most recent bb gun episode involved 12 north carolina state players seven have been suspended for saturday s game against louisville and the five others who had been redshirted this season were disciplined earlier this week , some sportsbooks took the florida statenotre dame game off the board when the news broke about winston s autographed memorabilia and a possible suspension loomed but oddsmakers now generally have fsu as an 11 point favorite , a hefty spread for a game between such highly ranked teams so much drama has surrounded the seminoles that notre dame , a program with a large national following , enters the showdown largely off the radar the autograph controversy has tipped sentiment back in favor of winston and fsu , said ira schoffel , the managing editor of the website and a former sports editor of the tallahassee democrat in a weird way , it s actually gotten fans wanting people to either back off , or find something for real they feel like right now a lot of it is just smoke and not seeing the fire schoffel said he was seeing and hearing support for winston start to erode while talking to fans and monitoring message boards and twitter , especially after winston s theft of crab legs and yelling of an obscene phrase i'm sure some still have n't come back , they roll their eyes and think there s more trouble and there s always going to be trouble with jameis , schoffel said but a lot more than i saw after the crab leg situation are very frustrated and feel like show more proof or leave him alone as if to say , leave our quarterback alone , a blamejameis hashtag has popped up on twitter as a parody of winston causing everything from the sinking of the titanic to bent iphones i 've seen it so much here at florida state it s like when you pick on one of us , you pick on all of us , said jordan gray , a junior who works as a bartender at a restaurant near doak campbell stadium i get so tired of espn talking about it people forget he s a college kid like the rest of us let him play football
of the many things being said about climate change lately , none was more eloquent than the point made by gov jay inslee of washington state in the showtime series , when he observed we 're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it the question is do we motivate people to do something about it at the scale required , when many remain skeptical or preoccupied with the demands of daily life and when climate scientists themselves caution that it is impossible to attribute any single weather event to climate change , even if recent weather extremes fit their models of exactly how things will play out as the planet warms andrew sullivan s dish blog last week linked to a very novel approach offered by thomas wells , a dutch philosopher since climate change and environmental degradation pit the present against the future , our generation versus those unborn , we should start by giving the future a voice in our present politics even if we ca n't know what future citizens will actually value and believe in , we can still consider their , on the reasonable assumption that they will somewhat resemble our own \( everybody needs breathable air , for example \) , since our ethical values point one way , towards intergenerational responsibility , but our political system points another , towards the shortterm horizon of the next election , we should consider introducing agents who can vote in a farseeing and impartial way wells suggests creating a public trusteeship of nongovernmental civic and charitable foundations , environmental groups and nonpartisan think tanks and give them each equal shares of a block of votes adding up to , say , 10 percent of the electorate , so they can represent issues like decarbonizing the economy and guaranteeing pension entitlements for the unborn generation that will be deeply impacted but has no vote unrealistic , i know , but the need to incorporate longer time scales into our societal choices is very real and right in the lap of our generation andy revkin , , put it well we are coming of age on a finite planet and only just now recognizing that it is finite so how we manage infinite aspirations of a species that s been on this explosive trajectory , not just of population growth but of consumptive appetite how can we make a transition to a stabilized and still prosperous relationship with the earth and each other is the story of our time one way to get us to act with an intergenerational perspective is to enlarge the problem beyond climate to make people understand that this is our generation s freedom struggle the abiding strategy of our parents' generation was containment of communism in order to be free the abiding strategy of our generation has to be resilience we will only be free to live the lives we want if we make our cities , country and planet more resilient even if we ca n't attribute any particular storm to climate change , by continually pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we are loading the dice in ways that climate scientists are convinced will continue to raise average temperatures , melt more ice , raise sea levels , warm oceans and make normal droughts drier , heat waves hotter , rainstorms more violent and the most disruptive storms even more disruptive it is crazy to keep loading those dice and making ourselves more vulnerable to disruptions that will make us less free to live the lives we want how free will we be when paying the exorbitant cleanup costs of endless weather extremes \? moreover , acting today as if climate change requires an urgent response like replacing income and corporate taxes with a carbon tax , introducing a national renewable portfolio standard to constantly stimulate more renewable energy and raising the efficiency standards for every home , building and vehicle actually makes us healthier , more prosperous and more resilient , even if climate change turns out to be overblown we would end up with cleaner air and a tax structure that rewards more of what we want \( work and investment \) and disincentivizes what we do n't want \( carbon pollution \) we would be taking money away from the worst enemies of freedom on the planet , the world s petrodictators and we would be incentivizing our industries to take the lead in manufacturing clean air , water and power systems , which will be in huge demand on a planet going from 7 billion to 9 billion people by 2050 in short , by taking the climate threat seriously now , we 'd make ourselves so much more economically , physically , environmentally and geopolitically resilient and , therefore , more free what containment was for our parents' generation their strategy to fight for freedom against the biggest threat of their day resiliency will be for our generation against the multiple threats of our day climate change , petrodictatorship and destruction of our environment and biodiversity let s act so the next generation will want to honor us with a memorial day , the way we honor the sacrifice of previous generations
wellington , new zealand ben ryan knew he was taking a step into the unknown when he signed up as the fiji rugby sevens coach last september what the 42yearold from london probably did n't expect , however , was having to pay his own way for the first few months of his contract but ryan , who ended a sixyear stint as england sevens coach last year to sign up for a new life with his wife natalie in the south pacific islands , had to do just that because the cashstrapped fiji rugby union could n't pay his wages i did n't get paid for four months , ryan said once i signed up i could see that the funding was n't there there was no point in my kicking up a fuss i 'd agreed to something , and i was going to keep to my word but in january , the union received a grant from the fiji national sports commission to cover ryan s 160 , 000 salary for 2014 , and he is now being paid a lack of financial resources is nothing new for the fru , which operates on a shoestring budget compared with the millions of dollars spent annually by the likes of rugby powerhouses new zealand , england , south africa , france and australia increasingly , other secondtier countries like the united states are devoting more money to the sport , too fiji , on the other hand , had vital funding from rugby s governing body suspended in january because of concerns about the financial management and governance of the fru losing that 175 million from the international rugby board brought immediate consequences among those who lost their jobs was the national rugby union coach , inoke male ryan and his sevens players did not escape the impact , which hit just before the team traveled to tournaments in las vegas and wellington we did n't have any resources at home for the basics of running things , like bottled water , petrol to get us to training , rugby balls or any expenses for the players , ryan said staff were let go as well all this is in stark contrast to the facilities , resources and help that ryan had at his fingertips during his six years with england there he had nutritionists , physiotherapists , sports psychologists , strength and conditioning coaches , analysts , managers , assistant managers , performance directors and hightech training aids , like gps tracking devices in fiji it s me , he said i'm in charge of the whole program i 've got a physio and a manager despite a lack of resources , fiji has traditionally had a strong sevens team it won the irb world series title in 200506 and since then has placed second over all three times , and fourth over all three times last season it finished third so there is no doubt ryan has the talent with which to work , but he is starting from scratch with the players when it comes to teaching them the value of good nutrition and diet they are also unfamiliar with some of the training and preparation techniques that are second nature in more developed nations but ryan is embracing the challenge it s reminded me that sport at the highest level is still all about the basics , he said all the whistles and horns you get at the top end in some of the more developed nations with your monitoring systems and your hightech gadgets and the various other things , you 've still got to pass the ball and make your tackles that does n't change even with all the offfield issues , the fiji sevens team remains competitive in the 201314 series it won the tournament in tokyo last weekend to add to its triumph in dubai earlier in the series it is third in the standings , behind south africa and new zealand teams that fiji beat in japan and ahead of england , with the sport s showpiece tournament in hong kong starting on friday while it is unlikely fiji will overtake either new zealand or south africa in the series this year , a thirdplace finish in ryan s first year in charge of what is a largely inexperienced group of players would be a good result finishing in the top four in the 201415 series is imperative for fiji sevens is joining the olympics lineup in 2016 , and the top four teams next season will automatically qualify for the games in rio de janeiro brazil qualifies automatically for the 12team competition as host , while the remainder will have to qualify through irb regional tournaments but ryan knows talent and a natural attacking flair will only get his team so far if we want to be a strong contender for top four , then we need resources , he said we need contracts we are the only team in this tournament that have n't got players under contract we are batting well above our average at the moment , when you think about it none of the boys get paid and they 've all got jobs and to win gold in rio \? what we 're never going to do is go toetotoe on a financial footing , ryan said but we will have this unpredictability , which will work in a oneoff tournament like an olympic games very well if we get that right but to get the resources needed to fulfill an olympic dream , the fru is going to have to make peace with the irb it will need to agree to key changes in the financial area , administration and governance for funding to be reinstated in the longer term it is imperative that the irb and the fiji rugby union have an excellent working relationship , ryan said so whatever issues have been going on need to be resolved because the irb are the governing body they also help with funding to develop the game in the islands , and in fiji it s hugely important that that continues at the same time , fiji need to make sure they have their voice in world rugby it is a sentiment echoed by will glenwright , the irb s regional general manager of oceania we are absolutely determined to work with the fiji rugby union to implement these reforms , he said we invest a lot of money in fiji , and fiji has contributed hugely to the growth of the game globally in both sevens and 15s we recognize that our interest is in ensuring that the fiji rugby union remains a sustainable organization that can continue to foster the growth of the game in fiji and around the world we need fiji rugby to be successful , glenwright continued but that said , there are major problems with the administration and governance of the union and they need to be resolved , and that s what we want to work with the fiji rugby union to address financial issues or not , there is pressure on fiji s foreign coach to deliver sevens rugby is fiji s national game from children in the poorest villages throwing around plastic bottles filled with sand in pickup games to more organized matches in local tournaments , sevens rugby is a wellestablished part of life , and the fiji sevens team garners huge public interest and media attention but ryan , who already stands out in fiji with his fair skin and red hair , is taking it all in stride as he and his wife become fully immersed in island life myself and natalie , we struggle to go into suva to have a cup of tea because we just get swamped , he said hundreds of people a day i'm having photographs with , and everyone comes with a conversation about you better win the next tournament' they do n't care if we have n't got any money or if we 're playing teams that are fully professional and working day to day together and have planned and plotted to beat us for years while we 're scrambling a team together , ryan said it makes no difference to the fijian public it s refreshing i do n't know why , but i do n't feel the pressure
moscow after almost a decade without any toplevel women s figure skaters , russia suddenly has more than it can use discovered in distant provinces and aging rinks , trained by the country s leading coaches and eyeing one another s every move , the skaters have a surprising leader in julia lipnitskaia , the newly crowned european champion only 15 , lipnitskaia is two years younger than her olympic teammate , adelina sotnikova , and much younger than the top medal contenders over the past year , lipnitskaia and sotnikova emerged from an intense competition for the two places on russia s olympic team from a talent pool that includes elizaveta tuktamysheva , 17 , and two more 15yearolds , anna pogorilaya and elena radionova and while the pressure is intense on all russian athletes to succeed in sochi , the skaters' rapid rise has some observers contemplating one prize the country has never won at the olympics a gold medal in women s singles there were two , then three , and now there s already really a lot of competitors , and so russian figure skating is blossoming , said tuktamysheva , rolling through moscow on a bus after a training session in order to be selected , you need to be able to do the more complicated moves , and so that was a sort of stimulus from the very beginning sotnikova , who won russia s national championship at age 12 , said it s competitive at every stage all the girls watch each other the exceptional competition for places has raised the level of all the skaters , giving russia a good chance for an olympic medal although not expected to beat the favorites , south korea s kim yuna and japan s mao asada , who are both 24 , the young russians are strong contenders for at least a bronze russia has won only two medals in the event at the games , and never the gold i think lipnitskaia could be the surprise of the olympics , said tara lipinski , the american who won the gold medal at age 15 in the 1998 games in nagano , japan lipinski said that she saw a bit of herself in all five of the young russian skaters they all have the goods , she added it s just who is also the competitor and has the mindset for it the team of prodigies began to attract notice during the 201011 season , as podiums at international junior competitions suddenly started filling with russian skaters since then , a russian has won or placed second in every major international junior final now the russians are breaking through at the senior level , with sotnikova , lipnitskaia and tuktamysheva winning medals in their debuts at the senior european championships lipnitskaia s gold at the event in hungary in january was russia s first in the women s competition since irina slutskaya won the last of her seven titles , in 2006 such a large number of elite skaters is all the more remarkable because russian skating had seemingly been in crisis since 2010 , when the country left the vancouver olympics without a gold medal until last year we did n't have anybody , slutskaya said in a telephone interview but now we have all these young girls slutskaya is russia s most successful female skater , the winner of 40 gold medals in major competitions and the only russian woman to win medals at the olympics , with a silver in 2002 and a bronze in 2006 since her retirement in 2006 , the country has been without a top singles contender we did n't have diamonds before , slutskaya said now we have some until six months ago , few would have predicted that lipnitskaia would go to sochi , much less as a medal contender russian hopes had been fixed on sotnikova , who improved noticeably during the latter part of the grand prix season trained since she was 8 at moscow s cska skating school , sotnikova was picked out for sochi early on , working under one of russia s most acclaimed coaches , her routines choreographed by a former bolshoi ballerina taller and more powerful than lipnitskaia , sotnikova has moves that are generally more finished than the other skaters' she s starting to be like a real professional , slutskaya said she s grown up for the past two seasons , sotnikova s chief rival had been tuktamysheva darkhaired and with hooded eyes , tuktamysheva radiates a peculiar calm , smiling faintly before her routines born in glazov , a city more than 700 miles from moscow and known for uranium production , she used to make a twoday journey to st petersburg every three weeks to train under a veteran coach , alexei mishin when asked what she liked about skating , she smiled simply and said , to jump mishin , 72 , was more emphatic she jumps like a military torpedo , he said tuktamysheva s chances for sochi were derailed this year as her body matured and she lost some of the prepubescent straightness that allows skaters to complete complex jumps flawlessly the timing of the olympics also did not fall right for radionova , the youngest of the new generation she turned 15 in january , outside the minimum age requirement to compete at sochi so many russians being in contention for medals would have been unimaginable until recently when the soviet union collapsed in the early 1990s , its sports training system disintegrated as state financing dried up that left rinks to rot and prompted many of the most experienced coaches to seek work abroad at the same time , the pool of amateur skaters shrank as parents , struggling to stay afloat financially amid economic chaos , stopped sending their children to train russia s prominence in figure skating started to slip as the last of the skaters who had trained under the soviet system retired , none stepped forward to take their place the fallow period is over a more stable economy has allowed parents to send their children to skate again many new municipal rinks have been opened in the past five years most were intended for hockey teams , but they are also available to figure skaters stipends provided by the russian federation are now enough to support skaters and their families people started taking their children to classes again , said tatiana flade , a veteran skating commentator , who has watched the russian girls grow up and there was just a bigger base it s easier to find talented skaters now , and they are pushing each other unlike so much with the sochi games , the rise of the teenage skaters is not the result of a kremlin decree despite diverting huge resources to the construction of the olympic facilities and to more popular sports like hockey , the russian government turned its attention to figure skating only recently a number of the russian girls' coaches said that money had begun to flow significantly into the sport only in the past year and a half instead , the process has been more organic in 2008 , coaches began to seek out girls independently mishin , who has trained four men s gold medalists the most recent was evgeni plushenko , in 2006 began traveling to russia s provinces , visiting distant rinks sotnikova s trainer , elena g vodorezova , a former child champion and another institution of russian skating , established a new team at the cska olympic sports complex radionova and her trainer , inna goncharenko , joined her there at the beginning we were n't thinking about the olympics , vodorezova said we just had this girl , who it was interesting for me to work with , who embodied all my ideas , who i wanted to have beautiful women s skating a new generation of lesserknown coaches also emerged , training girls from a young age to establish themselves lipnitskaia s trainer , eteri g tutberidze , 40 , is among that group one of the skaters who emigrated during the 1990s , tutberidze returned to moscow in 1998 after four years of skating and training in the united states perceived as an outsider , tutberidze struggled initially , but she has created a group of skaters who are among the best in the country the creation of russia s olympic skating team is not a collaborative effort the girls train at separate rinks , and the coaches can be ruthlessly competitive just before she found lipnitskaia , tutberidze said , mishin poached virtually her entire squad they took a whole generation from me , she said , though she admitted , maybe i 'd have done the same thing in that situation the large number of girls has itself pushed up the level of russian skating , and the greater competition has pushed the skaters to excel individually although the girls are cordial toward one another , they are not close friends since each works with a different trainer , there is little sense of team spirit i think a rivalry is always needed , lipinski said i had one with michelle kwan , and i did n't slack off one day because i knew she was practicing hard somewhere and i think these girls see that , and i think they know that someone could take their place in an instant and so they have to be better lipnitskaia seems to have thrived the most on the competition childishly small but with heavily muscled shoulders , she is different from the other girls , more intense in conversation , worried about even a few minutes lost in training her drive to be the best is probably best summed up by her mother , daniela , who sat in the basement of a rink last month and shrugged , saying , you can teach a bear to dance on ice if you train a lot while tuktamysheva and radionova prefer hightempo , flamencostyle backing tracks , lipnitskaia s signature piece is skated to john williams s score from schindler s list since lipnitskaia s triumph at skate canada in september , her confidence has grown with each victory she won two more events and was a close second at the russian nationals before capturing the european title in budapest i changed in that my skating has changed , she said days before the russian nationals it s got more mature , in my head , in my thoughts her strength has been her technique and her elasticity when she spins she becomes a perfectly upright top , her face vanishing into a blur but she had been criticized for a lack of expression that changed in budapest she set herself an adult s task as a child , tutberidze , her trainer , said that s why she seems closed in sochi , lipnitskaia will face skaters who are much older , and most experts say she may need her competitors to make a mistake if she is to win the silver or better but she will not be content with that in november , lipnitskaia won the moscow event of the international grand prix , beating the world champion , carolina kostner of italy afterward , lipnitskaia was distraught she had botched two jumps in her win i thought that was a sign , lipinski said of the reaction i'm like , you are a little olympic champion'

the needle penetrated my latex glove and slipped into the soft skin of my finger it was quick and painless i was in the animal lab of children s hospital los angeles , buried under sunset boulevard despite the thousands of mice within , the lab was peaceful i was alone in front of me , in a vented , pressurized hood , lay a small white sleeping mouse it wore a tiny plastic mask around its nose , which pumped in anesthetic but the drug wasn t working well enough i was about to inject the mouse with an unusually aggressive strain of hiv , taken from the spinal fluid of a young man who succumbed quickly to aids and made more deadly in the lab , when the mouse suddenly jerked i stuck myself with the needle instead this was six years ago , the third year of my doctoral studies i hadn t lived in southern california long los angeles didn t feel like my city it still belonged to my mom four years earlier , only a few miles away from the lab , my mom had killed herself when the mother you love decides to leave you , in the most final way a person can , it changes you forever she didn t have to die but she did a suicide turns you into a meticulous researcher i have spent hours , weeks , perhaps months of my life repeating the exact words of our last phone conversation i have agonized over her final days , analyzed her receipts , reenacted her last meal , worn her jewelry and even emailed her high school boyfriend few other deaths can lead family members to this level of detailed personal research every book will tell you you can never know why but the only thing that s important is understanding why the path is a circle after my research i came to a definite conclusion i was a terrible person i was responsible for my mother s death there seemed to be only one solution become a scientist like millions of sinners before me , i chose redemption science offers the promise of reason it answers the question that haunted me every day why \? i had always loved biology but wasn t so sure about graduate school with my mom s death i was suddenly alone in the world and desperate to make amends it was this semidelusional state that led me to the phd program , made me fall in love with molecular biology , and ultimately put an hivlaced needle in my hand i looked at the little mouse in front of me how could i have done something so foolish \? no one was supposed to do this risky procedure alone i knew what i was supposed to do next i had written the safety procedure myself i should call for help and then begin washing the wound , taking my time to prevent infection but what about the mouse , and its littermates still waiting in their cage \? they were all under anesthetic , and if i left their masks on for too long , they would die most accidental needle sticks occurring in a hospital don t result in an infection but inside the needle that stuck my finger was a highly concentrated virus designed to overwhelm and take over the body i needed antiviral therapy immediately , within the hour , to reduce my chance of being infected and yet i did nothing instead , i returned to the procedure i prepared another needle , gave the mouse the deadly dose and stopped the anesthesia tenderly , i placed the mouse back in its cage , then watched to make sure the drug wore off only after repeating the procedure with each mouse and cleaning the work station did i allow myself to break down i washed my shaking hands for 15 minutes , the minutes seemingly stretching into eternity as i scrubbed the iodine soap into the tiny wound , a few tears fell on my cheeks i willed myself to stop , to be calm and then , before the hour was up , i walked into my academic adviser s office and told her what had happened after a month of antiretroviral medication , i found i was lucky i didn t get hiv the mice were not so lucky as steinbeck wrote , trouble with mice is you always kill em except in science you don t say kill you say sacrifice usually it s abbreviated to sac as in i sac d the mice i had loved those mice , cared for them from birth to death but i had also injected them with millions of human stem cells , and then with a virus that had killed an estimated 36 million humans when i sacrificed them it made way for a new way of treating hiv that strategy , using a gene therapy to cure the disease , is now being pursued in human clinical trials perhaps it will someday be worth it and the brief , brutish lives of those mice will save many humans whether you re speaking of mice or mothers , when you love someone you want to understand their death there needs to be a reason i will never know why my mom had to die perhaps that s why i tried to give meaning to the lives of those mice i just hope that they didn t suffer i hope none of us do is the author of cured how the berlin patients defeated hiv and forever changed medical science
london the journalist is a stranger who moves in the opposite direction from the crowd , toward danger , leaving the settled majority perplexed why , they ask , are you going over the lines \? why do you choose such a lonely existence \? in search of a fair understanding , you say , and they shake their heads there is nothing to understand , they insist , just write the truth ! but truths are many and that is the problem memory is treacherous , as distinct from history as emotion from form every war is fought over memory violent nationalism is revived memory manipulated as revealed truth conflict is incubated in the contested truths the past bequeaths questions swirl who came first to the land , who planted the millennial olive trees , who killed whom first , whether the church predates the mosque , and what of the synagogue that may precede them both \? identities are assembled piece by piece each drop of blood shed , each shrapnel scar on a wall , is annotated in the book of unforgiving in the balkans and the middle east the events of a thousand years past can seem as vivid as yesterday s the enemy imperatives of serb and kosovar , of arab and jew , can demand that memory , like the fuse for a bomb , be shaped for maximum explosive effect truces last no longer than a cheap umbrella in a storm i first came face to face with the power of myth to generate war in the balkans , at kosovo polje , or the field of blackbirds , where the serbs were routed by the ottoman turks in 1389 the battle has since become the lodestone of serbian nationalism , a defeat transformed into a symbol of serbian heroism and selfless sacrifice here , a quartercentury ago , as the cold war order in europe cracked , the serbian nationalist leader , slobodan milosevic , declared for six centuries now , the heroism of kosovo has inspired our creativity , fed our pride , and not allowed us to forget that once we were an army great , brave and proud , one of the few that in defeat stayed undefeated six centuries later , today , we are again in battles and facing battles they are not armed , although such battles cannot be excluded yet the rest is now history a decade of war the dismemberment of yugoslavia the ethnic cleansing of wide swathes of bosnia as its muslims \( often called turks by the marauding serbs \) were processed through serb concentration camps more than 100 , 000 dead sarajevo and srebrenica the nato intervention in kosovo and the contentious emergence of several newly independent european states , the last of them kosovo in 2008 for serbia , the adrenaline of nationalist frenzy turned into the slow drip of loss , none more painful than kosovo , whose overwhelming majority is albanian but whose landscape is dotted with sites sacred to serbs so , after all this , i had to rub my eyes at the munich security conference , where the most extraordinary sight was that of ivica dacic , the serbian prime minister , and hashim thaci , the prime minister of kosovo , sitting together on the same stage , all smiles , talking about how they had reconciled and how , in the words of thaci , the greatest single difficulty was to liberate ourselves from the past israelis and palestinians , take note between the two balkan leaders sat catherine ashton , the european union s foreign policy chief and the world s most underrated diplomat her appointment in 2009 and the creation of the european external action service were much derided but her successful mediation of serbkosovar talks that began in 2011 and her contribution to securing an interim nuclear deal with iran constitute major achievements in the balkans the pull factor of the european union its magnetic attraction to nations craving stability and freedom has again been demonstrated serbia and kosovo had to sort out their differences to stand a chance of getting in , and so they have the maligned european union is still a peacemaking machine normalization was not easy dacic was born in kosovo his people s feelings about the cradle of their civilization are passionate he put the issue bluntly serbia believes kosovo is part of serbia kosovo does not kosovo is 90 percent albanian the serbian economy has languished who can be in favor of such policies \? it is up to us to decide if we move forward or stick to the past serbs and kosovars have decided they found an agreed degree of autonomy for the tens of thousands of serbs in northern kosovo they opened for trade they held free elections they circumvented outstanding differences they put themselves on the road to the european union above all they set aside the potent symbolism of the field of blackbirds in favor of progress , discarded myth to discover commerce , and reasoned their way out of the prison of passionate certainties and revealed truth
london breathing hard , the royal ballet dancers lined up onstage here to take their bows after the premiere of david dawson s new piece last season out came the ushers bearing armfuls of flowers from the company then , to the shock of insiders and disapproval of traditionalists , bouquets were handed to the men as well as the women longsuffering balletomanes reeled back in their seats twitter was abuzz at the royal ballet , the great home of the floral tradition in dance , men do n't get flowers onstage \( unless they are in drag which happens fairly often \) it s one of the many customs , rules and subtle ordinances that govern the art of the bouquet in london flowers matter how many , what kind , who they are given by , who they are given to , how they are bestowed , how they are received \( to present those openingnight bouquets to the men , mr dawson had to get a special dispensation from kevin o'hare , the royal ballet s director \) flowers matter in new york , too , where splendid bouquets will be handed out during nutcracker season \( s version opens nov 28 at the david h koch theater , and american ballet theater s production arrives at the brooklyn academy of music on dec 12 \) but what can seem a simple gesture of appreciation is in fact a highly codified practice , with different ballet companies obeying different rules and traditions at city ballet and ballet theater performances , flowers are generally given by the company on opening nights and for role debuts at the royal opera house , however , there are flowers delivered onstage at almost every ballet performance , most provided by loyal fans who can spend hundreds of dollars each month to keep their favorite ballerinas supplied with floral tributes london is where the art of the bouquet has been perfected , said mark welford , who with stephen wicks runs bloomsbury flowers , a florist a short dash from the royal opera house they supply at least six bouquets a week when the royal ballet performs \( it runs fairly continuously from late september to early july \) for the opening night of in september , they filled several orders for marianela n ez in the title role of manon with manon , ' i usually tie a diamond bracelet which figures prominently in the ballet into the bouquet , although not a real one sadly , said mr wicks , standing recently with mr welford amid buckets of blooms in the back of his shop people often ask for themed bouquets with , ' we did arrangements with sausages , with flamingos , with playing cards and wooden spoons for the sugar plum fairy in nutcracker , ' we do pinks and sweets for la fille mal gard e , ' we weave in a pink ribbon sometimes the fans have great ideas lee mclernon , a london lawyer who sends about 10 to 12 bouquets a season , many from bloomsbury flowers , said that he felt it was a small way to show appreciation for the joy he derives from the dancers it clicked with me that if i want to be sure a dancer i like is getting a bouquet , someone has to provide it , mr mclernon said in a telephone interview mr welford said that he believed that the flowergiving tradition dated back to the early days of british ballet in the 1930s dancers were really badly paid then , and people sent flowers and food and gifts , said mr welford , who , like mr wicks , was a member of the sadler s wells royal ballet \( now the birmingham royal ballet \) in the 1970s and '80s later , ballerinas were more of a fur coat and diamonds phenomenon , he said there was an aura and allure that went with clutching a bouquet of flowers , and something about that has remained at the opera house the floral tradition at the royal ballet is also probably a result of the opera house s proximity to the covent garden flower market before it moved and the possibility of buying leftover or spoiled flowers cheaply back in the day , the fans used to queue overnight for tickets , and there was a very striking woman , dressed in a black velvet cloak , who used to run the queue , collect money for flowers and organize throws from the amphitheater , mr welford said , referring to the tradition of pelting dancers with loose flowers from the topmost part of the theater so what s it like to get hit by streams of flowers coming at you from four stories up \? pretty scary , but kind of lovely , said leanne benjamin , a former royal ballet principal who retired \( amid showers of blooms \) last year but my gratitude was mixed with worry about what would happen to them would they go into a vase \? in margot fonteyn s autobiography , she tells of a moment during a royal ballet visit to russia , when she was struck in the chest by a remarkably solid and heavy water lily after performing ondine it was an appropriate flower , fonteyn writes with a certain sangfroid , but i wished they would stick to daisies and cornflowers fonteyn also recounts a frontrow enthusiast found he could lob his little bunches of flowers over the orchestra pit more successfully if they were weighted i had to keep a very wary eye on his missiles as i was bowing and smiling graciously in front of the curtain it could have been worse the ballet theater dancer julie kent recalled an admirer who would throw huge bunches of longstemmed roses onstage in the middle of a ballet he would rush forward to the bottom of the stalls and fling it , she said in a telephone interview even if i was in something with other dancers , which was sort of stressful some fans have better aim and timing in the 1970s , there was a royal opera house balletomane who would painstakingly prepare individual nosegays he had an absolutely perfect lob , and after ashton s birthday offering , which has seven ballerinas , he would throw these little lacesurrounded bouquets at them , and they would land precisely at the feet of each dancer in the great tradition of throwing tributes at dancers , flowers have n't been the only projectiles in 1734 , the ballerina marie sall caused such a sensation in london that fans threw gold sovereigns wrapped in bank notes and colum mccann notes in the novel dancer , based on rudolf nureyev s life , that in nureyev s first season in paris , a mink coat , erotic polaroids with the names and numbers of the women pictured , and 18 pairs of women s underwear among many other things were flung onstage if anything like this still happens , no one seems to be admitting it it may seem easy to call up a florist , or fashion your own small bouquet and practice your lob , but the protocol of giving flowers is n't that simple until 1997 , when the royal opera house closed for renovation , bouquets were brought onstage by two men dressed in white wigs , knickerbockers and much gold braid known as flunkeys , they would walk on to the stage with stately ceremony , bow to the dancers , offer the flowers , step back , bow again and walk off with the same choreographed deliberation the royal opera house still employs someone to present the flowers , even if he men are preferred for the bouquet bestowing now wears a rather nondescript outfit and is bereft of a wig \( the current bouquet presenter is an opera singer trainee \) while the company policy is to give flowers to the principal female dancers on opening night , bouquets arrive at almost every performance , said johanna adams farley , the senior stage manager for the royal ballet sometimes it can be a little delicate , ms farley said if flowers have arrived for a corps de ballet dancer or soloist , but the ballerina has n't received any , we wo n't present them onstage she added that not every offering makes the cut a bouquet has to be a decent size , she said firmly if something arrives that is too small , we 'll just send it to the dressing room the bouquets must also be constructed in such a way that they are easy for a dancer to hold as she curtsies during curtain calls it s much more difficult to make than you imagine and i 've tried , said deborah koolish , the personal assistant to peter martins , the ballet master in chief of city ballet it has to have a kind of architectural integrity to it i went through several years of auditioning florists then ms koolish got technical the flowers have to be laid down and interwoven in such a way that they hold together and make an oblong shape so that the dancer can hold it in one arm it must be flat on the bottom so that it can rest on the woman s arm , and you have to have long enough stems , because they get shorter as they are graded down the way it is tied with wire , then ribbons over so that it stays together is complex , too and all florists want to put cellophane over , which i ca n't bear when i see flowers go out with cellophane on , i go quietly to pieces in my seat ms koolish said that flowers were not often given in balanchine s day , but that the company now always gives bouquets to the ballerinas at premieres and galas mr b did have one hard and fast rule , which we hold to this day , she said if there is more than one ballerina , either all get flowers , or none at ballet theater , the troupe s production stage manager , danielle ventimiglia said , the dancers tend to get bouquets from fans during the spring season at the metropolitan opera house at the met , there is a team of men who prep the flowers , she said you have to pull the thorns off the roses , make sure that there is no stamen that will dye the costumes we doctor it a little , make sure there is a pull flower for the lady ms ventimiglia was referring to a moment that is now almost standard in the curtaincall ritual , whereby after receiving her bouquet , the ballerina pulls out one flower , kisses it and presents it to her partner \( city ballet ballerinas do n't do that , ms koolish said dismissively \) i do n't know how that started , but it was n't common at the start of my career , said ms kent , who will retire next year i feel like it s become a bit of a rote gesture , so if i really feel moved , i offer my partner my whole bouquet luckily , they usually do n't take it then , of course , there are the occupational hazards of being besieged with bouquets ms benjamin recalled spending a night in the emergency room after almost cutting off a finger while trying to arrange the flowers she had been given after her last juliet alessandra ferri remembered trying not to trip over slippery mounds of blooms at the met after with ballet theater in 2007 you do n't want to exit your career on a silly fall , she said what such occasions need are the ugly sisters after a performance of cinderella in the 1980s at the royal opera house , the stage was strewn with industrial quantities of daffodils on marched derek rencher and michael coleman as the ugly sisters , with a twofootwide broom , and swept them all away
when you make six errors in a game , as the mets did on monday in losing to the marlins , 96 , in miami , the inevitable question to ask is whether there has ever been a game in which their fielding was worse for what it s worth , the answer is yes back on aug 1 , 1996 , in a game against the pittsburgh pirates at shea stadium , the mets made seven errors in losing , 139 and just two seasons ago , on april 27 , 2012 , the mets made six errors in an 189 disaster in colorado in which the rockies scored 11 runs in the fifth inning nothing that awful happened on monday , although after the game , mets manager terry collins was none too happy it was n't a bigleague baseball game , i can tell you that , he told reporters the mets went into monday s game having made 81 errors this season , a total that left them right in the middle of the pack when ranked with the other 29 major league teams but now they have 87 three of monday s six errors came in the eighth inning , when the marlins broke a 66 tie , with reliever jeurys familia twice making errant throws and catcher travis darnaud contributing a bad toss of his own earlier in the game , david wright made an error , and the newest member of the lineup , dilson herrera , made two , including one in which he , too , made a bad throw the 20yearold herrera is regarded as one of the team s top prospects he hit 340 at class aa binghamton this season and is currently filling in for the injured daniel murphy going into monday s games , murphy led the national league in base hits , with 159 he also had more errors , 15 , than any other second baseman in baseball in line with that theme , herrera did have a good day at the plate on monday , hitting his first major league home run and his first major league triple , and driving in three runs meanwhile , mets starter zack wheeler did not make any errors , but he did not pitch particularly well , either , throwing 114 pitches in less than five innings before being replaced
each team s offseason begins with pages full of names , players identified as being available through free agency or potentially available through a trade as clubs pore over data and analyze their budgets , these pages are whittled down to a simple shortlist the ' pursuit of a lateinning reliever , identified by general manager ben cherington as an area of need , began and ended with one name edward mujica he does a lot of things we care about he throws strikes he s been very consistent he can get lefties out as well as righties , cherington said so i think the combination of factors led us to focus on him also important for boston was mujica s versatility , which would allow him to close games when koji uehara was unavailable that ability to finish games is particularly important now because uehara has been unavailable for the several days after feeling stiffness in his right shoulder uehara was to be evaluated further monday in boston in the meantime , boston will turn to mujica , who allowed four runs in his second appearance for the red sox but none in his two appearances since the twoyear , 95 million contract that boston gave its replacement closer now looks to be another shrewd move by a front office that has moved away from its bigspending ways the red sox built a world series winner last year by shopping mostly in the bargain bin of the freeagent market relievers can be volatile , cherington said every team in baseball goes through that , and you see examples of it every year you have to factor that risk into your thinking and the way you put a bullpen together although mujica had 37 saves last season for the st louis cardinals , the national league champions , he was not seen as a highprofile free agent he had lost his closer job in september after allowing five runs in a sevengame stretch , which raised his earned run average to 226 , from 173 but mujica later revealed that he had sustained groin muscle and neck injuries near the end of the season the red sox held an advantage during freeagent negotiations manager john farrell was the director of cleveland s farm system when mujica , whom the indians signed as an amateur free agent in 2001 , began his career there in addition , boston s bench coach , torey lovullo , had managed mujica in the cleveland system mujica turned down opportunities to close for other teams in order to be reunited with farrell and lovullo we had a great relationship and a great respect for one another during those years in cleveland , mujica said for that reason , i came here i had a very enjoyable conversation with torey during spring training when he told me how happy they were to have me here and i'm extremely happy here for most of his career , mujica has been undervalued in 2008 , he was a noteworthy but not highly regarded prospect in the indians' organization he bounced between the minors and the majors for three seasons , and the indians would have had to expose him to waivers if they had decided to send him to the minors again the san diego scout bill bryk had seen mujica in the minor leagues in 2008 and had liked his presence on the mound he recommended mujica to kevin towers , then the padres' general manager the padres acquired him for only 30 , 000 his contract at the time was a bargain , said towers , now the arizona diamondbacks' general manager he had a 92 to 95mileperhour fastball with plus command with an aboveaverage split finger pitch , which was a swingandmiss pitch in 2009 , mujica led all san diego relievers with 932 3 innings , saving two games and even starting four games for the first time in his career , he spent a full season in the majors that year became key in his development in 2009 , when i got to san diego , i was still a pitcher who just liked to throw fastballs , mujica said i would rarely use my breaking pitches he was lucky to be paired with a veteran catcher , and a fellow venezuelan , henry blanco , who was highly regarded for his ability to work with pitchers the two would often speak before and after games about strategy , and they spent time watching video i always thought eduardo had great stuff , blanco , now a member of arizona s coaching staff , said in a phone interview the only thing was that he needed help understanding how to sequence hitters in 2010 , the padres traded mujica to the marlins , who then traded him to the cardinals in the middle of the 2012 season he posted a 103 era in 261 3 innings with st louis that year when the cardinals lost jason motte to an injury early in 2013 and mitchell boggs struggled , the club gave mujica the closer s job it was a surprising choice , but he excelled until that injurystricken september from april through august , mujica had that 173 era and a stunning 1433 strikeouttowalk ratio , which led the majors this offseason , the indians were one of the teams that pursued mujica it was a testament to what mujica had accomplished but mujica had his own list he whittled it to one the red sox
balaklava , ukraine reduced to a ghoulish tourist attraction by the collapse of the soviet union , the former pride of the black sea fleet a topsecret nuclear submarine base burrowed into a rocky hill and worthy of a james bond villain was closed on saturday for technical reasons , announced a handwritten note taped to the ticket window a more likely but unannounced reason was the sudden appearance just a few hundred yards away of 10 russian troop trucks crammed with soldiers , five armored vehicles mounted with machine guns , a communications van and , most ominous of all , three military ambulances none of the heavily armed soldiers had insignia on their green combat uniforms , and for days , russia insisted that it was just a spectator to the dramatic events unfolding in the ukrainian region of crimea and was as puzzled as everyone else by the identities of masked gunmen who had seized crimea s two main airports and its parliament and main government office buildings then on saturday , russia pulled down the mask to openly display its determination to seize control black license plates used by russia s black sea fleet as opposed to the white ones issued by ukrainian authorities were clearly visible on the military vehicles lined up on the main road into balaklava , a beautiful and highly strategic deepwater bay it was here that ukraine , when it still controlled crimea , stationed coast guard , customs and border officers it is also where british troops established their own base during the 185356 crimean war and then made their suicidal charge of the light brigade against russian forces the loudest echoes of history on saturday , however , stretched back not to the 19th century , but to more recent episodes of russian muscle flexing in an almost wordperfect replay of moscow s cold war interventions in hungary in 1956 , czechoslovakia in 1968 and afghanistan in 1979 after appeals for fraternal assistance from embattled local allies , russia s troop mobilization in crimea on saturday followed a request for help from crimea s new promoscow prime minister , sergei aksyonov , who was named thursday by regional legislators meeting under the guns of the unidentified intruders the kremlin quickly issued a statement saying that mr aksyonov s plea would not be ignored , and within hours it had announced its plans for military action but in stark contrast to soviet deployments in recalcitrant foreign lands , the conspicuous display of might on saturday met not with fierce resistance at least not in heavily russian areas of crimea like balaklava but with a mix of delight and eerie calm i have been hoping for this from the very beginning , said ilina kulkova , an ethnic russian resident of the nearby city of sevastopol , after learning that the russian parliament had authorized the use of military force in ukraine , of which crimea has been a part since 1954 russia is the only guarantor of our security , she said , adding that she did not know anybody who is complaining she acknowledged that she had not heard complaints because she did not know anybody who supported the nazi gangster regime that she and many other ethnic russians living in crimea and also the kremlin believe , the ukrainian capital , following the flight of the country s elected president , viktor f yanukovych while ethnic russians rejoiced , however , crimea s other main populations , muslim tatars and ukrainians , mourned a return to an era thought to have ended with the cold war at bakhchysarai , the historic capital of crimea before the tatars were conquered by russia in the 18th century and then deported en masse to central asia by stalin , chiygoz ahtem , the head of the local tatar council , huddled gloomily with supporters around a television in his office , gasping in disbelief at reports of ukraine s crumbling authority in the region boasting that he had helped his community form units to protect themselves , mr ahtem said tatars do not like to speak loudly , but our people made their choice a long time ago we are part of ukraine , not russia he declined to say whether his followers had guns , offering only a highfive when asked whether there could be armed resistance but with tatars vastly outnumbered by ethnic russians , mr ahtem placed most of his hopes in an expectation that foreign powers would not let russia s naked aggression pass without a response in the 21st century , the international community cannot be a bystander , he said a few miles away , at a makeshift roadblock of concrete slabs flying russian flags and manned by russian selfdefense volunteers and hairy members of a russian motorcycle gang , a big black banner with red letters gave a blunt warning russia has always been the graveyard of evil ideas you cannot win over a graveyard , you can only stay in it forever in simferopol , the crimean capital , about 400 people had gathered , some holding placards saying free ukraine from us occupation and the usa works with fascism a woman held up a photo of president obama with a red line through it and the caption yankee go home , and led a chant to that effect earlier in the day , scores of armed men believed to be russian soldiers and hundreds of supporters had massed at street corners and blocked roads but by nightfall , they had withdrawn , and the city was quiet ukraine s own military in crimea , far weaker than russian forces stationed permanently on the crimean peninsula , appeared to be stuck in deep despondency , hoping that russia was engaged in a giant bluff and had no real intention of fighting a nervous ukrainian military officer , who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity , acknowledged that ukraine s forces were no match for russia s but added that they had nonetheless received orders from kiev to open fire if attacked at ukraine s kirovsky military airfield late on friday , ukrainian forces tried briefly to stop a small group of russian troops from entering the russians , said the ukrainian officer , smashed up the airfield navigation equipment , apparently to make sure that ukraine would not be able to fly in reinforcements on saturday evening , russian armored personnel carriers cruised through the center of sevastopol , obeying the speed limit as residents looked on as ukrainian leaders in kiev , 400 miles to the north , fumed at what they denounced as an invasion that violated international law , more than a thousand residents of sevastopol , the home of the black sea fleet , gathered on saturday night for a celebratory outdoor concert in a central square featuring the fleet s naval choir and cossack singers the audience waved russian flags and banners declaring crimea part of russia as cars drove by honking their horns in support in balaklava , young couples , families with infants and doddering pensioners came out to admire the russian military column , strolling up and down through a park adjacent to the road blocked by the soldiers , as if just out to enjoy the suddenly warm coastal air by nightfall , several hundred people had gathered for a joyous rally beside a world war ii memorial near the entrance to balaklava bay are you for russia or ukraine \? asked a speaker in unison , the crowd , waving russian flags , roared back russia ! russia !
paris the largest retrospective ever of the american video artist bill viola opened at the grand palais here last week with 20 hightech works that draw on ageold themes , the exhibition , which runs through july 21 , showcases the artist s work over the past 40 years in a series of large , darkened rooms that take on the hushed quality of a chapel although the show begins with the reflecting pool \( 19771979 \) , the earliest piece in the exhibition , a video projection with a grainy , kodachrome feel , and ends with the dreamers \( 2013 \) , mr viola s most recent creation , with seven highresolution screens each showing a person under water , it is not organized chronologically instead , mr viola , his wife and collaborator , kira perov , and the exhibition organizer j r me neutres , arranged the exhibition around three metaphysical questions who am i \? where am i \? where am i going \? the exhibit is based on a journey , mr viola , a mellow 63 , said in an interview at the grand palais last week normally there s a timeline we 've done it based on emotions you keep the people inside the images he said he urged visitors to take their time to create their own journey indeed , the show s darkness draws visitors in , and the videos unfold at a meditative pace , compelling viewers to slow down in the veiling , which had its premiere at the venice biennale in 1995 , images of a man and a woman walking slowly are projected on nine translucent panels we say we 're giving people the gift of time , ms perov said mr viola and ms perov , who live in long beach , california and have two grown sons , have worked together since they met in the 1970s he has the visions , she helps realize them , along with a small technical team mr neutres , who curated the exhibition for the grand palais , said he hoped that the show would bring mr viola , long a fixture in the art world , to a broader public he likened it to a retrospective of picasso at the grand palais in 1966 , which brought the spanish artist fully into the wider public consciousness bill viola in 2014 is like picasso in 1966 , mr neutres said mr viola s works draw as much from classical painting and modern dance as from film some works feature small lcd screens , some lifesize monitors , others wallsize projections some , like four hands \( 2001 \) , in which four different pairs of hands clasp each other for 23 minutes , have no narrative none of the works uses dialogue in other works , mr viola casts characters to create miniature works of theater the quintet of the astonished \( 2000 \) recalls a caravaggio painting , in which five figures interact in slow motion a centerpiece of the exhibition is going forth by day \( 2002 \) , the largest and most technically complex work in the show , which uses a cast of around 100 people and features five different scenes projected on the walls , which the artist has said is meant to recall giotto s frescoes in the basilica of saint francis in assisi , italy the exhibition also includes many of mr viola s bestknown works , such as catherine s room \( 2001 \) , a series of five small television monitors showing a woman s daily existence in a spare room a book of hours come to life and the sleep of reason \( 1988 \) , a video homage to goya s the sleep of reason produces monsters , in which flashes of a man s nightmares are projected onto the gallery walls although his work draws on christian themes and motifs , including ascensions and annunciations , mr viola said he preferred to think of his work as spiritual rather than religious the vatican had asked him to participate in its firstever pavilion at last year s venice biennale i politely declined , he said but his work has sometimes been shown in churches , and he is preparing an ambitious new video on martyrs that will premiere in st paul s cathedral in london in may back at the grand palais , the final rooms of the exhibition turn to darker musings on mortality they begin with the arresting 2005 works tristan s ascension , in which the literary hero is swept upward in a lingering shower of raindrops , and fire woman , in which a woman stands in black against a wall of fire mr viola said that his work had fundamentally changed after the deaths of his parents in the 1990s the 2013 diptych , man searching for immortality woman searching for eternity , show an older man and woman inspecting their respective bodies with a flashlight in one of the scenes of going forth by day , a man in a hat sits crosslegged on a porch overlooking a tranquil lake , off a room in which a couple mourn an old man who has just died the seated man is mr viola himself , who has snuck into his own work , on the border between nature and the domestic , life and death it is me , mr viola said that s kind of where i live
season 2 , episode 8 it s all about privilege in this episode who benefits and who doesn t and it should surprise none of us at this point in the story \( or history \? \) that our white heroine from connecticut is the chief recipient piper gets her furlough after healy makes some calls harder to judge is whether we re supposed to be annoyed by her going on about her grandmother \( as i was am i alone \? \) certainly the more compelling story is about one who is denied privilege that s rosa , a hispanic woman with cancer who has existed as little more than a shapeless pile making acrid comments from her bunk she needs surgery she will die without it but the department of corrections won t pay we ll stick with chemo , healy tells her , trying to be sympathetic we \? she shoots back you got cancer in your ovaries , too \? healy is apparently just the latest in a long string of men to leave rosa disappointed , as we see in the flashbacks to her career as a bank robber \( a really good one , apparently , until she pushes her luck one last time \) we see her in the backseat of a car about to make her first heist she s nervous , and resists as her boyfriend \( he oozes feckless \) gives her a gun taking it only when he assures her that it makes her look cool then he tells her the ritual we kiss before , we kiss after this bit of romance annoys andy and don , the two guys in the front seat , but they all pull off the caper , and rosa quickly realizes how good the life of crime makes her feel , how good the money smells better than drakkar noir ! feckless boyfriend agrees , in a nice bit of 80s color but then , he s bleeding , shot at the last moment by a guard , and he dies that does not deter rosa we see her with the second beau andy , the driver from the first heist we kiss before , we kiss after , she tells him it s good luck then he dies of a heart attack just as they reach the getaway car she s stuck with don , the last man , and they have just pulled off a 50 , 000 job she makes him pull the car aside for the after kiss he resists , and she s just forcing herself on him when she realizes they re parked next to a bank she wants the after kiss , but she wants more money more she goes in alone , and we see her next in prison , talking to don , who s still on the free side crime may not pay , but it still animates rosa , even as she sits for her chemo treatments she cases the joint to coach her fellow cancer patient , a punky teenager , on how to steal a wallet from a drunkard nurse the take is 63 , and he quibbles when she gives him only 20 i was the brains , she tells him as she s leaving for the day , she sees him with his mother , crying , and fears for a moment that he s going to die , that she s cursed him all the men in my life die , she tells him , crushed no he s in remission , he tells her rosa laughs , cackles , really , as she tosses a farewell over her shoulder and we see her last piled in her bunk , sniffing her 43 and smiling piper s furlough , meanwhile , has turned out to be something of a curse for her piper blissfully , cluelessly , tells them how she needs to be with her grandmother and ask her all the questions she never got to ask maybe this prison has a heart after all , she says but over and over inmates tell her how they were denied for a husband getting openheart surgery , a father dying after a lung transplant it hits a peak in the cafeteria as the black inmates gather at one table , piper and the white inmates at another chapman ain t got no strife in her life , poussey says , but she gets the red carpet laid out for her new jim crow , says vee piper finally has enough and stands up i guess white privilege wins again , she says and as a speaker for the entire white race , i would like to say that i am sorry that you guys got the raw deal the speech is eloquent , i guess , but convinces no one crazy throws pie not for piper , as was once the case , but at her , a nice hunk of blueberry right in her freshly blown out blonde hair she goes to healy and offers to give up her furlough he gives her a good speech to knock it off and appreciate the gift , and she agrees but when she finally reaches her mother to ask about a ride home , her mother tells her that the grandmother has died the night before but i m getting out , piper says , then dissolves i did like the piper grandmother story line for the scenes of her with the older prisoners the show is sharp on so much about women , but the commentary on women and age feels freshest the older women tell more about jimmy cavanaugh the demented inmate who was sent away so unceremoniously after she strayed in the last episode they hid her condition for years , they tell piper , tracking her down when she strayed , at least once a week who will feed her , take care of her , piper asks she ll be dead in a week , they tell her no one cares about old ladies we remind everyone that they re going to die in the ratcheting race wars , red is trying to cozy up to mendoza vee sees this and tries to win mendoza over herself with a cigarette a fresh one this time i am not going to get caught up in the middle of some whitey vs blacky war , mendoza tells red i think she may have no choice when it comes to women , apparently , power runs through the kitchen the prison staff , meanwhile , is in a war on contraband particularly after fig gets gum on the sole of her louboutins \( so that s where the embezzled money goes !

second terms are often a time when presidents , balked by domestic opposition , turn to the world stage to secure their legacy opening doors to china , closing out the cold war , chasing middle eastern peace but the global stage has n't been a secondterm refuge for president obama it s been an arena of setbacks , crises and defeats his foreign policy looked modestly successful when he was running for reelection now it stinks of failure failure is a relative term , to be sure his predecessor s invasion of iraq still looms as the largest american blunder of the postvietnam era none of obama s difficulties have rivaled that debacle and many of the sweeping conservative critiques of his foreign policy that obama has weakened america s position in the world , that he s too chary about using military force lack perspective on how much damage the iraq war did to american interests , and how many current problems can be traced back to errors made in 2003 but the absence of an iraqscale fiasco is not identical to success , and history should n't grade this president on a curve set by donald rumsfeld obama is responsible for the initiatives he s pursued , the strategies he s blessed and the priorities he s set and almost nothing on that list is working out start with libya , the site of obama s own war of choice the consuming republican focus on benghazi has tended to obscure the fact that postqaddafi libya is generally a disaster area its government nonfunctional , its territory a , its former ruler s weaponry and fighters destabilizing subsaharan africa \( some of for instance , appear to be in the hands of nigeria s mostwanted kidnappers , boko haram \) then swing northeast to syria , where this administration s stated policy is that bashar alassad , and that there is a red line backed by force , if necessary around the use of chemical weapons well , assad is n't going he s and the white house s claims of progress on the chemical weapons front were undermined by secretary of state john kerry s acknowledgment last week that suggested a number of instances in which assad s government used chlorine gas the picture does n't look better when you turn south or east in the holy land , kerry s recent push for israelipalestinian negotiations ended in predictable failure , and in iraq the caldron is boiling and iranian influence is growing in part , the new yorker s last month , because the white house s indecision undercut negotiations that might have left a small but stabilizing us force in place similar statusofforces negotiations are ongoing in afghanistan , and the backdrop is even grimmer the surge of forces ordered by obama \( also amid much indecision \) failed to replicate the success of gen david petraeus s salvage operation in iraq , and even with an american presence are barely being held at bay as for the white house s major diplomatic projects , one the reset with russia has ended in the shambles of the ukraine crisis a second , the opening to iran , is still being pursued , with deadlines looming , and it s the administration s best remaining hope for a paradigmaltering achievement but that hope is still a thin one \( complicated , for instance , by iran s continuing \) , and it s just as likely that obama will have unsettled america s existing alliances in the region to very little gain as for the promised pivot to asia , let me know when it actually happens , and maybe i 'll have something to say about it the point of this litany is not to suggest that all of obama s decisions have been misguided \( i sympathized with the decision to slip free of iraq entirely , and i'm glad we do n't have 50 , 000 troops occupying syria \) , or that there s some strategic reboot that would clear all these problems up in a world that s necessarily beyond an american president s control , even the wisest choices can lead to disappointing results but most presidents do win some clear victories not everyone gets to end the cold war , but there s usually some diplomatic initiative that leaves a positive legacy \( even jimmy carter had the camp david accords \) , some military or humanitarian intervention \( even george w bush had his aidsinafrica initiative \) that looks like a success yet except for the killing of osama bin laden an except that has to be qualified by islamist terrorism s if obama s presidency ended today i have no idea what major foreign policy achievements his defenders could reasonably cite there is still time for it to be otherwise for the administration to brilliantly exploit vladimir putin s possible overreach , or seal a lasting nuclear deal with iran , or craft a strategy to soothe the nationalisms gathering on the indian subcontinent and the pacific rim but recent events do not inspire much confidence instead , future defenses of obama s foreign policy may boil down to just six words at least he did n't invade iraq
kissi town , sierra leone military choppers thunder over the slums nearly a thousand british soldiers are on the scene , ferrying supplies and hammering together new clinics crates of food and medicine are flowing into the port , and planeloads of experts seem to arrive every day ugandan doctors , chinese epidemiologists , australian logisticians , even an ambulance specialist from london but none of it was reaching isatu sesay , a sick teenager she flipped on her left side , then her right , writhing on a foam mattress , moaning , grimacing , mumbling and squinching her eyes in agony as if she were being stabbed her family and neighbors called an hotline more than 35 times , desperate for an ambulance for three days straight , isatu s mother did not leave her post on the porch , face gaunt , arms slack , eyes fixed up the road toward the capital , freetown , where the ebola command center was less than 45 minutes away this is nonsense , said mc kabia , coordinator of the volunteer ebola task force in isatu s area help rarely came , he said , and people were quietly dying all over the place while health officials say they are making headway against the ebola epidemic in neighboring , the disease is still raging in , despite the big international push in november alone , the world health organization has reported more than 1 , 800 new cases in this country , about three times as many as in liberia , which until recently had been the center of the outbreak more than six weeks ago , international health officials conceded that they were overwhelmed in sierra leone and reluctantly until enough hospital beds could be built here , they pledged to at least help families tend to their sick loved ones at home the health officials admitted plan b was a major defeat , but said the approach would only be temporary and promised to supply basics like protective gloves , painkillers and rehydration salts even that did not happen in isatu s case nobody brought her food nobody brought her any rehydration salts or tylenol no health workers ever talked to her about who she might have touched , which means anyone directly connected to her could now be walking through freetown s teeming streets , where despite the government s abc campaign , avoid body contact people continue to give high fives , hug and kiss in public community volunteers said isatu s case was the norm , not the exception we have a huge number of death cases , said mr kabia , the volunteer ebola coordinator in isatu s area , kissi town , adding that residents rarely survived because of the slow response discouraged , scared and furious , sierra leoneans are taking matters into their own hands laidoff teachers \( all schools in this country are closed \) race around on motorbikes , monitoring the sick in some villages , informal isolation centers are popping up , with citizens quarantining one another , an incredibly dangerous ad hoc solution being performed without appropriate protection \( united nations officials say this country is still short hundreds of thousands of protective suits \) on freetown s outskirts , burly youth are setting up roadblocks the police are nowhere to be found the young men barricade the road , but instead of wielding weapons , they brandish infrared thermometers show me your forehead , commanded a ringleader , wearing a white tank top and baseball cap askew a passenger leaned out of the car while the ringleader scanned his head 985 the posse then lifted the barricade , keeping anyone sick out of their neighborhood fever is the scarlet letter of ebola just about every important building in freetown hotels , banks , government offices is now manned by a guard with an infrared thermometer and a bucket of diluted bleach for a mandatory hand wash but in the slums , it is a different story in kissi town , an underserved area of dirt roads and dirty wells , the local ebola task force said that more than 150 people had recently died of the virus , and that many had received no food , medicine or any other help stuck in her house , waiting for an ambulance , isatu kept burning up she was intensely nauseated , she said , but still able to walk a few steps , an important factor if they walk in , their chances are good , said komba songu m'briwa , a doctor at an ebola clinic if they have to be carried in , well by last friday morning , isatu was not walking anywhere she had become too weak to stand her chances were plummeting she curled up on the floor , her jeans splotched with dried black vomit she was delirious , eyes bolted open , huge and blank a shadow would cross the threshold and they would not even flicker the virus was moving faster than all the aid workers put together i 've called 10 times myself , said abu bakar kamara , a community volunteer , as he paced the scratched dirt yard in front of isatu s house no response sierra leone has an elaborate ebola response system on paper it starts with a call to 117 , the tollfree number for central dispatch a surveillance team is sent out , then an ambulance takes a patient to a holding center , then blood tests and a proper treatment center where the patient might receive intravenous fluids or other special care but the ebola clinics do not have nearly enough beds , especially in freetown , and an ambulance will not show up at a sick person s house unless there is a bed somewhere for that patient the government says it needs 3 , 000 beds nationwide but has fewer than half of that now ambulances are hurtling across the country for hours to remote clinics in the east , where there are a few vacancies the roads are horrendously bumpy the jungle heat without reprieve many patients are dead on arrival western officials are quick to add that even if all the resources were in the right place , that would not stop the virus you can have as many helicopters , ships and kit here as you 'd like , said lt colonel matt petersen , a british adviser but unless you change behavior , it s not going to stop transmission public health professionals are beginning to look harder at sierra leone s culture , which is dominated by secret men s and women s societies that have certain rituals , especially around burials many people here just like in other cultures believe that the afterlife is more important than this one a proper burial , in which the body is touched and carefully washed , is the best way to ensure a soul reaches its destination it is not pure altruism , either if burial traditions are not followed , people worry they may be haunted by a restless soul but in a time of ebola , handling corpses is extremely risky because they are highly infectious seventy percent of new cases here , western officials said , are directly linked to traditional burials kissi town elders said that their outbreak started in early october after the funeral of a wellknown society woman , as members of secret societies are called her name was yawullu , and she was known for handling dead bodies after yawullu died from ebola , an underling insisted on sleeping next to her corpse for three straight days that second society woman then contracted ebola too , and it shot through the community , elders said that s what s breeding ebola , dr songu m'briwa , a surgeon at a nearby clinic , said secret societies neighboring liberia has many of the same secret societies , but some anthropologists said that the liberian government may have done a better job working with the leaders of secret societies to change burial practices , one possible reason liberia s ebola crisis has been stabilizing another issue are strikes this week , burial workers in eastern sierra leone dragged corpses from a morgue and dumped them outside to protest delays in being paid in freetown last week , some surveillance workers the emergency medical workers to suspected cases refused to work , demanding back pay , which added to the problems of dispatching ambulances on saturday afternoon , isatu s neighbors saw what they had been waiting for , rumbling up the road a white truck with break the chain painted on the hood help had finally arrived but this was not the ebola team they had hoped for , evident by the way the workers slowly exited the vehicle and quietly suited up isatu had died in the evening the family said she was around 16 and loved a local game called balance ball the burial team moved fast , four white blurs through the door her mother seemed too exhausted to cry an hour later , all that remained of this teenage girl was a mound of dirt in a makeshift graveyard with a thin , flat stick poking out the marker , placed in a growing forest of them , said 349 , isatu sesay
wilmington , del if the delaware art museum has a signature painting , surely it is howard pyle s marooned a native of this city , pyle is justly remembered as the father of american illustration his marooned \( 1909 \) is an image of genuine drama and distress it shows a pirate near death , curled up on a sand bar , a tiny figure enveloped by a burning yellow sky the painting refers to the old custom of punishing insubordinates by shoving them off a ship and onto an island but these days , you can also view marooned as a curiously precise description of the delaware art museum it , too , has been ostracized by its peers in june , it was formally sanctioned by the association of art museum directors , which has asked its members not to lend artwork to delaware or assist with its exhibitions the spanking came one day after the museum sold a painting from its collection , william holman hunt s isabella and the pot of basil trustees say that the sale was the only way to help settle a 198 million expansion debt and plump the museum s endowment now , for the first time , the museum is confirming that it will sell two more works the first , winslow homer s milking time \( 1875 \) , is a masterpiece of american genre painting , a quietly intense farm scene in which a mother and son turn away and gaze over a wooden fence that seems to say something about heldback emotion the homer will be offered in a sotheby s auction this fall , unless a buyer turns up first that is our plan of attack , gerret copeland , the chairman of the delaware museum board , explained if we find a private buyer , it will go sooner the second work slated for sale is alexander calder s the black crescent , a mobile which arched gracefully above the museum s doubleheight east court they 're just cherrypicking the best things in the hopes they get to where they need to be , said timothy rub , the president of the museum directors group , as well as the director of the philadelphia museum of art if , as with the holman hunt , they fall flat on their face , it s going to be a double tragedy auctions are risky christie s , entrusted with the holman hunt , confidently estimated its value at 84 million to 134 million but the painting sold for 425 million half the low estimate in some ways , the situation in delaware can be seen as a cautionary tale about the perils of overexpansion in 2005 , the museum completed a construction project that doubled its space glass wings rose up on either side of the original building , a trim , redbrick , georgianstyle structure that brought to mind a suburban bank but renovating and enlarging art museums , which has become so popular you might think size was the goal of art , is no guarantee of larger audiences revealingly , the delaware museum s membership is down to 1 , 600 households , from a peak of about 3 , 000 in 2001 , said jessica jenkins , a museum spokeswoman selling artwork to fund operations \( as opposed to acquisitions \) is widely viewed as selfdefeating , like burning down your house to heat the kitchen museums are supposed to safeguard art for future generations , not cash in or out and as the sale of the holman hunt proved , it does n't always go as hoped we 're disappointed that it did n't go for more , and so is christie s and everybody else , said michael miller , who became chief executive and director of the museum a year ago , after serving as its chief financial officer is it a fair price \? who knows \? i do n't know the painting was purchased by a telephone bidder who some say is john h schaeffer , an australian businessman and art collector , who did not respond to a request for comment mr miller , 64 , is not likely to be called a connoisseur as he himself put it on the afternoon we met in the museum s offices , i know nothing about art he joined the museum staff seven years ago , after retiring from dupont merck , a pharmaceutical company that he helped found asked to name a work at the museum that he likes , he replied jeez i never thought about that well , i actually like picasso , but we do n't have any picassos to some degree , the situation in wilmington might seem analogous to one at the detroit institute of arts , which has been batting away pleas that it liquidate its masterpiecestocked collection in truth , there is no such thing anymore as a priceless painting every rembrandt or van gogh can be appraised , and works that once seemed safely ensconced in museum galleries are being viewed as cash machines in goldleaf frames true , wilmington is much smaller than detroit , and already doused in cash known as a tax haven , it remains a magnet for creditcard companies , perhaps because a state law eliminated the cap on the interest rates banks can charge customers the city is home to vice president joseph r biden jr and the dupont chemical company , one of whose heirs is mr copeland , the museum chairman asked how he chose the holman hunt for selling , as opposed to any of the 12 , 500odd other works in the museum s collection , mr miller said the process was relatively straightforward you might assume that he met with the museum s curators , asking them to weed out works that struck them as inferior , or too similar to other works to merit space but the curators were never consulted they did n't want to have anything to do with this , mr miller said and we did n't want to bring them into this instead , he deferred to the marketplace he contacted art appraisers from sotheby s , christie s and bonhams , and had them valuate a very short list of works the museum had purchased over the years gifts or bequests were excluded , to minimize the potential of lawsuits from donors or their heirs probably none of this would have occurred if danielle rice were still the director of the delaware art museum she resigned last summer to oversee a museum studies program at drexel university in philadelphia trustees always talk about selling things , but i was very clear on the fact that it was not a viable course of action , she noted in an email unfortunately , it does look like i was the only thing standing in the way of their taking action despite its small size , the delaware museum is a singular institution with patches of blazing strength it has always mingled high art and popular illustration to a degree that is almost unheardof at american museums founded in 1912 , a year after pyle s death , it set out specifically to preserve his legacy as the leading magazine and book illustrator of the late 19th century at last count , the museum owned 1 , 412 of his works , accomplished images of pirates , intrepid soldiers and medieval knights in clanking armor the pyles , in a way , set the tone for the whole museum , alerting visitors to the love of storytelling that runs through so much of american art many artists in the collection , including homer and edward hopper , began their careers as commercial illustrators and never abandoned the seductions of narrative hopper s summertime \( 1943 \) , a museum standout , is a city scene in which a shapely redhead in a floppy hat lingers outside of an apartment building , waiting for someone who might never arrive the museum also has the largest collection of british preraphaelite painting in america , thanks to a bequest from a longgone local collector preraphaelite painting is probably an acquired taste , and not everyone will thrill to the galleries where pale women with flowing orangered hair and pouty lips swoon and wilt as if they had taken one too many sleeping pills isabella and the pot of basil , the holman hunt that flopped at auction , was a linchpin of the museum s preraphaelite holdings the painting is admittedly bizarre , portraying a darkhaired heroine from a john keats poem hiding the head of her dead lover in a leafy houseplant you do n't have to be a cultural alarmist to wonder what other works could be plucked from the museum s collection and pitched like so many wares asked whether the museum might jettison its pyles , mr miller shook his head , and said , they do n't have a lot of value he was referring to financial value , of course , and it seemed altogether sad that the works that bore the highest price tags were also the most vulnerable to being disowned in the meantime , the delaware art museum remains sanctioned by the museum association , which represents 242 art museum directors who tend to agree about the need for professional standards mr miller , who resigned from the organization in march , speaks of it indifferently it s a club that i do n't need to belong to , he said the good news is that people who support us do n't really care about what they say he added , on a more conciliatory note , i reached out to the aamd , and i told them , we would like to talk to you and see if there s any way we could work something out' they were appreciative of the contact , and we had a lot of discussions christine anagnos , the executive director of the group , recalls a different sequence of events last november , she said , she received a phone call from an unidentified woman who tipped her off to a proposed sale ms anagnos and mr rub contacted mr miller and arranged to visit wilmington to try to convince him that there were better ways to raise money than liquidating a museum s collection their first and last meeting was held on jan 7 , and mr rub made specific suggestions he advised mr miller and mr copeland to mount a major fundraising drive he recommended that they enlist the help of state legislators who perhaps could talk to wells fargo , which was demanding immediate repayment of the bond , and ask the bank to be more flexible gerret copeland said something during our meeting that absolutely astonished me , mr rub recalled , referring to the proposed sale he said we need to do this we simply have n't been able to persuade donors to support us there will be cheering in the streets when we do this' i wanted to use the old john mcenroe line with him , you cannot be serious' for now , there is no loud cheering to be heard outside or inside the museum , although , by a nice coincidence , there is a show of contemporary art that comes with a good deal of sound performance now , a traveling exhibition curated by the veteran art historian roselee goldberg , will remain at delaware through sept 21 it brings together the work of marina abramovic , laurie simmons and allora calzadilla , among others , whose devotion to the improvised gesture the kind of art that melts into air is captured in documentary photos and accompanying props , including hula hoops strewn on the floor compared with the quick fix of selling artwork , an exhibition of new art such as performance now cultivates longterm rewards it reaches out to local people and is likely to pull in new viewers , especially younger ones that is the goal , to engage viewers in their teens and 20s as well as a broader audience of the sort that understands this if you go see art , if you take the trouble to visit museums on the chance that something wondrous might happen , you will never suffer the isolation of pyle s marooned pirate
beijing a few days after the crackdown on the tiananmen square protests 25 years ago , the chinese government filled the airwaves with a list of the 21 most wanted student leaders accused of stirring up an antigovernment rebellion at the top of the list was a 20yearold student at peking university named wang dan , who set up an unofficial student union to mobilize his classmates to demand democracy there was no public mention then and there have been very few mentions since of the head of the official student union of peking university at that time his name is xiao jianhua mr xiao never opposed the government , and the events of june 1989 did not make him one of china s most wanted instead , they catapulted him into the ranks of its most wealthy after a tepid attempt to represent fellow students to university administrators that volatile spring , mr xiao shifted course , agreeing with administrators that street protests had become out of hand people who knew him at the time said he even worked with them to try to defuse the protests before chinese troops descended on beijing and crushed them with force the rewards were immediate just after he graduated , mr xiao stepped into the world of business with direct financial support from peking university , one of china s most prestigious institutes in the quartercentury since , he became the prototype of the politically connected financier he has assiduously courted the party elite , including the family of its current president , xi jinping , becoming something of a banker for the ruling class and a billionaire in his own right now 42 years old , mr xiao controls a sprawling business empire with interests largely in statedominated industries , including banking , insurance , coal , cement , property and even rareearth minerals , and largely managed by his holding company , the tomorrow group through a series of other investment vehicles , he owns a piece of ping an , one of china s largest insurers , as well as portions of harbin bank , huaxia bank and industrial bank and he has acquired stakes in at least 30 other chinese financial institutions corporate records reviewed by the new york times show that a company he cofounded also paid 24 million last year to buy shares in an investment firm held by the sister and brotherinlaw of mr xi in 2009 , another company he helped control financed a deal that aided a company run by the soninlaw of jia qinglin , then a member of china s powerful politburo standing committee nothing about those deals has been publicly disclosed , and much about mr xiao himself remains mysterious he declined to be interviewed for this article and , while often talked about in financial circles , he has kept a low profile inside china but he is also one of the most active players in the frenzied dealmaking of the last 10 years , and his personal fortune has been estimated at 2 billion by the hurun report , a magazine that prints a list of the richest people in china it is a career made possible , in good part , by the 1989 unrest or , more precisely , by china s reaction against it rather than experiment with greater political openness , as many chinese intellectuals had hoped in the 1980s , the paramount leader of the time , deng xiaoping , pushed faster economic development while tightening the control of the communist party the formula ultimately produced one of the most astounding economic expansions in history but it also made those with good political connections the indispensable middlemen of high finance and convinced many ordinary chinese that the game was rigged corruption , or the appearance of it , was one of the main concerns of students protesting in tiananmen square in 1989 but the scale of collusion between business and political elites has increased markedly since that time , with even the party now acknowledging that insider dealmaking has become a threat to the legitimacy of the communist party there s now this selfdestructive tendency within the party , minxin pei , an expert on china who teaches at claremont mckenna college in claremont , calif , said in an interview many officials regard china s growing wealth as fair game and as a result , corruption has morphed into largescale looting mr xi is now overseeing one of the boldest anticorruption drives in decades during the last two years , scores of businessmen and highranking officials have been detained or stripped of their powers , including a former politburo member , zhou yongkang , whose relatives are suspected of illegally profiting from his oversight of the state oil sector the crackdown is putting pressure on businessmen like mr xiao , who know that if they fall out of favor with the top echelon of the party , their business empires could come crashing down but his associates insist that his investments are marketoriented and that he has engaged in no wrongdoing there are signs , though , that he is not taking any chances with the changing political winds in china some years ago , after chinese news reports suggested that some of his companies were involved in privatizing state assets at belowmarket prices , mr xiao set up a residence in canada , where he had obtained citizenship he now spends much of his time working in hong kong , which is governed independently and when mr xi s sister and brotherinlaw sold their stake last year in a joint venture with a major chinese bank , the buyer was a chinese company cofounded by mr xiao the deal was completed after a june 2012 bloomberg news article about the family fortune of mr xi s relatives xiao jianhua spends much of his time these days at the four seasons hotel in hong kong , surrounded by aides who arrange his meetings with bankers and asian tycoons and female bodyguards who even wipe the sweat from his brow he owns a private jet and has bought multimilliondollar properties in the united states and canada and yet such trappings belie his humble beginnings he grew up in feicheng , a poor farming village in a mountainous region of the eastern chinese province of shandong , one of six children born to a middle school teacher and his wife at a young age , he was , by most accounts , a voracious reader of history and literature every morning , he 'd get up at 5 am and jog into the hills to study , recalled guo qingtao , a childhood friend from the village and later a peking university classmate he could recite every text from memory he even read the teacher s manuals at 14 , mr xiao passed the highly competitive national college entrance exam and won admission to peking university he arrived in beijing , friends say , with tattered clothes but ambitions to be a political leader he loved politics , said zhou chunsheng , his college math tutor and now a professor at the cheung kong graduate school of business in beijing he wanted to be a high official , and he was reading everything social sciences books , marxism , the collected works of mao mr xiao s path to power was interrupted , though , by the most momentous student protests since 1919 at peking university , the students were not just swept up in the protests , they were among the leaders of it the ones who led a march into tiananmen square , the city s axis of political power , to press for political reforms at the time , mr xiao was president of the university s official student union the duties were largely social , organizing lectures and dances , but the post was coveted because of its ties to the communist youth league , a launching pad for future careers in the party but in the spring of 1989 , students at the university began to march on tiananmen square with a list of demands both for university leaders and for the communist party at large mr xiao , as the titular representative of his fellow students , was caught in the middle xiao tried to tell the government what the students demanded , but some of the activists did n't like his conservative approach , so they set up their own organization , says mr guo , his former classmate at the time , he was only 17 years old and was put under a lot of pressure feeling powerless , he went to the library and buried himself in books the responsibility of pressing the student cause fell to a history major named wang dan , who helped set up an alternative student association at the university and organized boycotts , sitins and hunger strikes mr xiao took a new direction exactly what turned mr xiao toward a career in business is unclear but his good standing at peking university , especially at a time when administrators were actively persecuting students involved in the unrest , was a clear benefit from the start his first venture , in the early 1990s , was as a computer reseller , marketing dell , ibm and other personal computer brands near the peking university campus he also set up a series of technology companies that were partly funded by the university , which is run by the state , and sought to encourage business ventures by its graduates none of the ventures grew particularly large , though there were partnerships with american companies like microsoft but last year , in a rare interview with the chinese news media , mr xiao said that these computer undertakings were how he made his first pot of gold , 150 million in the late 1990s , he moved to something even more lucrative the stock market using the tomorrow group and other investment firms , he speculated in stocks and began to acquire large stakes in public companies former colleagues say he succeeded , in part , by cultivating his relationships with government officials and then using those connections to set up or move companies to more fertile ground , such as his native shandong province and the area near baotou , inner mongolia , where his wife was raised at that time , the capital markets were just starting , said mr zhou , his former tutor and onetime business partner he had political connections and knew a lot , and went to local governments and told them he could help them set up listed companies over the next decade , he helped set up dozens of investment firms , and often his partners were government agencies , such as the baotou stateowned assets and supervision commission some of his most successful deals involved buying stakes in midsize financial institutions in smaller chinese cities , often through a complex web of shell or dummy corporations when citigroup and other investors agreed to buy a big stake in the guangdong development bank , for instance , one of mr xiao s investment vehicles puhua investment took an 8 percent interest , and then just weeks later transferred it to another state financial institution few analysts or journalists knew he was involved while shell companies are widely used in china as investment vehicles , securities experts say they can also be employed to hide the ownership stakes of public officials , providing cover for favors distributed by businessmen their frequent use by mr xiao has fanned speculation that he gets privileged access to deals involving state assets and that he shares the benefits with the families of the ruling elite he has had some brushes with controversy in 2006 , a huge staterun power company called luneng was taken over by a group of obscure investment firms after the chinese business magazine caijing published an article about the privatization effort , the authorities ordered officials in shandong province to repurchase the shares records reviewed by the times show that several firms involved in the privatization were affiliated with mr xiao mr xiao was involved as a behindthescenes investor again in 2007 , when a small brokerage firm called pacific securities completed a socalled backdoor listing on the shanghai stock exchange , even though the company had not , as required by regulators , reported profits for three consecutive years through a spokeswoman , mr xiao said the deals were legal and valid he also defended his use of investment vehicles , saying his name is often omitted because he is the chief strategist , and not working on the technical details of the deals after the luneng debacle , he began traveling more frequently to the united states and canada , for extended periods , according to his associates he got disappointed in what was happening in china , his spokeswoman , yu lan , said the environment was n't good so he went overseas mr xiao has acknowledged , through his associates , that he is acquainted with many of the children of china s ruling elite and that he has invested with them usually , he says , it is by coincidence they just happen to be in the same deal but a review of corporate registration records has found that on at least three occasions during the last five years , companies affiliated with mr xiao have struck deals that appear to have benefited the relatives of china s highestranking leaders in january 2009 , for instance , baotou tomorrow technology , a public company that mr xiao has held a big stake in , announced that it would pay about 50 million to acquire a property company in southwest china s historic city of lijiang from zhaode property in beijing the head of zhaode , li botan , is the soninlaw of jia qinglin , who until 2012 was the fourthranking member of the communist party , with a seat on the allpowerful politburo standing committee more recently , a company mr xiao cofounded struck a deal with the relatives of the chinese president , mr xi in january 2013 , a beijingbased company called qinchuan dadi investment company sold its 50 percent stake in an investment firm to a company founded by mr xiao for at least 24 million , the same value the xi relatives bought it for , according to a person familiar with the deal at the time , qinchuan was owned , through several other firms , by the chinese president s sister , qi qiaoqiao , and her husband , deng jiagui , according to corporate records the deal was announced six months after that mr xi s relatives held assets worth more than 300 million and in 2012 , when digital domain , the hollywood visual effects studio cofounded by the film director james cameron , was sold for 30 million to a chinese film company , the financing came from mr xiao and a hong kong company controlled by che feng , the soninlaw of china s former central bank chief , dai xianglong , according to people involved in the deal through his spokeswoman , mr xiao acknowledged that companies he had invested in or partly controlled were involved in the deals but said that he was not the decisionmaker and only became aware of the deals after they were completed while those three deals have never been publicly disclosed , mr xiao did gain some notoriety in china the magazine caixin , for instance , reported in late 2012 that mr xiao was working behind the scenes with a thai conglomerate , the charoen pokphand group , to acquire a 9 billion stake in the chinese insurer ping an with financing from several state banks in the north , in possible violation of rules that bar the use of bank loans in acquiring a stake in a chinese insurance firm a spokeswoman said mr xiao eventually decided not to participate in the ping an deal and expressed frustration that he was portrayed in the news media as a secretive , predatory dealmaker \( through an affiliate , mr xiao had earlier acquired a stake in ping an \) now , mr xiao , eager to improve his image , has quietly made public his intention to give much of his wealth away he has donated more than 50 million to china s two leading universities , peking university and tsinghua university and recently , he pledged to donate 10 million to harvard that is where wang dan , who was exiled to the united states after serving a prison term in china , earned his phd
the new york times reported this week that there was discord throughout the people s liberation army even up to the ranks of the general staff during the protests of 1989 officers and soldiers argued over how to handle the demonstrations and what orders to obey after soldiers carried out the massacre of civilians on june 3 and 4 , 1989 , killing hundreds , possibly thousands , of people , top military officers sought reassurances from communist party leaders that the army would never be deployed again for internal unrest on wednesday , security forces were present around tiananmen square and on nearby streets , but none appeared to be members of the chinese army on some corners , men in green fatigues stood in clusters of three , with at least one in each group carrying an assault rifle these men appeared to be members of the people s armed police , which is charged with quelling riots , and not of the army regular policemen made up the bulk of the security forces some sat inside white vans awaiting orders to be sent into action the military s official newspaper , the people s liberation army daily , made no mention of the turmoil of 1989 in its pages on wednesday it did publish an editorial with the title , the more powerful the military , the more secure the country the editorial went on to argue that a strong military is necessary to withstand threats to a country the devastation of iraq , the disintegration of yugoslavia , ukraine s political chaos without exception these deeply and clearly show that if a country does not have a strong military , like a clay giant it will be unable to withstand wind and rain , the editorial said it went on at present , our country is currently at the crucial stage of transitioning from large to strong the chinese nation has never been as close to realizing the great chinese dream as it is today the editorial said the attempts by the united states to shore up its alliances in asia the united states calls it rebalancing were stirring up trouble in the region the editorial cited national sovereignty and territorial integrity as core interests that the military must defend tensions between china and japan have been on the rise over contested islands and waters in the east china sea the same has been happening between china and southeast asian nations , especially vietnam , over disputes in the south china sea the united states has told china it must allow freedom of navigation in the seas and insisted that china follow international laws on demarcating territorial waters the editorial on wednesday strongly stated china s position we cannot lose one inch of the territory left to us by our ancestors it concluded with this thought there are many options for safeguarding national security , including political , economic and foreign policy means , but military means is always the bottomline method and the last option bree feng contributed research
phoenix my decision to become a whistleblower after 24 years as a physician in a veterans affairs hospital was , at first , an easy one i knew about while waiting for appointments on the va s secret schedules , and i could n't stay silent but there was no response to the two letters i sent to the veterans affairs inspector general , one in late october 2013 and one in early february going public would damage an institution i gave more than two decades of my life to , trying to make a better place for veterans to get their care but i had to be able to sleep at night i retired from the phoenix va medical center in december 2013 when there was no reply to my february letter , i contacted eric hannel , a staff director for the house veterans affairs committee , and told him what i knew i also contacted dennis wagner , a reporter at the arizona republic , who had already been reporting on the problems at the phoenix va hospital the inspector general for veterans affairs has opened , and after meeting with members of his team in phoenix , i have faith in the job that they are doing but i have very little in the internal va inspection that secretary of veterans affairs eric shinseki is conducting through the veterans integrated service network , the umbrella structure created when the va radically decentralized its health care operations in 1995 the difference is between trained investigators from the department of justice whose job it is to ferret out waste , fraud and abuse lying to them can trigger criminal penalties and visn office workers who ask a few questions of clinic staff members who may be afraid to speak the truth out of fear of retribution here s another idea i would much prefer to have debra a draper , the director of the health care government accountability office , conduct an anonymous electronic survey of primary care providers , nurses and clerks at every va hospital and clinic across the nation to find out what they think the real new and returning patient waiting times are then her team should give the hospital administrators a oneweek amnesty period to report their own version of the waiting times if the numbers match , then you have reliable data if they do n't , then send the inspector general out to audit them if the hospital administrators have fudged their data , fire them and prosecute them to the maximum extent under the law a full accounting is necessary in the narrow sense to punish those who engaged in improper or illegal conduct in a larger sense , the accounting is needed because the va must determine the magnitude of its problem in order to design a solution it is apparent to me that the scheduling scandal is a symptom of a much more serious disease a mismatch between the va s mission and its resources today s va health care system in general does a very good job at providing chronic care , and it excels at things like blood pressure and diabetes control it has an excellent computerized records system that is second to none in transferring clinical information from facility to facility across the nation where it breaks down badly , especially out west and in other sparsely populated parts of the country , is in the provision of urgent and emergency care where the distance to any suitable hospital , let alone a va hospital , can be great we should think about giving veterans in these situations something like a vetacare card , which could be used for urgent or emergency care , or both , and subsequent hospitalization if needed this would allow for more immediate treatment , and the va could be billed directly congress and the va need to decide whether to revert to the days of yesteryear , when the va took care only of patients' serviceconnected conditions , along with providing a safety net for our most impoverished veterans or to try to reestablish a more universal program that utilizes the current system s strengths while repairing its weaknesses if so , it is likely that many medical centers would need more financial resources in addition to administrative reform any scandal that befalls the va necessarily lands on the party that is in the white house as this is an election year , we can expect that there will be significant pushback to delay and limit the discovery of negative information which is why i expect my suggestions to be vehemently opposed by the white house and the va s upper management i am worried about the patients whose care is entrusted to the va , and i am skeptical about our chances of creating real , longlasting reform but i hope that this time we will it is easy , especially on memorial day weekend , to pay lip service to the need to support our troops and our veterans but it is much harder to actually do it
after years of rumors and near misses , it finally happened point guard  rondo , a fourtime allstar , and power forward dwight powell have joined the in exchange for brandan wright , jae crowder , jameer nelson , a 2015 firstround pick and a 2016 secondround pick it was an aggressive move by the , who are eager to make a championship push knowing that the 36yearold s years as a premier player are numbered the trade involves two teams pursuing different routes to championship contention the mavericks \( 198 \) hope an upgrade at point guard will propel them into the elite echelon of the brutal western conference meanwhile , the acquire more draft picks and an important trade exception two things that will aid their longterm rebuilding efforts in exchange for a player who was probably leaving in the offseason anyway in 2008 , rondo won an nba title with a boston team that featured kevin garnett , paul pierce and ray allen rondo has shown a knack for taking his game to another level in the playoffs , and he nearly averaged a tripledouble for 14 postseason games in 2009 yet he is far from a known quantity now 28 , he has not recovered his peak form since he tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in january 2013 in the first 38 games of the 201213 season , before his injury , rondo was averaging 111 assists a game and shooting a tidy 484 percent from the field since returning to action last season , he has been neither the whirlwind ballhandler nor the disruptive defender he once was this season , rondo again leads the league in assists per game , but unless he improves his shooting \( currently 40 5 percent \) , he may not do much to boost the mavericks' offense dallas has the best scoring attack in the nba , thanks to talented personnel and coach rick carlisle s elegant system good offenses rely on spacing , and no three players stress a defense s ability to cover the whole floor as do nowitzki , monta ellis and tyson chandler nowitzki is the best shooting big man in history , and his unblockable jump shot stretches the defense to the perimeter chandler is a constant threat to catch a lob for a dunk , and ellis is as quick as they come off the dribble where will rondo , a poor shooter in the middle of the worst shooting season of his career , fit into this ecosystem \? and how will he and carlisle two of the most intelligent , stubborn and sometimes abrasive personalities in the league mesh on the same sideline \? nelson , the guard whom rondo will replace , has been struggling to make shots in his own right , but his advanced shooting statistics are stronger because he shoots so many 3pointers in the long term , rondo , who has indicated a willingness to resign with the mavericks in the offseason , is clearly a better option than nelson but the best fit next to ellis and nowitzki is a big , defensefocused guard who can cover for ellis s deficiencies and cash in on open 3pointers someone like the mavericks backup point guard devin harris , or jason kidd , circa 2011 rondo is a solid defender when locked in , but he is smaller than ellis , loves to dribble , and is a bad deep shooter with rondo around , carlisle may have to rejigger his system to keep the mavericks' offense at the top of the league even if rondo does regain his preinjury form , the mavericks still could end up dearly missing wright , who leads the nba in fieldgoal percentage though a bit smaller than chandler , wright is a similarly capable defender around the rim and a lightsout finisher in the pickandroll he is also crucial insurance should chandler be injured the mavericks would not win a title if they lost chandler , but wright could keep the offense afloat if chandler had to miss a month or two this matters in the hypercompetitive western conference , where a monthlong swoon could mean the difference between homecourt advantage and missing the playoffs this is almost certainly not the last move for the owner mark cuban and the mavericks' front office they will do what they can to upgrade the backup center position and add shooting depth around rondo but defense will continue to be a major concern , and carlisle may end up staggering ellis s and rondo s minutes so that harris can cover guards like james harden , klay thompson , russell westbrook and tony parker , whom harris defended admirably in the playoffs last season when dallas extended san antonio to seven games in the first round things will change in dallas but cuban takes pride in the environment he has helped create since taking over the franchise the facilities are worldclass the coaching staff and training resources are second to none many scoffed when the mavericks invested in ellis , but the combination of carlisle and nowitzki brings out the best in almost any player the mavericks are hoping they can repeat the trick with rondo , and that he can recreate the playoff runs of his celtic days

mcallen , tex shortly before a candlelight vigil on the sidewalk outside , employees of the last abortion clinic in the rio grande valley in south texas shut the doors early thursday evening , making legal abortion unavailable in the poorest part of the state in the wake of tough new restrictions passed last year by the texas legislature the closings on thursday of two clinics operated by whole woman s health the one here in mcallen and another in the east texas city of beaumont are part of a wave of clinic closings brought on by the new law there were 44 facilities that performed abortions in texas in 2011 , abortion providers said after the two closings on thursday , there are now 24 , they said when the law is fully implemented in september , that number is expected to drop to six it s heartbreaking for us , said amy hagstrom miller , the chief executive of whole woman s health , which has challenged provisions of the law in court it s been a very difficult decision i tried everything i can i just ca n't keep the doors open antiabortion groups said some of the reasons for the clinic closings were deplorable conditions , violations of state safety regulations and high staff turnover , accusations the operators denied still , abortion opponents expressed satisfaction that the two clinics , which together treated nearly 3 , 000 patients annually , were shutting their doors we are pleased that women will never again receive substandard care from either of these abortion facilities , said joe pojman , executive director of texas alliance for life abortion was a heated political issue last year in texas , when republican lawmakers , backed by gov rick perry , passed some of the toughest restrictions in the country , despite a marathon filibuster that turned state senator wendy davis into a national political figure the politics have since been toned down ms davis did not attend the clinic closings on thursday and has not emphasized the issue in her campaign for governor but the realworld impact has played out in the months since the law passed in mcallen , the shuttering of the city s only abortion clinic has increased the costs , the time and the travel distance for women seeking abortions women have been making a roughly fourhour , 240mile trip to san antonio or a fivehour , 310mile trip to austin to get abortions there had been only two clinics that performed abortions in the rio grande valley , but by the end of the day thursday there were none the other one in nearby harlingen closed days ago activity at the mcallen clinic had slowed recently it stopped performing abortions last year after parts of the law went into effect on tuesday , the aftercare room , where women who had received abortions were taken to recuperate , was cluttered with boxes of files as workers prepared for thursday sometimes on my lunch break , i 'll come back here , and i 'll just sit here , said lucy carreon , the clinic s patient advocate , who is moving to san antonio to work at the whole woman s health facility there it s very sad i ca n't believe it the leaders of whole woman s health , which operates clinics in texas and two other states , said they closed the ones in mcallen and beaumont in large part because of one restriction in the law the requirement that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles ms miller said that nearly all their doctors were unable to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals , and that some hospitals declined to even provide doctors with applications for admitting privileges another part of the law , which takes effect in september , requires clinics to meet surgicalcenter standards , meaning all abortions , including nonsurgical procedures , must take place in hospitalstyle operating rooms it is that requirement that abortion providers say will probably reduce the number of clinics in the state to six and that ms miller said played a role in the decision to close the mcallen and beaumont clinics republican supporters of the law said it would protect women s health and hold abortion clinics to safer standards opponents said that it was an unconstitutional attempt by republicans at a backdoor ban on abortion and was designed to force clinics to close mr perry has stated that one of his goals in office is to make abortion , at any stage , a thing of the past , and another republican leader , lt gov david dewhurst , suggested last year on twitter that shutting clinics was part of the purpose of the law , known as house bill 2 in a statement , ms davis , who is running for governor against attorney general greg abbott , a republican who has defended the law in court , pointed out the other services the clinics provided , beyond abortions , that were now unavailable to many women these health centers provide lifesaving preventive care , cancer screenings and birth control to texan women , she said politicians like greg abbott are forcing their personal political agenda and threatening the health of women across the rio grande valley even before the full regulations kick in , women in rural areas have already had more difficulty getting abortions than those living in urban centers like houston and dallas in the west texas city of lubbock , planned parenthood closed the only clinic there providing abortions , sending many women on a fivehour trip to dallas or to albuquerque , some 320 miles away the closing of the clinic in beaumont has made houston the nearest option , more than an hour s drive away a clinic in corpus christi , which is closer to mcallen than san antonio but is still more than two hours away , is closing in september because of the surgicalcenter requirements in mcallen , the problems associated with traveling 240 miles to san antonio one way including additional costs for gas , lodging or child care have caused some women to go to mexico to buy a that can induce miscarriages and that abortion providers and advocates said poses significant health risks ms carreon , the patient advocate , said she believed 30 to 40 women who had contacted the clinic since last year had decided on their own to take the pill some women interviewed at the mcallen clinic said they had considered taking the 30minute trip to mexico to get the pill a drug called misoprostol known by the brandname cytotec but ultimately decided against it honestly , i think they 'll go south of the border , if they have to , said a 23yearold woman who was one of the last patients to be seen at the clinic and who went to san antonio for an abortion last month it s cheaper and it s closer to go to san antonio is so much more of a hassle and costs a lot more on the day of her appointment in san antonio , the woman , who asked that her name not be used , said she left with a friend at about 3 am to arrive at the clinic by 8 am she had to spend the entire day there waiting to be seen the san antonio clinic , it turned out , was packed with patients from the rio grande valley area
washington by the senate intelligence committee released wednesday concluded that the attack 16 months ago that killed four americans in benghazi , libya , could have been prevented , singling out the state department for criticism for its failure to bolster security in response to intelligence warnings about a growing security crisis around the city the report is broadly consistent with the findings of previous inquiries into the attack on sept 11 , 2012 , but it is the first public examination of a breakdown in communications between the state department and the cia during the weeks leading up to the deadly episode at the diplomatic compound where j christopher stevens , the american ambassador , died it is also the first report to implicitly criticize mr stevens , raising questions about his judgment and actions in the weeks before his death like previous inquiries , the senate investigation does not cite any specific intelligence warnings about an impending attack the events in benghazi and their aftermath became the subject of a fiercely partisan debate , with republicans accusing obama administration officials of making misleading statements about connections between the attackers and al qaeda in an addendum to the bipartisan report , republican committee members singled out former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , a possible democratic presidential candidate in 2016 , as bearing ultimate responsibility for lax security at the diplomatic compound in benghazi the report does not break significant new ground on the issue of administration statements about the episode , or on the infamous talking points drawn up after the attack for a television appearance by susan e rice , now the national security adviser but it is unsparing in its criticism of the state department for failing to provide adequate security to the mission even as violence spiked in benghazi in june 2012 in contrast , the report said , the cia quickly bolstered security at its annex about a mile away the committee found the attacks were preventable , based on extensive intelligence reporting on the terrorist activity in libya to include prior threats and attacks against western targets and given the known security shortfalls at the us mission , the senate committee said in in releasing the 58page declassified report together with the conclusions of previous investigations , the new senate findings are likely to increase pressure on patrick f kennedy , the under secretary of state for management , whose office oversees diplomatic security republicans on the committee noted that mr kennedy held a similar job in the prelude to the bombings of two american embassies in east africa in 1998 and should be held accountable for the benghazi tragedy on the contentious issue of the role of al qaeda or other international terrorist organizations in the attack on the diplomatic mission , the senate committee s report found that individuals affiliated with many such groups had participated in the attack but that none of them appeared to have planned or led the assault the report found that among the many terrorist groups with which individual attackers had some affiliation were ansar alshariah , al qaeda s north african affiliate al qaeda s yemenbased affiliate and an egyptian network led by muhammad jamal but the report said , intelligence suggests that the attack was not a highly coordinated plot , but was opportunistic it remains unclear if any group or person exercised overall command and control of the attacks or whether extremist group leaders directed their members to participate , the report said some intelligence suggests the attacks were likely put together in short order , following that day s violent protests in cairo against an inflammatory video the americanmade video , which denigrated islam and was posted on youtube , set off a number of protests across the middle east last month found that anger over the video had played a significant role in precipitating the benghazi attack the report notes that mr stevens was aware of all of the intelligence reporting on libya , including updates on the increased risks of antiwestern terrorist attacks that had prompted the cia to substantially upgrade the security at its own benghazi facility in june 2012 at times , mr stevens requested additional security personnel from the state department in washington but the inquiry also found that in june 2012 , around the time the threats were mounting , mr stevens recommended hiring and training local libyan guards to form security teams in tripoli and benghazi the plan showed a faith in local libyan support that proved misplaced on the night of the attack during an aug 15 , 2012 , meeting on the deteriorating security around benghazi that mr stevens attended , a diplomat stationed there described the situation as trending negatively , according to a cable sent the next day and quoted in the report a diplomatic security officer expressed concerns with the ability to defend post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower , security measures , weapons capabilities , host nation support , and the overall size of the compound a cia officer at the meeting pointed out the location of approximately 10 islamist militias and al qaeda training camps within benghazi , according to the same cable after reading the cable , gen carter f ham , then the commander of the united states africa command , called mr stevens to ask if the embassy in tripoli needed additional military personnel , potentially for use in benghazi , but stevens told ham it did not , the report said a short time later , general ham reiterated the offer at a meeting in germany , and stevens again declined , the report said the same aug 16 cable had also promised that requests for additional physical security upgrades and staffing needs for the benghazi mission would be submitted through the tripoli embassy , but the committee has not seen any evidence that those requests were passed on by the embassy , including by the ambassador , to state department headquarters before the sept 11 attacks in benghazi in the months before the attack , the committee found , american intelligence agencies gave ample warning about deteriorating security in benghazi and the risks to americans in the city the first intelligence report cited by the committee came in june 2012 , when the defense intelligence agency issued a report about threats to american and western interests the next month , a cia report said , al qaedaaffiliated groups and associates are exploiting the permissive security environment in libya to enhance their capabilities on sept 5 , 2012 , a week before the attack , the africa command issued a warning about a growing threat to americans , particularly in northeast libya as these warnings mounted , the cia bolstered its security at the agency s benghazi facility , known as the annex , but the state department did not make similar moves to protect the diplomatic compound in sum , the report concluded , the mission facility had a much weaker security posture than the annex , with a significant disparity in the quality and quantity of equipment and security upgrade communication between various security agencies was so poor , the report said , that the africa command did not know about the cia s annex the white house largely lined up behind the report s findings this reinforces what other investigations have found , a white house spokesman , jay carney , told reporters on wednesday the state department has been racing to fulfill 29 recommendations made in december 2012 by an independent review panel as part of its investigation into the attacks those include sending dozens of additional diplomatic security agents to highthreat embassies and installing millions of dollars in advanced firesurvival gear in response to the senate inquiry , the state department issued a status report of the changes recommended by the oversight panel , called the accountability review board a department spokeswoman , marie harf , said the report added little new information we should have been better then , and we need to get better going forward , ms harf said in one of her final appearances as secretary of state last year , mrs clinton took an approach before a senate committee that essentially was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in benghazi but not the blame a cia spokesman said the agency cooperated with the senate investigation and would review its recommendations
it is always a pleasure to check in on a happy marriage of musical artist and repertory after many years and find that it still thrives such is the report this week from avery fisher hall , where the veteran maestro is conducting the in mahler s elemental third symphony the first performance , on thursday evening , brought back cherished memories the fondest is that of a performance during a at the concertgebouw in amsterdam in 1995 , in which , over a couple of weeks , a stellar roster of conductors led the royal concertgebouw orchestra , the vienna philharmonic and the berlin philharmonic in all nine of the symphonies and other works by mahler mr haitink s account of the third symphony , with the vienna philharmonic , stands in distant recollection as the most memorable of the festival s outings an unforgettable combination of great symphony , great hall , great conductor and great orchestra that festival raised a in new york with its premise that the three big orchestras involved shared qualifications that no other ensemble could claim as martijn sanders , then the director of the concertgebouw , was quick to point out , each had a mahler tradition that was established by the composer himself , as conductor , and that had been assiduously maintained over the decades \( forget for the moment that the berlin philharmonic played no music by mahler , who was born jewish , from 1932 to 1948 the vienna philharmonic , none from 1938 to 1945 \) but what of the new york philharmonic , which mahler led as music director from 1909 to his death in 1911 , initiating a tradition that was repeatedly renewed by eminent mahlerians like willem mengelberg , john barbirolli , bruno walter , dimitri mitropoulos and leonard bernstein , to name just a few \? the implication , which mr sanders made explicit , was that despite such attentions , the philharmonic had somehow not adequately tended to its tradition well , the philharmonic was a stellar mahler orchestra then , and it can still be one at times , never more so than it was on thursday the players responded wholeheartedly to mr haitink s quiet , confident command , whether with a bold swagger in the huge thumping , brassy outbursts or with the utmost delicacy , as in the thread of sound sustained by the violas late in the surging finale that command was the only thing in real question before the performance , since mr haitink , 85 , has had serious heart and back problems in recent decades but he showed fine stamina and control throughout the work s nearly 100minute length of many fine solos within the orchestra , the associate principal trumpeter matthew muckey s offstage stint on the posthorn was especially eloquent the mezzosoprano bernarda fink sang the texts from nietzsche and des knaben wunderhorn beautifully , with depth of sound , spirit and clarity the brooklyn youth chorus \( directed by dianne berkunmenaker \) and the women of the new york choral artists \( directed by joseph flummerfelt \) filled out a worldclass performance
senator mitch mcconnell , the kentucky republican and minority leader , is up for reelection , and he is under pressure to show fealty to his state s powerful coal interests to that end , he introduced a resolution earlier this year to block a proposal by the environmental protection agency that would set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants as written , the proposal would effectively stop construction of most new coalfired plants like all proposed regulations , the epa s is subject to public comment and revision before it becomes final and under the congressional review act of 1996 , congress can only vote to overturn regulations , not proposed rules but none of that has stopped mr mcconnell from putting forward a resolution under the review law to block the epa proposal if the measure passes a long shot because it would be subject to a legal challenge and a presidential veto it could be used to derail federal rulemaking not only on greenhouse gas emissions but a range of issues , including food , drug and auto safety and even if it fails , mr mcconnell s ploy escalates already dangerous levels of antiregulatory fervor , while creating a template for playing politics with the regulatory process if democrats were to reject the emissions resolution on the solid grounds that the law does not allow for review of proposed regulations , mr mcconnell would invariably depict the vote as anticoal that , in turn , could invite other senators to play the same mischievous game , in hopes that a rejection of their antiregulatory resolution would be similarly misconstrued a no vote on a resolution to derail a workplace safety proposal , for instance , could be portrayed as a slap at small businesses a vote against a resolution to derail a food safety proposal could be depicted as antifarmer mr mcconnell has been relentless in using tactics to distort and nullify the processes that make government run for the sake of proper rulemaking as well as public health and safety , democrats cannot indulge him on this latest attempt
on july 4 , 1864 , four days after president abraham lincoln had surprised him by accepting his resignation , treasury secretary salmon p chase confided to his diary , i am too earnest , too antislavery and too radical chase surely possessed each of these attributes in excess but they had little to do with his unexpected exit from lincoln s team of rivals rather , it was much more personal chase s oftrepeated threat to quit had tested the forbearance of a beleaguered president once too often out of patience , lincoln ended his tenure with the observation that you and i have reached a point of mutual embarrassment in our official relation which it seems cannot be overcome , or longer sustained it had been an unlikely partnership from the start in 1860 , chase s presidential ambitions were second to none a staunch antislavery man , he had held a senate seat and the ohio governor s chair , and in one contemporary s words looked as you would wish a statesman to look a widower three times over , the aloof , pious chase had few friends , lived a life governed by unshakable routine , eagerly sought moral perfection and had no apparent sense of humor noted one contemporary , he knew little of human nature and was profoundly ignorant of men salmon chase , in short , was abraham lincoln s polar opposite the last of lincoln s three rivals for the presidency to be offered a cabinet post william h seward was named secretary of state and edward bates attorney general chase was initially inclined to decline the offer because lincoln had failed to tender me the treasury department with the same considerate respect which was manifested toward mr seward and mr bates he finally accepted in march 1861 chase proved a remarkably able and innovative manager of the union s finances he won congressional approval for a national banking system to provide a stable national currency and create a ready market for government bonds sale of the latter enabled the federal government to pay the staggering costs of over 3 billion \( over 5 trillion today \) for four years of fighting working with jay cooke company , chase managed the sale of 500 million in government bonds he also introduced the greenback demand note , the first federal currency chase s failings lay in his aspirations , not his performance convinced he was the ablest man in the cabinet , he also believed he was lincoln s superior as both an administrator and statesman his dream of occupying the white house never deserted him , and he sought to further his ambitions in ways small and large responsible for the design of paper currency , for example , he had no compunction about placing his own face on the 1 bill after all , he told one confidant , he had placed lincoln s on the 10 ! but chase s mischief could be more serious in the last months of 1862 , he played the major role in precipitating crises that twice threatened the fragile stability of lincoln s cabinet this much lauded team of rivals was in reality riven by clashes driven more by personality than ideology as the historian david donald has observed , chase and navy secretary gideon welles both distrusted seward , who they believed failed to grasp the dangers the war posed edwin m stanton , the secretary of war , was irascible and secretive , and worked well only with chase , with whom he enjoyed a 20year friendship welles father neptune to his colleagues as well as the president was a sometimes comical figure , while caleb smith , the interior secretary , seemed to all a figure of no account postmaster general montgomery blair bore particular animus toward chase and stanton , and seemed primarily selfinterested only bates enjoyed cordial relationships with all of his colleagues the stunning defeat of union gen john pope s army of virginia at the second battle of bull run in late august 1862 precipitated the first of these crises in league with stanton , chase tried to force lincoln to cashier gen george b mcclellan over his apparent refusal to reinforce pope s army in an extraordinary remonstrance to the president , they warned of the destruction of our armies should george b mcclellan be continued in command chase , stanton , smith and bates endorsed the document , while welles and blair expressed their support but chose not to sign it seward was out of town at a fractious cabinet meeting on sept 2 , the president overrode their objections while not unsympathetic to his cabinet secretaries concerns , lincoln argued that only mcclellan could reorganize the army and bring it out of chaos despite the union s success at antietam a few weeks later , lincoln did remove mcclellan from command of the army of the potomac in november , only to see his replacement , ambrose burnside , preside over a union debacle at fredericksburg news of this latest defeat provoked a mutiny among senate republicans , who were convinced \( due in no small part to chase s machinations \) that lincoln s management of the cabinet and embrace of seward s conservative ideas were hobbling the union war effort on dec 16 and 17 , 31 republican senators caucused to express their frustrations and anger with the lincoln administration , directing most of their venom at seward a concerned lincoln met with a delegation of nine republican senators for several hours on the nights of dec 18 and 19 , both to listen and to defend his administration with his cabinet members \( except seward , who had submitted his resignation \) in attendance at the second meeting , lincoln contended that while the cabinet did not meet regularly , it was informed of most major issues and generally acquiesced to the decisions that were made lincoln then put his treasury secretary , whom he knew to be at the bottom of all the mischief , on the spot would he support the president \? chase somewhat reluctantly said yes , but sought to save face with the senators present by noting that the cabinet was not asked to discuss many important issues the other cabinet members had little to say , and the meeting ended inconclusively , well after midnight the following morning lincoln summoned chase again , along with welles and stanton , because , he said , this matter is giving me great trouble chase responded that he had decided to resign seizing the letter from his hand , the president exclaimed , this cuts the gordian knot i can dispose of this subject now without difficulty i see my way clear his sameday refusal to accept the resignations of either chase or seward defused the crisis by signaling his willingness to listen to both moderate and radical republicans the cabinet crisis greatly diminished the treasury secretary s standing stanton confessed that he was ashamed of chase , while senator william p fessenden of maine \( who would succeed chase in the cabinet \) fulminated at the treasury secretary s deliberate sacrifice of his friends to the fear of offending his their enemies but chase s loss of face after the 1862 cabinet crisis did little to blunt his presidential aspirations he continued to fill the 15 , 000 patronage jobs at his disposal with loyalists and maintained a regular correspondence with supporters throughout the north well aware of these activities , lincoln had determined to shut his eyes to all these performances because chase made a good secretary the president also recognized that he had his treasury secretary under control , for chase could neither be overly critical within the cabinet nor resign and appear unpatriotic but chase continued to maneuver , and the battle looming over reconstruction policy in late 1863 and early 1864 bolstered his support among radicals unhappy with the administration it looked increasingly like chase might make a run for the white house early in 1864 , the campaign committee for chase headed by senator samuel c pomeroy of kansas , issued two pamphlets critical of lincoln too critical , in fact even lincoln s staunchest opponents found the publications too much , and the socalled pomeroy circular in particular which asserted that lincoln s candidacy was doomed proved so embarrassing to chase that he aggressively distanced himself from the piece but it wasn t enough the pamphlet , in one contemporary s words , had utterly annihilated the pretensions and prospects of mr chase within weeks his opponents coalesced in support of lincoln in the fall election , and chase announced that he would not be a candidate in the wake of these events , chase once again tendered his resignation in a long letter filled with selfjustifications by now , lincoln s fabled patience was threadbare his first response to chase s letter , a terse promise to answer a little more fully when i can find the leisure to do so , was followed six days later by a muted vote of confidence i do not perceive occasion for a change but the occasion for a change would soon arrive , prompted by the politics of patronage in late june 1864 , chase sought to replace a wellrespected assistant treasurer in new york with a clearly unqualified candidate of suspect political loyalty lincoln , fearing an open revolt among republicans , urged chase to select from among three alternative candidates chase rejected them and instead persuaded the incumbent to withdraw his resignation when chase sought a meeting with lincoln , he was rebuffed because the difficulty does not , in the main part , lie within the range of a conversation between you and me on june 29 , chase once again resigned and this time lincoln accepted i thought i could not stand it any longer , the president confided to his secretary john hay official washington was aghast at the news in congress and on the street there is a general feeling of depression and gloom , noted hay when the entire senate finance committee descended on the white house to protest , lincoln stood firm , reading to them each of chase s previous letters of resignation , as well as his responses , and noting that the tension between the two men had become such that they disliked to meet each other when gov john brough of ohio offered to mediate the dispute , lincoln replied , this is the third time he has thrown this at me , and i do not think i am called on to continue to beg him to take it back i reckon you had better let it alone this time chase s downfall proved short lived in december lincoln appointed him to the supreme court to succeed chief justice roger taney , who had died two months earlier in a letter to his fianc e , lincoln s other secretary , john nicolay , wrote that no other man than lincoln would have had the degree of magnanimity to thus forgive and exalt a rival who had so deeply and unjustifiably intrigued against him it is , he continued , only another illustration of the greatness of the president , in this age of little men follow disunion at or join us  sources michael

bolinas , calif late on saturday , feb 8 , news broke of the that had come through a northern california slaughterhouse social media buzzed with tweets and posts pronouncing it the latest example of a dysfunctional industrialized food system incapable of producing safe meat buy local ! know your farmer ! eat grassfed beef ! the problem was that this slaughterhouse , the rancho feeding corporation , did n't handle only commodity beef here , amid windswept pastures of coastal california in the epicenter of the nation s sustainable food movement , dozens of small and mediumscale farms and ranches , including mine , have been affected by the recall these are grassbased operations , many of them certified organic , whose owners have labored for decades to create a food stream that is humane , ecological and wholesome a rancho employee called the next morning with the news all the beef that had gone through the plant in 2013 was covered no exceptions every ounce of meat remaining in the public food supply had to be turned back in all of it would be destroyed the slaughterhouse provided no further information an agriculture department said the recall was necessary because the facility processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection thus , the products are adulterated there was no suggestion of any plantwide contamination , and it noted that there were no cases of human illness associated with any of the beef the agriculture department has refused requests for more information , citing a continuing investigation by its inspector general we operate a small meat company supplied exclusively by our ranch and nine other ranches that all follow the same protocols complying with the recall would mean destroying over 100 , 000 pounds of meat we had intentionally frozen throughout the year to extend our beef season our beef comes from grassfed cattle we never use hormones we feed no drugs we know the complete history of each animal , from the identity of its mother to where it spent each day of its life and we knew that all our own cattle received full federal inspections at the slaughterhouse , both ante and postmortem while it s painful to see our beautiful animals die , my husband , bill , or our cattle manager has always accompanied every single one to the slaughterhouse stunning area being handled by a familiar person reassures the animals and guarantees that none is ever mistreated we have advocated that everyone raising livestock do the same we are involved with each of the federal inspections as well of live animals , whole carcasses , lymph glands and internal organs we observe and record , at every stage , details about the condition of each carcass and the viscera these protocols are laborintensive , but the data is invaluable in early identification of quality problems and for assessing which lineages provide the best beef those carcasses are cut in quarters and then transported from the slaughterhouse to a federally certified processing plant here again , before butchering , each carcass is inspected by both agriculture department employees and us why were our rigorous procedures insufficient to keep us out of the recall \? the agriculture department s tools for safeguarding the nation s meat supply are blunt and clumsy instruments , especially when dealing with independent farmers in a battle between the slaughterhouse and the federal agency over proper inspections for animals in its commodity meat business , it was apparently decided that it would be simpler and more convenient to conduct a blanket recall we and about 35 other farming and ranching families are the collateral damage beyond the immediate financial strain caused by the recall , it threatens the very existence of the bay area s smallerscale grassfed and organic farms the facility involved was the only remaining bay area slaughterhouse , and there are just a handful in all of northern california now the recall has precipitated the slaughterhouse s closure without it , ranchers will be forced to either transport their cattle hundreds of miles for slaughter or exit the business people love supporting local food and farms but when was the last time you saw someone wearing a tshirt that said support local slaughterhouses \? but if we want to eat eggs , dairy and meat , we must come to terms with the need for good slaughter facilities available to all farmers from 1979 to 2009 , california went from having 70 slaughterhouses to 23 because it is more complicated and costly to do so , nearly all large facilities refuse to work with smaller farms this makes slaughtering the most serious bottleneck in the sustainable food chain congress should require all slaughterhouses to open their doors to local farmers , perhaps one day a week and the agriculture department should assist in establishing and maintaining smallerscale slaughterhouses in every region understaffing of foodsafety inspectors may have played a role in the recall stan painter , president of the national joint council of food inspection locals , and may not have had time to properly examine all of rancho s meat that makes it an apt time to require video cameras throughout every slaughterhouse tapes would be made available to meat inspectors , and regularly handed over to the agriculture department as part of its oversight the idea is not farfetched cameras in slaughter facilities are already commonplace in britain in 2005 , a united states senate committee recommended requiring slaughterhouses to install cameras to ensure humane animal handling as recently as 2008 , the agriculture department gave the idea serious consideration if cameras were installed at all key inspection points , it could also help people like us prove that the meat received full , proper inspections the way we track each animal is rare in the food industry but the technology to follow an individual animal from birth to slaughter exists and is relatively inexpensive if all animals were routinely tracked , a recall like this could be a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer our company is appealing the agriculture department s decision to include us in this blanket recall if allowed to stand , it will be financially devastating for us and for many other farming and ranching families but even more abhorrent is the waste we took the lives of our animals to feed people being forced to throw away their meat would be sacrilege
dallas the ebola patient in a hospital is fighting for his life , but he remains the only confirmed victim of the disease in the united states , and public health officials remain confident about their ability to contain the disease , the director of the centers for disease control and prevention said sunday while expressing such confidence about the american effort , the director , dr thomas r frieden , said on the cnn program state of the union that in africa , the virus is spreading so fast that it s hard to keep up dr frieden said that the condition of the patient in dallas , a liberian man named thomas e duncan , was quite critical , having been changed on saturday from serious we understand that his situation has taken a turn for the worse , he said at a news conference in atlanta sunday afternoon officials here continued to scramble to contain the spread of the disease , monitor those mr duncan came into contact with and decontaminate the dallas apartment where he had been staying with his girlfriend and three of her relatives on sunday , city and county officials said they had found a homeless man who was among those being monitored the man rode in the ambulance that took mr duncan to the hospital , before the vehicle was taken out of service and cleaned officials said the man , whom they identified as michael lively , had been monitored saturday , was asymptomatic , and apparently went into hiding on sunday before he was found prosecutors here are considering whether to bring charges against mr duncan following reports that he had contact with a woman who ended up dying of ebola in liberia and later lied about that contact before boarding a plane to the united states we are actively having discussions as to whether or not we need to look into this as it relates to a criminal matter , dallas county s district attorney , craig watkins , said on lone star politics on nbc 5 on sunday we 're working with all the different agencies to get to the bottom of it his spokeswoman said prosecutors had previously filed aggravated assault charges against people who were hiv positive and knowingly had unprotected sex with others and it was possible the same charge may apply in mr duncan s case at the apartment where mr duncan and the others had been staying , about 20 containers were filled with linens and other items the containers were being stored in an extremely safe and secure location , and guarded by dallas county sheriff s deputies , sana syed , a city spokeswoman , said the potentially contaminated medical waste that has been generated so far at the hospital , like bedsheets , gowns and gloves , has been incinerated the four people who had been living in the apartment mr duncan s girlfriend , one of her children and two

virus and is subject to prosecution when he returns to the country the chairman of the liberia airport authority said that when mr duncan flew out of roberts international airport in monrovia , the liberian capital , on sept 19 , he answered no to a question about whether he had contact with any person infected with ebola in the last 21 days , the maximum period of incubation for ebola in addition , texas health presbyterian said mr duncan was asked by nurses if he had been around anyone who had been ill when he first went to the emergency room there on sept 25 , and mr duncan told them he had not both of those answers appeared to be contradicted by mr duncan s activities in the days before he left liberia for the united states in monrovia , neighbors and the parents of marthalene williams , 19 , a woman who died of ebola , said mr duncan had helped the family take her to and from a hospital on sept 15 shortly before she died some of the men and women who had direct

went to the emergency room feeling ill on sept 25 he returned to the hospital three days later on sept 28 after his condition worsened it was unclear how the threat of charges being filed against mr duncan will be viewed by african immigrants in the dallas area liberians have already been on edge about coming into contact with anyone who may have come into contact with mr duncan stanley gaye , president of the liberian community association of dallasfort worth , said some liberian immigrants had told him they were concerned about being tested for ebola because they feared being placed in

moscow and are now at war at least 2 , 200 people have died in the conflict thousands more may die yet the western powers america , europe , now have no good options , but they cannot do nothing president has left us with two dire choices , both fraught with risk either we arm ukraine , or we force kiev to surrender and let mr putin carve whatever territories he wants into a russianoccupied zone of frozen conflict it is a stark choice , and mr putin is not rational any rational leader would have reeled from the cost of western sanctions russia s economy is being hit hard by a credit crunch , capital flight , spiraling inflation and incipient recession this will hurt mr putin s surging popularity at home but none of this has deterred the smirking enigma ukraine cannot win this war mr putin has made it clear that the russian army will annihilate ukrainian forces if they attempt to liberate donetsk and luhansk ukraine s ramshackle army cannot rout the crack troops and conscript forces of an oilfueled giant the west needs to be honest with ukraine we talk as though this country were one of us as if , one day , it will become a member of the and the nato alliance that is kiev s wish , but the west is not giving ukraine the means to fight this war ukraine is being destroyed the economy is in tatters the military will not survive a russian offensive ukrainians are taking refuge in romantic nationalism and preparing for partisan warfare the costs are mounting continuing to fight will cost thousands of lives and the liberal dreams of the revolution are drowning in the jingoistic fury and hysteria of war a few more months without meaningful western help and ukraine will have lost the fighting core of its army and its infatuation with the west this will be replaced by a sense of betrayal , and there will be no way for ukraine s proeuropean liberals to survive the backlash the farright extremists now on the fringe will ride into kiev s parliament on the lids of the caskets being shipped back from the front ukraine will become a ravaged conflict zone a european syria , or a hideously enlarged bosnia we cannot let this happen if we believe that ukraine will one day become a member of the european union and nato , then we should be ready to arm it we must face the fact that the costs of unlimited european union and nato expansion have meant war with russia by proxy and then fight the war having reignited the hottest moments of the cold war , we must deal with the consequences of encouraging democratization in eastern europe this logic demands that we send western military advisers to kiev , and give the ukrainians full intelligence and satellite support and we must ship them guns , tanks , drones and medical kits by the ton we must even be ready to deploy nato troops if russian tanks roll toward crimea , as many fear they will , to build a land bridge to the mainland of southern russia no question , this path involves enormous risks russia will throw its might into ukraine american and british special forces should be dispatched to plant the flag and protect the airports of kiev and odessa but mr putin may call our bluff russian forces might in an echo of the 1999 kosovo war encircle them but if we are not prepared to take these risks , then we must force the ukrainians to abandon their deadly delusion it would be up to us to prevent russia from slaughtering ukrainian conscripts in vain the only way to achieve this is for the west to oblige ukraine to surrender ukraine is completely dependent on the , which is western money we must tell kiev to accept as a fait accompli that russia has carved out a south ossetia in the east or we turn the money off we can console them being another georgia is not the worst thing in the world we could save thousands of lives this way , but it would be a crushing defeat for the west russia would have restored itself as an empire the former soviet union once more under the sway of the kremlin the west would thus concede , in effect , that russia may invade or annex any of these territories as it pleases and in these lands , the appeasers would flourish , and democracy wilt russia would have triumphed over the world order imposed by the west after the soviet union lost the cold war this would mean the destruction of american geopolitical deterrence america s enemies , from china to iran , would see this as an invitation to establish their own spheres of influence amid the wreckage russia would not stop there mr putin wants to undermine nato , and the smell of weakness would tempt him further it would be merely a matter of time before moscow exploited the russians in the baltic states to manufacture new frozen conflicts poland would feel compelled to act as though nato did not exist , creating a defensive military alliance of its own with the baltics it might even establish a buffer zone in western ukraine there is no easy way out now but we must not let thousands of ukrainians die because we dithered we must be honest with them if we are not willing to fight a new cold war with russia over ukrainians' independence but if we force ukraine to surrender , rather than sacrifice lives in a fight for which we have no stomach , then we must accept that it is a surrender , too , for nato , for europe and liberal democracy , and for american global leadership that is the choice before us

ramat gan , israel aside from the sixfigure price tag , what was striking was just how easy it was for ophira dorin to buy a kidney two years ago , as she faced the dispiriting prospect of spending years on dialysis , ms dorin set out to find an organ broker who could help her bypass israel s lengthy transplant wait list only 36 , she had a promising job at a software company and dreams of building a family to a woman who raced cars for kicks , it seemed unthinkable that her best days might be tethered to a soulsapping machine for five years , ms dorin had managed her kidney disease by controlling her diet , but it had gradually overrun her resistance unable to find a matching donor among family and friends , she faced a daily battle against nausea , exhaustion and depression a broker who trades in human organs might seem a difficult thing to find but ms dorin s mother began making inquiries around the hospital where she worked , and in short order the family came up with three names avigad sandler , a former insurance agent long suspected of trafficking boris volfman , a young ukrainian migr and sandler prot g and yaacov dayan , a wily businessman with interests in real estate and marketing the men were , the new york times learned during an investigation of the global organ trade , among the central operators in israel s irrepressible underground kidney market for years , they have pocketed enormous sums for arranging overseas transplants for patients who are paired with foreign donors , court filings and government documents show the brokers maintain they operate legally and do not directly help clients buy organs dodging international condemnation and tightening enforcement , they have nimbly shifted operations across the globe when any one destination closes its doors the supply of transplantable organs is by the world health organization to meet no more than a tenth of the need although there is no reliable data , experts say thousands of patients most likely receive illicit transplants abroad each year almost always , the sellers are poor and illinformed about the medical risks the vast marketplace includes the united states , where federal prosecutors in new jersey won the for illegal brokering in 2011 but a times analysis of major trafficking cases since 2000 suggests that israelis have played a disproportionate role that is in part because of religious strictures regarding death and desecration that have kept deceased donation rates so low that some patients feel they must turn elsewhere when someone needs an organ transplant , they 'll do everything in their power , said meir broder , a top legal adviser to israel s ministry of health that desperation was evident in the workings of the transplant tourism pipeline that delivered ms dorin and other foreign patients to costa rica from 2009 to 2012 through more than 100 interviews and reviews of scores of documents , the times traced the network from the barrios of san jos , costa rica s gritty capital , to the glass towers of ramat gan , a bustling commercial district near tel aviv the costa rican government is not sure how many foreigners received suspicious transplants there but the times identified 11 patients six israelis , three greeks and two american residents who traveled to san jos for transplants using kidneys obtained from locals two other israelis who were located brought donors from israel with them for procedures that most likely would not have been approved in their own country the network was built by a cast that included highrolling israeli brokers , a prominent costa rican nephrologist and middlemen who recruited donors from the driver s seat of a taxi and the front counter of a pizzeria in interviews and documents , four israeli patients or sources close to them identified mr dayan , known as koby , as their conduit to costa rica the authorities in costa rica have been investigating the operation for more than a year but it is not clear that the police in either country have linked the transplants to mr dayan or other israeli brokers none of the organ recipients contacted by the times said they had been interviewed ms dorin s path through the organ bazaar was circuitous , taking her to multiple brokers doing business on opposite sides of the world the odyssey began when her family was referred to avigad sandler , who explained that he was sending clients to sri lanka for 200 , 000 in cash , ms dorin said her coworkers staged a fundraiser , and her parents mortgaged their house to cover the rest when ms dorin s mother went to convert her shekels into dollars , the moneychanger told her that his uncle had received a kidney in sri lanka for far less he offered to arrange an introduction the uncle s broker , boris volfman , requested 10 , 000 down and told ms dorin she would have to take the remaining 140 , 000 to sri lanka he suggested she change her dollars into 500euro notes to keep the wad thin , she said the timing was unfortunate the next day , the israel police arrested mr volfman , along with mr sandler and others , on suspicions of organ trafficking unrelated to ms dorin s case the setback did not last long when ms dorin mentioned her plight to a client , he told her that his father had received a transplant in turkey five years before why did n't you come to me earlier \? he asked a meeting was arranged with mr dayan , who explained that a transplant in costa rica would cost 175 , 000 , ms dorin said he was careful not to specify that the package would include a kidney but it was understood , ms dorin recalled , that the payment was for everything , including the organ she said that some of the money was wired to a hospital in san jos , and that she delivered a payment to dr francisco jos mora palma , the kidney specialist who oversaw her transplant dr mora then paid the equivalent of 18 , 500 to an unemployed 37yearold man for his kidney , according to a confidential costa rican court document just hours after ms dorin arrived in san jos in june 2012 , dr mora met with her and the donor at her hotel there , she said , they signed affidavits in spanish , a language she could not read , swearing that money would not change hands ms dorin said she had doubts about mr dayan s assurances that everything was legal , but did not feel she had much choice my situation was critical , she said i did n't feel very good , and my condition was getting worse even if i knew it was illegal , i do n't think i would have done anything different it s important to understand that these people , although greedy , do save lives because most people can live with only one kidney , that organ accounts for the vast majority of livingdonor transplants laparoscopy has made the surgery to remove a kidney fairly routine , although it is not riskfree living donors account for about 40 percent of the roughly 80 , 000 kidney transplants performed worldwide each year , according to the who patients fortunate enough to find a living donor with the right blood type and antigens can avoid the lengthy wait for an organ from a cadaver kidneys from living donors are also preferred because they tend to last longer long criminalized across the globe , the organ trade was handed an unequivocal rebuke at a worldwide conference of transplant practitioners in 2008 the group s manifesto , called the , asserted that trafficking violated the principles of equity , justice and respect for human dignity and should be prohibited and yet the prospective market for trafficked kidneys has grown unabated as the gap between supply and demand widens each year in the united states , the number of kidney transplants has remained static for a decade at 16 , 000 to 17 , 000 a year during the same period , the waiting list for kidneys from deceased donors has nearly doubled , passing 100 , 000 this year the median wait time for an adult is more than four years , and more than 4 , 000 die waiting each year some physicians and ethicists question the relative morality of allowing thousands to die just because the means of saving them is considered repugnant a regulated marketplace , they say , could all but eliminate the shortage it is no accident , they argue , that the only country that allows compensation for donors iran  experts list china , egypt , india , pakistan , sri lanka , turkey , eastern europe and the former soviet republics as hot spots for organ trafficking but illicit transplants usually go undetected unless there is a surgical mistake or a payment dispute prosecutions are thwarted by false affidavits , toothless laws and lack of international cooperation , particularly regarding extradition over the last decade , the authorities have pursued only a handful of cases worldwide few have sidelined the brokers , who seem bolder than ever some , like mr volfman , who leases office space atop a mirrored skyscraper in ramat gan , have moved out of the shadows they brazenly ply their trade even while under police scrutiny , posting facebook photos of the luxury cars and fivestar hotel rooms they rent on the road the times found that brokers in recent years typically have charged clients 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 to cover expenses associated with a transplant as with other scarce luxuries , pricing can be elastic in 2012 , an 83yearold texas car dealer , john w wiesner , paid 330 , 000 to mr sandler to arrange a transplant in sri lanka , israeli court documents show in an email that april , mr sandler told mr wiesner he was being charged extra due to the high risk posed by his age , which would have disqualified him at most american hospitals mr wiesner did not have his own donor if the details are acceptable , please wire 40 , 000 usd to the following bank account , mr sandler instructed mr wiesner s trip to sri lanka was preempted by mr sandler s arrest the next month the israel police found 150 , 000 of mr wiesner s money and returned it , according to court filings he then sued mr sandler and others to recover the rest the case was settled in march for 66 , 000 , court records show mr wiesner and his lawyers declined to comment mr sandler , 65 , a former israeli army officer , had come under suspicion back in 2008 when european union prosecutors investigated a trafficking network in kosovo numerous attempts to contact him through lawyers and relatives were unsuccessful with its lush rain forests and breathtaking beaches , costa rica had been a vacation destination long before the development of its medical tourism industry but by 2012 , about 50 , 000 visitors were spending 330 million a year on procedures as varied as root canals and tummy tucks , according to the as revenues soared , the transplant trade revealed itself as the seamy underside physicians have a financial incentive to treat foreign patients because of the country s dual publicprivate medical system specialists like nephrologists and transplant surgeons are required to work at staterun hospitals , where they make perhaps 7 , 000 a month but they can earn more by working after hours at private hospitals that cater to patients with means there , doctors are paid by the case , so the more transplants they perform , the more they make one nephrologist in san jos , dr jos fernando mangel morales , said he sometimes doubled his monthly income by handling a single transplant at a private hospital dr mora , the chief of nephrology at the staterun hospital rafael ngel calder n guardia , also had privileges at two private hospitals hospital cl nica b blica and hospital la cat lica the costa rican authorities believe he had been arranging transplants for foreigners at the hospitals at least since 2009 the doctor , now 64 , was considered a pioneer within the country s small nephrology community , assisting in more than 550 transplants over a 35year career by 2011 , the foreign market had become important enough that he appeared in a promotional video in the united states , he said in thickly accented english , a kidney transplant might cost 250 , 000 here in costa rica , he said , it would cost more or less a third part , including the hotel and the ticket for the planes dr mora recruited other doctors with promises of a sweet payday in 2012 , he tried to entice dr clive montalbertsmith , a retired surgeon , to perform transplants on israeli patients at hospital la cat lica diez millones por los dos transplantes , una semana de trabajo , dr mora texted ten million colones \( about 18 , 500 today \) for two transplants , one week of work he said it was nothing dishonest , dr montalbertsmith said in an interview in san jos , that lawyers had written papers , that they are not paid donors but if a foreigner comes here and the donor does n't know him and says he is an altruistic donor , the chance that it is trafficking is very high i told him , no thanks' it was n't easy to refuse dr mora did not respond to repeated requests for an interview , and his lawyer declined to comment the costa ricans who provided kidneys to foreigners were mainly men who had not finished high school and were either unemployed or held lowincome jobs two of the donations were arranged by dimosthenis katsigiannis , a greek immigrant to costa rica , according to a searchandseizure order obtained by the times mr katsigiannis , 56 , owns the akropolis pizzeria , which at the time was across from the public hospital where dr mora worked according to his lawyer , mr katsigiannis received a call in 2009 from a relative who needed a transplant he inquired among the doctors who frequented his restaurant and was directed to dr mora then he let it be known that he was shopping for a donor the 38yearold man who offered his services for about 5 , 500 was so satisfied that his older brother sought out a comparable deal , said mr katsigiannis s lawyer , jes s gilberto corella quesada mr corella said that mr katsigiannis received no compensation the brothers received their payments at the pizzeria , according to the search order obviously there was some money involved , mr corella said nobody would donate , except if they were related or a friend , without being paid he disputed the brothers' affidavits vowing that they took no money subsequent sellers were recruited by maureen cordero solano , 33 , a police officer who drove a taxi after hours , according to the authorities like many who fall into organ brokering , ms cordero had sold her own kidney in 2009 and met dr mora in the process she received 1 , 000 from him for each donor she supplied , according to the search order she could not be reached , and her lawyer would not comment some of the donors were solicited in ms cordero s cab she finds out they have an economic need and tells them there s a way they can get a good amount of money , said jorge chavarr a guzm n , the chief prosecutor in costa rica then she puts them in contact with dr mora mr dayan , now in his late 50s , had been one of israel s goto transplant brokers long before he began directing patients to costa rica a favorite destination had been the philippines until it banned transplants for foreigners in 2008 according to a taxfraud indictment issued in israel last year , mr dayan and his firm used dummy foreign companies to shield more than 30 million from 1999 to 2007 , much of it from transplant brokering the indictment charges that mr dayan paid associates up to 40 , 000 for each donor they recruited , often through ads in russianlanguage newspapers by 2011 , he had opened operations in costa rica he told me he has a contract with dr mora , that he was exclusive with him for israelis , said one israeli who met with mr dayan that year he told me he already sent several people and everything was successful the israeli insisted on anonymity for fear of retribution through documents and interviews , the times traced the transplants for ms dorin and two other israelis back to mr dayan one , a 60yearold retiree , identified mr dayan as his broker in a lawsuit seeking repayment of a loan a fourth client sued mr dayan after plans for a transplant fell through that court file includes an email from mr dayan to dr mora , dated nov 15 , 2011 , trying to schedule two transplants mr dayan acknowledged during a brief interview in his office that he knew dr mora but he denied sending patients to costa rica no chance , he said with a smile wearing a gray suit and sporting a saltandpepper goatee , mr dayan said he had heard from a patient that dr mora was connecting costa rican donors with israeli recipients i told dr mora he was making mistakes that he took patients from outside costa rica , mr dayan said he declined to explain further i have n't been in the business for a year and a half or two years , he said we help people , but i do n't want to talk about it i think this is going to make problems for patients a spokesman for the israel police declined to comment on whether the agency was pursuing the costa rica case although limited in scope , research suggests that patients who go abroad for transplants may bear higher risks of complications and lower rates of survival in costa rica , at least two of the recipients had dangerous outcomes , including an israeli businessman who underwent a transplant at hospital la cat lica on nov 30 , 2012 the procedure , which was overseen by dr mora and dr victor hugo monge monge , a vascular surgeon , left the businessman with impaired kidney function and grotesque abdominal swelling , according to emails among physicians in extremis , he flew to los angeles and checked into ronald reagan ucla medical center , where he was stabilized now 55 , the businessman is back working full time interviewed in a tel aviv cafe on the condition that he not be named , he denied paying for anything other than the airfare and lodging of his donor he said he chose not to have the transplant at home because he assumed that in israel , they would not believe that this donor came without money the first clue that something was amiss in costa rica came in august 2012 when a nurse at the public hospital where dr mora worked learned that its surgical equipment was being used at hospital la cat lica for a transplant then in december 2012 , dr gabriel danovitch , the nephrologist at ucla who treated the israeli businessman , told a costa rican doctor about his suspicions of trafficking the chief prosecutor s office in costa rica was subsequently notified , as were health officials there and in israel yet , costa rica s investigation did not ramp up until after a bizarre episode on march 18 , 2013 , when a costa rican couple arrived at ben gurion airport , near tel aviv rosa , then 20 , and roberto , 26 , were from the central highlands , where the lush volcanic hillsides are planted thick with sugar cane and coffee \( the times is not publishing their last names because they are considered protected witnesses under costa rican law \) neither had been out of the country , nor on a plane , so they were brimming with excitement tomorrow i start a new stage of my life , thank you god for helping me , roberto posted on facebook before leaving i hope all will go well a unique and beautiful trip will happen instead , the couple caught the attention of the border police after deplaning with one piece of luggage , little money and plans only to meet a stranger at the exit , said rodrigo x carreras jim nez , the costa rican ambassador to israel with rosa in tears , the israelis held the couple until they could be deported the next morning they finally confessed that they had come here to sell a kidney , of the young lady , mr carreras said they also mentioned that dr mora was their handler rosa and roberto , when contacted in costa rica , declined to grant a full interview during brief exchanges , they said they did not know why they had been sent to israel when the routine had been for recipients to travel to costa rica we did n't know anything about anything , rosa said what they did know was financial distress they had borrowed nearly 3 , 000 from a friend and were having trouble paying it back roberto made about 500 a month as a security guard , and rosa was finishing high school they had a baby to feed and were living in a tinroofed shanty beside a fetid stream one day , roberto said , he received a visit from a relative , ms cordero , the taxi driver who recruited donors she offered a way out a lady needs to live , and you need the money , she said when medical tests disqualified roberto , rosa stepped up the scene at the airport only got stranger when a nurse arrived asking to take rosa s blood , according to mr carreras a lawyer also showed up , and along with the nurse was sent away the lawyer , lior lev , said in an interview that a client , whom he would not name , had dispatched him to check on the couple court records show that mr lev has represented mr dayan in other matters crestfallen , rosa and roberto flew home back in san jos , unease about the foreign transplants was starting to bubble , even as new players sought a piece of the business dr jorge cort s rodr guez , the medical director of cl nica b blica , was already nervous about the four transplants performed at his hospital by dr mora s team when the doctor asked to schedule another one the prior procedures had been approved by hospital officials who accepted patients' affidavits at face value when you studied the paperwork , brought by a prestigious doctor with a team behind him , dr cort s said , and you saw it was perfect with the legal stamps and the authorizations by the attorneys , you do n't think anything is wrong but when it happens one time and it happens another time , then you start to get suspicious on april 18 , dr cort s informed dr mora that he would not approve the transplant dr mora took the news calmly but dr cort s soon received a visit in his office from a musclebound man with thick black hair that was shaved in a fade he introduced himself in slavicaccented english as damian goldstein the visitor , whom dr cort s took to be a broker , demanded an explanation for the cancellation he started pushing me hard , dr cort s recalled , saying that we need to do this for humanitarian reasons , that the patient is in very bad shape the visitor backed down , but the encounter left dr cort s shaken he really impressed me that he looked like a bad boy , he said damian goldstein is a pseudonym used by a 30yearold israeli named adi vladlen lishinski , the times has determined from documents and interviews while in san jos , mr lishinski sublet a twobedroom flat on the 17th floor of the country s tallest building , where he made daily use of the gym and blared rock n' roll , according to building staff members in a photograph posted on his facebook page , he is seen surveying san jos from the balcony , barechested and tattooed , sunglasses in place despite foreboding gray skies mr lishinski had immigrated to israel from ukraine as a child he began building a modest criminal record as a teenager , and by october 2011 , he had jumped bail in a robbery case he spent time in sri lanka and then , according to immigration records , arrived in san jos on oct 10 , 2012 shortly after , mr lishinski stopped at a car dealership the 20 , 000 he had to spend was not enough to buy the grand cherokee that caught his eye but during several visits , he struck up enough of a relationship with the salesman , carlos z iga forero , to reveal what had brought him to san jos he said he was making a living selling organs , mr z iga said he said it was legal because the people sign some papers mr lishinski explained that he hoped to establish a transplant tourism agency , but needed a local partner to incorporate under costa rican law flashing 100 bills , he offered mr z iga several thousand dollars to sign on the salesman declined but referred mr lishinski to a pair of lawyers one of them , federico altamura arce , cosigned incorporation papers for d b medical treatment solutions on nov 5 , 2012 , for a 1 , 000 fee a notary required identification , and mr lishinski submitted a copy of a passport bearing his real name mr lishinski then wanted more templates for contracts with hospitals and fillintheblank affidavits for donors but mr altamura soon discovered that his client had been misleading him about the legalities of donation in israel in a meeting , the lawyers told mr lishinski they were no longer comfortable representing him it did not sit well mr lishinski demanded to know who they were to question him when the transplants had been approved by dr mora he insulted me at one point and told me , to quote him , that i did n't have balls because i would n't do the document for him , mr altamura said said i was a coward i responded that as an attorney i have the right to choose what risks to take mr lishinski departed costa rica in late april 2013 , and was arrested in the robbery case when he landed at ben gurion , court records show a judge ordered him to perform community service at a nursing home , and to pay modest fines it could not be determined whether mr lishinski arranged any transplants , or was associated with mr dayan but the times learned through interviews that mr lishinski is a longtime friend of boris volfman they met as teenagers in a residential program for wayward juveniles in northern israel , according to a mutual acquaintance in march , a reporter reached mr lishinski by telephone and asked to discuss his work have you talked with mr boris \? he replied beyond that , mr lishinski declined to detail his overseas activities actually , i do n't have any involvement in costa rica or sri lanka , he said mr volfman , however , granted a series of lengthy telephone interviews while acknowledging that he and mr lishinski had business dealings , he denied that his friend had worked for him in costa rica the answer is no , clearly and completely no , mr volfman said he acted by himself without any connection to me mr volfman was otherwise circumspect about their association we 're trying to cooperate in a number of fields , trying to do something together , he said mr volfman , 30 , personifies the generational evolution of the transplant tourism trade two years ago , after his arrest with mr sandler , he set up his own agency he consulted with lawyers about insulating the firm , put up a website \( justsavelivescom \) and issued news releases in search of markets he named his company leshem shamaim , or in the name of heaven it s god s work , mr volfman explained patients like ms dorin said they found the youthful mr volfman to be selfconfident , earnest and smoothly reassuring photographs on social media depict him with piercing blue eyes , a shag of jet black hair and a distinctive tattoo that drapes his right shoulder married with a young son , he owns a condominium overlooking the mediterranean in ashdod , south of tel aviv mr volfman sold his own kidney in colombia as a young man , according to court records he said that while working for mr sandler , he accompanied patients to sri lanka but he denied that they dealt in trafficked organs in 2007 , mr volfman was charged in the abduction of a man who told the police that mr volfman had used him to hack into hospital databases in search of kidney patients mr volfman pleaded guilty to reduced charges and was sentenced to two months in jail , according to court records his name emerged again when european union prosecutors investigated organ trafficking in kosovo that led to mr volfman s twoweek detention in israel in may 2012 four months after leaving jail , mr volfman incorporated leshem shamaim he said the company , with six employees , had handled perhaps 15 transplants in its first 18 months in the interviews , conducted in march while mr volfman said he was traveling in europe , he explained that for about 30 , 000 , the firm would accompany clients abroad and provide contacts , medical testing , transport , lodging and translation but mr volfman said patients decided which transplant centers to engage , and paid them directly in our company , we do n't have any contact with the organ , he said all we can do is obligate the client to make sure that this is not something that has to do with organ trafficking if a person decides to break the law , that s between that person and the law regardless , leshem shamaim s aggressive pursuit of new venues has raised red flags on several continents in april 2013 , one of mr volfman s employees wrote to the peruvian health ministry to say that leshem shamaim would pay 10 , 000 per transplant if the firm was granted exclusive rights to bring patients to lima the ministry s lawyers concluded in a memo that such an arrangement would violate the country s antitrafficking laws two months later , the leshem shamaim representative emailed a similar solicitation to officials in singapore the letter prompted the head of nephrology at national university hospital to caution her colleagues i think they are on the prowl for commercial transplants on june 18 , 2013 , costa rican police officers raided hospital calder n guardia and made a show of arresting dr mora while he was still dressed in his white lab coat the organismo de investigaci n judicial , costa rica s fbi , also arrested ms cordero , the taxi driver , and seized medical records from dr mora s offices the doctor was jailed for four months before paying bail of about 180 , 000 scheduled to retire soon , he did not return to work a close friend , dr manuel cerdas calder n , the president of costa rica s nephrology society , visited dr mora in jail he said they did the kidney transplants to save lives , dr cerdas said that is the only reason dr mora has lost many things money , patients , his position , prestige he can never come back the records seized from dr mora led the authorities to multiple kidney sellers and prompted the arrests in october of dr monge , the vascular surgeon who transplanted the organs , and of the two urologists who removed them the suspects declined to comment the police also swept into the akropolis pizzeria and arrested mr katsigiannis formal charges against him , dr mora and the three other doctors are expected this month , said tatiana vargas vindas , a spokeswoman for the chief prosecutor the government will not charge ms cordero because she is cooperating with prosecutors it will also not pursue those who sold kidneys , ms vargas said they are considered victims and have been placed in a government protection program nobody is in good condition monetary , social or health , said henry madrigal ledezma , head of the trafficking unit of the organismo de investigaci n judicial nobody is attending to them , no hospital , no doctor top officials at hospital la cat lica , where most of the transplants took place , did not respond to requests for comment cl nica b blica said in a statement that it could not have suspected that donors and recipients would arrange transplants based on false statements and forged agreements the scandal prompted the costa rican legislative assembly to pass a law in march that toughens the restrictions on trafficking , holds doctors accountable for illicit procedures and establishes a national waitlist system in israel , the state attorney s office declined to discuss the status of the taxfraud case against mr dayan there are no formal charges against mr sandler , mr volfman and their associates , but the office continues to investigate with the intention of seeking indictments the noose seemed to tighten in april when the israel police arrested one of mr volfman s lieutenants at a detention hearing , a police superintendent , meir arenfeld , said that the primary suspect in the operation presumably mr volfman was abroad and from what we understand , has no intention of coming back he said the police and prosecutors were examining transplants arranged by leshem shamaim in turkey late last year , israeli nephrologists noticed that kidney recipients were returning from ankara one of them bore medical records forwarded by a leshem shamaim employee it is clear to us that these people sold their bodies for pennies , mr arenfeld said of the donors he said that prior arrests had not seemed to deter the brokers , adding , we see a pattern of behavior that is repeating itself
are foreign companies engaging in monopolistic practices in china , colluding with one another to hike up prices and engage in other unfair tricks \? the chinese government seems to believe so more and more foreign companies are being raided or investigated on these grounds , most recently microsoft the issue goes to the heart of free trade and comes as china itself is pursuing economic changes aimed at shifting from an investmentdriven economy to one based on consumption an early target of the investigations were milk formula producers such as mead johnson , danone and abbott laboratories , following a scandal over domestic chinese brands found to be tainted with melamine that led to infant deaths next up for scrutiny was starbucks and pharmaceuticals , and now technology and auto companies among those monitoring the parade of investigators and the terse news reports from the statecontrolled news media is david hoffman , vice president and managing director of the conference board china center for economics and business following are excerpts from an interview what s going on \? are foreign companies behaving unfairly \? it s funny that no one is looking at this from the perspective of what would actually constitute a monopoly situation if you look at the case of the milk powder companies a year ago , there are several dozen players in china , none with share so significant as to have market power i think 10 of them were accused of monopoly pricing behavior , and six eventually got fined there arguably aren t monopoly pricing conditions , de facto , if you re talking about 10 competitors so how are we to understand these allegations \? sticking to observable realities and the facts , my main remark would be do any of the accused actually enjoy monopolylevel marketshare positions to the extent they would have the pricing power to overcharge to generate supranormal profits \? this certainly doesn t appear to be the case the accused , in fact , have relatively minor shares in quite fragmented markets consumers thus have ample alternatives , it seems to me , to vote with their patronage if they are unhappy about pricing i said the same about the alleged grievances regarding starbucks s pricing a year ago there were and are still lots and lots of places chinese consumers can buy coffee if they feel overcharged by starbucks china was a closed economy for a long time and is still an economy dominated by stateowned industry are foreign multinationals really that powerful in china \? based on the financial disclosures of foreign brands that break out china performance , most are experiencing significant margin compression in china as growth slows and costs rise , etc supranormal profitability in china is not a luxury enjoyed by any multinational company i ve ever spoken with , ever based on this logic , it seems to me the motivations for these antimonopoly accusations must be for something other than antimonopoly concerns what might those motivations be \? it stands to reason that the allegations may in part be related to protecting championed local brands by discrediting their foreign competitors but conceptually , and ironically , forcing popular foreign brands to lower prices should ultimately result in the foreign brands accruing even more market share vis vis local competitors , and deeper penetration in the chinese market anything else \? it would be a very , very serious concern for foreign investors in china if this proves to be an effort , under the guise of antimonopoly concerns , to deliberately curtail the profitability and success of foreign brands in china just because they are resented , as a matter of principle or worse , ideology by some in government
the grandparents stood for franklin d roosevelt s new deal and its massive expansion of government power the children marched for civil rights and a war s end , demanding changes in law and policy and now the grandchildren use uber to ferry their children to  that is the picture painted by new polling data on american political loyalties it depicts , among other things , a rising generation of leftleaning americans who possess less faith than their elders in the power of government to combat injustices and pursue noble collective enterprises , and who seem to place greater stock in rugged , selfstarting individualism perhaps the most staggering finding , in was this the socalled next generation left is seven times more likely than traditional liberals 68 percent to 10 percent to agree with the statement that blacks who ca n't get ahead are responsible for their own condition coupled with in the same poll showing a coming generation of rightleaners who are laissezfaire both on social issues like and in their view of economic redistribution , there appears to be untapped opportunity for candidates aligned with these libertariantending youth none of this is good news if you believe in the redeeming power of government and yet the collapse of liberal faith in the state makes sense if you think of the realities with which the socalled millennial generation those born in the 1980s and 1990s have grown up the antistate views found on the right are anchored in rural life it s an antigovernment impulse born of skepticism of a state that often feels remote and , when it comes around to collect your taxes or regulate your guns , invasive in contrast , the antistate feelings for the nextgeneration left simmer among educated urbanites in their case , it seems to be more a matter of being seduced by the idea of competition and the market in this age of globalization , personal brands and thinly regulated , selforganized bedandbreakfast , carservice and crowdfunding platforms their parents may tell stories about union membership or freedom rides to register africanamerican voters in the south but the educated young now come of age in an era dominated by businessspeak and business thinking they massage personal brands as though they were the marketing department of cocacola they wear movementmeasuring wristbands and track and improve their performance they are entrepreneurs , with what a friend of mine calls side hustles selling things on etsy and renting out spare rooms on airbnb though some may fight it , they cannot , in the main , escape amazon and its cutthroat brand of capitalism the stuff is so cheap ! and arrives so fast ! they have come up during a wave of intensive globalization , and many have resigned themselves to its logic of everything being made in the cheapest place , with the cheapest workers , for the cheapest price when they fight against that logic , it tends to be personal , not political the locally foraged mushrooms on menus in brooklyn and the mission district in san francisco are a smallscale elite secession from the ways of ruthless global trade , not a political resistance of it saru jayaraman , a labor activist for restaurant workers , has written of urbane consumers in nice restaurants who are more worried about the lives of the animals they eat than of the workers who serve up the animals sustainability , she has written , is about contributing to a society that everybody benefits from , not just going organic because you do n't want to die from cancer or have a difficult pregnancy but this is a generation of american young people who may be rightly suspicious of grand collective enterprises they have watched a pair of flawed wars , a botched campaign against drugs , a failure to stem the worst financial crisis in decades , the end of the program , endless washington gridlock , the eclipse of stateprovided technologies like home phone service and mail by privately provided ones like smartphones and email and , being young and having short memories , they take for granted all the unsung miraculous ways that government does work where it once did n't
washington prodemocracy advocates in hong kong are girding for what some predict will be a tense final showdown with the chinese government over whether beijing will permit genuine democracy to take root in the former british colony but in washington , where the political quarrels in a wealthy asian financial center understandably capture less attention than marauding militants in iraq or russian artillery units in ukraine , there has been little reaction to the clash in hong kong over a new voting law that should change this weekend , when susan e rice , president obama s national security adviser , is scheduled to make her first visit to beijing since taking the job 15 months ago administration officials say ms rice will raise american concerns about the standoff in hong kong when she meets with chinese leaders it will be just one topic on a crowded agenda that includes nuclear talks with iran , tensions after a chinese fighter jet buzzed an american surveillance plane last month , and president vladimir v putin s incursions into ukraine , which american officials worry are being watched with a bit too much admiration by president xi jinping it s a relationship that has been somewhat frazzled and rocky over the last six months , said jeffrey a bader , a former senior adviser on china in the national security council therefore , having white house involvement in the relationship helps steady it for ms rice , who prides herself on her blunt advocacy of human rights , the throngs of protesters in hong kong are difficult to ignore while she does not want the topic to swamp her visit , a senior official said she would remind the chinese that hong kong had thrived with westernstyle civil liberties since britain returned it to china in 1997 a new law proposed by china s legislature would require candidates for chief executive of hong kong to be vetted by a committee , effectively ruling out anyone the chinese government deemed unacceptable prodemocracy activists are promising a new era of civil disobedience , with demonstrators threatening to paralyze the financial district of a city that is home to more than 50 , 000 american expatriates china s likely response will be to tell ms rice not to meddle in its internal affairs few people expect the chinese government to retreat from its proposal , which has put hong kong s prodemocracy parties in a bind because if they reject it , they are rejecting a law that , on paper , gives every citizen the right to vote for hong kong s leader still , prodemocracy leaders fervently hope ms rice will register american concern , particularly since hong kong s old colonial sovereign , britain , which negotiated guarantees of civil liberties and autonomy with the chinese for hong kong , has said next to nothing about it great britain has already capitulated , so the chinese have dismissed them , said anson chan , a former top official in the hong kong government who has become a democratic activist but they do care they especially care about what the united states says a longtime democratic leader , martin lee , said the united states had a stake in the dispute that went beyond its usual commitment to democratic values at the behest of china and britain , it endorsed the 1984 joint declaration that guaranteed hong kong a high degree of autonomy and its own political system for 50 years after the handover china cannot tell the us , none of your business , ' because they lobbied for us support for it , mr lee said , adding that china might feel emboldened to breach international agreements in march , mr lee and mrs chan visited washington to drum up american support for hong kong s beleaguered democrats they met with the house minority leader , representative nancy pelosi of california , and with senator mark s kirk , republican of illinois , and they got a dropin meeting with vice president joseph r biden jr that infuriated chinese officials , some of whom suggested that the united states was fomenting unrest for the first time since 2007 , congress has reinstated an annual reporting requirement in the 1992 hong kong policy act , which mandates that the state department assess the city s progress still , the melancholy reality for hong kong is that the white house , like 10 downing street , has other fish to fry with the chinese to date , the only official american response to the voting law is a statement from the state department that the united states supports universal suffrage in hong kong , but refrains from criticizing the chinese government administration officials declined to speak on the record about hong kong before ms rice s visit a spokesman for the national security adviser , patrick ventrell , said , the administration remains committed to our rebalance to asia , and that includes close and continuing consultation with top chinese leadership directly from the white house in sending ms rice , the white house is seeking to revive a channel that was used by her predecessor , tom donilon , who met several times with dai bingguo , then china s top foreignpolicy official mr dai has been replaced by yang jiechi , a former foreign minister who is viewed as having less influence with the top leaders than mr dai just getting to china has been tricky for ms rice , given the cascade of crises in the middle east and ukraine but with mr obama scheduled to visit beijing in november , officials said it was important for her to go to plan that visit she will fly directly from the nato summit meeting in wales with ukraine on her mind , she is likely to emphasize the west s determination to counter russia s actions tensions between the united states and china spiked last month after a chinese fighter came within 30 feet of a navy surveillance plane with issues like that on the table , the twilight struggle of hong kong s democrats may be the least of ms rice s worries
athens i have been coming to two or three times a year for more than 40 years and served as the times s correspondent in athens from 1977 to 1980 over those decades i watched succeeding greek governments get into a vicious cycle that sent the national debt soaring higher than mount olympus and threatened to unravel the entire european union every time elections approached , the party in power would add thousands of new hires to public payrolls , raise salaries and pensions , and increase benefits when some ministers would try to cut back even a little after elections , hordes of angry demonstrators would besiege the parliament or block highways and ports until the politicians caved in and withdrew or watered down their meager reforms but over the past two years greece seems to have undergone a profound sea change the coalition government led by prime minister of the new democracy party has passed some of the most severe austerity measures in the country s postwar history , slashing public spending , cutting wages and pensions almost in half , imposing bruising taxes , and reducing the purchasing power of greeks by more than 30 percent surprisingly , all these afflictions have been accepted with considerable equanimity there have been demonstrations , to be sure , including a national strike this thursday , but they have been feeble and fleeting greek voters seized the opportunity to show their anger in last may s election for the european parliament when they gave the most votes to the radical left party syriza and the neonazi party golden dawn came in third , but that did not move the government to soften its policies what has brought about such forbearance in a people thucydides described as born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others \? one reason is the grudging recognition that if the government did not accept the harsh terms imposed by the country s main lenders the international monetary fund , the european commission and the european central bank there would be no funds to pay them any salaries or pensions at all a second , and perhaps key , reason is that the strict economic policies of the government have begun to bear fruit and better days now seem possible greece recorded a primary budget surplus of 228 million euros for the first half of 2014 , compared with 25 million euros at the same time in 2013 unemployment has started to inch lower , to 259 percent in august from an allyear high of 28 percent , recorded in november 2013 , though it remains the highest in europe greece has experienced a tourist boom , attracting 179 million international visitors last year , and income from it has fueled the economy and the country s credit rating has improved steadily last august , moody s raised it two notches , to caa1 from caa3 , citing the government s progress in fiscal consolidation , and later standard and poor s raised its rating from b to b most important , the economy grew by 17 percent in the third quarter , in comparison with the third quarter of 2013 , the first growth in six years which prompted mr samaras to declare this was the fastest growth in the quarter in the whole eurozone greece is back ! do the resolve of the greek government and the stoicism of the greek people show that a new political maturity has descended upon the country \? for now it seems so , but the abyss is looming into view once again as the country moves inexorably toward another crisis next february , when the parliament must assemble a 60 percent majority to elect a new president for the country the ruling conservativesocialist coalition has only 155 votes , and if it fails to muster another 25 from smaller parties and independents then new national elections will have to be held and there s the rub current polls , reflecting popular frustration with the government s austerity measures , show syriza , the main opposition party , ahead by 36 points over new democracy but mr samaras , a 63yearold veteran politician and harvard mba , is still rated best choice for prime minister over the syriza leader , alexis tsipras , a 40yearold civil engineer and admirer of che , mao and hugo ch vez what all this means is that no party is likely to win enough votes to form a new government and that a prolonged struggle would ensue to patch together another coalition the last time that happened , in 2012 , it triggered an outflow of more than 23 billion in deposits greek banks were unable to respond to the withdrawals , and planeloads of euros were flown in from the european central bank to avoid a bank run with the prospect that the next elections might be won by syriza , financial experts believe that a run three to four times greater than 2012 is likely while the 23 billion shortfall in that year was covered by the ecb , today a much weaker eurozone would hardly be in a position to transfer over 100 billion to greece if another huge run were to occur in this scenario , the vacuum of currency would bring greece to technical bankruptcy the hardwon gains of the past two years would vanish access to loans would disappear the faltering economy would come to a standstill , and the only recourse for greece would be to return to the drachma , a disastrous move for a country that imports much of the goods it consumes so a lot more is riding on the selection of a president next february than who will be the new head of state if the members of parliament make a choice and avoid premature elections , a new sense of responsibility in the country may have a chance to take root and lead the greek people to a promising future if they do n't , the recent hardships greeks have faced will pale in comparison with the troubles ahead

the is best known for what it lacks a conductor but over the course of the past 40plus years , it has also distinguished itself with its bold commitment to new music expressed through a commissioning program that tirelessly seeks out fresh compositional voices and novel ways to integrate them into the classical repertory on saturday at , the ensemble , joined by the impressive violinist , presented the new york premiere of a deeply expressive new work by the britishborn composer that was thoughtfully woven into a program of works by grieg , bach and mozart the threemovement piece , rest these hands , is an arrangement of parts of a larger work , the violin , which was born out of a combination of serendipity and loss in 2008 , in the wake of her mother s death , ms clyne purchased a 200yearold violin for small change in a thrift shop in oxford over the course of the next few years , with the lovingly restored instrument offering inspiration , she composed a succession of short pieces for violin solo and in combination with other voices that became both a graceful memorial to her mother and an expression of grief the consoling shadow of bach looms large in the first movement , reflected in a series of unaccompanied agitated arpeggios and searching scales , which ms koh played with robust refinement but there are also very contemporary , keening slides that glide through the microtones in between the notes of the regular scale , as if searching for signs of life between the cracks of the physical world in the second movement , the orchestra offers support in the shape of undulating lines that sometimes overlap in subtly destabilizing ways the final section is a soaring elegy with the soloist circling high above the ensemble as it ascends and , gingerly , descends in measured scales , ending on one last sliding sigh in bach s violin concerto in a minor , ms koh s tone was more slender and pliable , nestled into the orchestral fabric in the sorrowful slow movement , her expression felt somewhat contained , as if respect for bach s notes stalled any investigation of the emotions they stood for the fast outer movements were brisk , crisp and confident with grieg s holberg suite \( op 40 \) , the program offered another homage to the past the suite of dance movements \( and one air \) for strings has some of the neoclassical playfulness of britten and stravinsky , but none of their ironic bite instead , the neobaroque score is leavened with comely folk influences , which the orpheus players rendered with an exquisite balance between rhythmic discipline and intuitivesounding elasticity of phrasing but most appealing was the sound of the strings , warm and richly blended , with the character of individual voices showing through , as the natural grain shows through in polished wood for mozart s symphony no 34 , woodwind , brass and timpani joined in for a jubilant and sparkling performance after the inward and backwardlooking music that preceded it , the symphony s boisterous optimism and confidence felt like a release
it is difficult to read stories about elliot rodger , the 22yearold man who went on a murderous spree in isla vista , calif , last month , without feeling some empathy for his parents we know that his mother , alarmed by some of his misogynistic , made a call that resulted in the headline from that meeting was that rodger , seemingly calm and collected , easily deflected the police s attention but there was surely a subtext how worried how desperate , really must a mother be to believe the police should be called on her own son \? we also learned that on the day of his murderous rampage , his mother , having read the first few lines of his manifesto , had phoned his father , from whom she was divorced in separate cars , from los angeles to santa barbara hoping to stop what they feared was about to happen and then , on monday , , we learned the rest of it how rodger was clearly a troubled soul before he even turned 8 years old how his parents' concern about his mental health was like a shadow that hung over this los angeles family nearly every day of elliot s life constantly bullied and unable to fit in , he went through three high schools in college , he tried to throw a girl off a ledge at a party and was beaten up \( i'm going to kill them , he said to a neighbor afterward \) he finally retreated to some internet sites that drew sexually frustrated young men , according to the times throughout , said one person who knew rodger , his mom did everything she could to help elliot but what his parents never did was the one thing that might have prevented him from buying a gun have him committed to a psychiatric facility california s tough gun laws notwithstanding , a background check only if he had had inpatient mental health treatment , made a serious threat to an identifiable victim in the presence of a therapist , or had a criminal record he had none of the above should his parents have taken more steps to have him treated \? could they have \? it is awfully hard to say , even in retrospect on the one hand , there were plainly people who knew him who feared that he might someday harm others on the other hand , those people were n't psychiatrists he was a loner , a misfit , whose parents were more fearful of how the world would treat their son than how their son would treat the world and his mother , after all , did reach out for help , and the police responded and decided they had no cause to arrest him , where his guns were hidden once again , a mass killing has triggered calls for doing something to keep guns away from the mentally ill and , once again , the realities of the situation convey how difficult a task that is there are , after all , plenty of young , male , alienated loners the nowstandard description of mass shooters but very few of them become killers and you ca n't go around committing them all because a tiny handful might turn out to be killers indeed , the law is very clear on this point in 1975 , that nondangerous mentally ill people ca n't be confined against their will if they can function without confinement in california , the bar is very high for people like elliot , said dr e fuller torrey , who founded the treatment advocacy center in a sense , california s commitment to freedom for the mentally ill conflicts with its backgroundcheck law torrey believes that the country should involuntarily commit more mentally ill people , not only because they can sometimes commit acts of violence but because there are far more people who ca n't function in the world than the mental health community likes to acknowledge in this , however , he is an outlier the mainstream sentiment among mental health professionals is that there is no going back to the badold days when people who were capable of living on their own were locked up for years in mental hospitals the truth is , the kind of symptoms elliot rodger showed were unlikely to get him confined in any case and without a history of confinement , he had every legal right to buy a gun you read the stories about elliot rodger and it is easy to think if this guy , with all his obvious problems , can slip through the cracks , then what hope is there of ever stopping mass shootings \? but , of course , there is another way of thinking about this instead of focusing on making it harder for the mentally ill to get guns , maybe we should be making it harder to get guns , period something to consider before the next mass shooting
seoul , south korea the north korean military on tuesday fired dozens of artillery shells near a disputed western sea border with south korea , prompting thousands of south korean islanders to flee to shelters earlier tuesday , north korea told the south that it had designated two firing zones near the northern limit line , which south korea defends as a western sea demarcation line north korea claims a border line farther south north korea subsequently fired about 50 rounds of artillery , but none were believed to have fallen south of the disputed maritime border the waters around the disputed sea border remain the most volatile section of the interkorean frontier and have been the scene of several naval skirmishes between the two countries in recent years south korea s military increased its vigilance on tuesday north korea conducted similar drills in the region on march 31 , firing more than 500 rounds of artillery and rockets at the time , more than a hundred rounds landed south of the disputed border south korean marines on a frontier island fired back , lobbing 300 rounds of artillery north of the line north korea s livefire drills followed its harsh criticism of a summit meeting between president obama and his south korean counterpart , park geunhye , in seoul on friday after their meeting , the two leaders pledged to impose more sanctions if the north conducted another nuclear test they also promised to pressure the north korean government over its human rights abuses on sunday , the north lashed out , calling ms park a dirty prostitute in thrall to the pimp mr obama south korean officials and american think tanks have reported increased activities at an underground nuclear test site in punggyeri in northeastern north korea , raising fears of a possible nuclear detonation
danny vinik notes that reform conservatives , who are trying either to rescue the right from its intellectual torpor or to provide cover for its fundamental antiintellectualism your choice have gotten a fair bit of lip service for some of their ideas , but none at all for one key proposal activist monetary policy to assure full employment this was predictable the neomonetarist movement starts from an acknowledgement of reality shortfalls of aggregate demand do happen , and they do matter , and we need an answer like the original monetarists , however , they reject any government role in the form of discretionary fiscal policy instead , they argue that the fed and its counterparts can do the job all on their own if they really want to i don t buy this on the economics to do what s needed central banks either have to take on a lot of risk , which is in effect a form of fiscal policy , or change inflation expectations , which is far beyond conventional monetary policy but we don t need to hash this out here the more important point is that the neomonetarists are deluded in imagining that there is any constituency for their ideas in the modern conservative movement remember what happened when the fed began a partial move toward the kind of policy they want practically the whole republican establishment began screaming at ben bernanke that he was debasing the currency and surely you don t think that the failure of inflation to materialize has changed their minds and underlying this total opposition to monetary expansion lie two deep forces first , much of the right is thoroughly committed to the view that bad things only happen because of the government , that the private sector will never have problems if it has low taxes and the security of the gold standard paul ryan is effectively the intellectual leader of the gop and he gets his monetary economics from characters in ayn rand novels  moreover , the kalecki argument about why business interests oppose activist fiscal policy applies to monetary policy too if captains of industry want the body politic to believe that prosperity depends on their confidence so that any criticism leads to depression they re going to hate monetarism as much as they hate keynesianism , because both imply that full employment depends on policy , not their hurt feelings so there s really no constituency for neomonetarism milton friedman would be an isolated outcast in today s conservative movement , and his wouldbe successors have no home
washington when john f kennedy came to the university of michigan to campaign for president in the fall of 1960 , africa was plagued with trade and governance challenges far more daunting than those it faces today the young senator recognized that african nations like other countries emerging from colonialism were preoccupied with developing basic literacy and manpower and so he urged students to go abroad and help them the spirited response resulted in one of america s greatest gifts to the world the peace corps next week , president obama is convening a usafrica leaders summit in washington the stated objective is investing in the next generation but the summit s focus on private sector deals wo n't necessarily further that goal there is a way to make a lasting and lowcost investment in africa s next generation mr obama must bring education and science and technology in particular to the forefront of the debate about african development africa is experiencing an economic upswing , but its growth is predominantly based on extracting natural resources rather than increasing industrial productivity african economies are still dominated by lowlevel processing of natural resources and the production of simple consumer goods for local consumption most of these nations are far from making any internationally significant technological breakthroughs what ultimately distinguishes and continues to handicap africa is its lack of mastery of modern science and technology without advanced competency in these areas , nations cannot harness the full power of scientific research and technological tools to solve the many health , energy and development challenges confronting them scientific and technological advancement will help eradicate poverty and promote homegrown economic development by providing africa with the tools to address its own challenges and expand its industrial productivity and promoting such advancement is a much more lasting investment that offers surer and higher returns than continuously funneling aid dollars for shortterm fixes a growing number of african leaders and organizations have realized the value of science , technology , engineering and mathematics \( stem \) education in developing industrial capacity and a trained workforce in fields like health and energy corporatefunded research centers in africa already exist , but achieving major breakthroughs will require international partnerships between government , business and academia at home , the obama administration has consistently made stem education a core policy and budgetary priority america should now embrace a scienceled agenda in africa by partnering american institutions of higher education , scientific research centers and technological entrepreneurs with african countries to help them bolster economic growth and reduce dependency on foreign aid greater cooperation in these areas will increase trade and drive the expansion of african market opportunities for the united states science and technology cooperation has long been part of america s policy toward china , india , pakistan and israel since 1959 , beneficiaries of americanisraeli scientific cooperation have won 43 the united states currently has over 50 scientific agreements and partnerships with foreign governments , but none with any african country this must change next week s summit and future american policy toward africa must address the scientific and technological capabilities needed to transform african economies , establish new forms of exchange and cooperation and reallocate resources to finance this the money is already there there are a variety of ongoing programs that could serve as a foundation the united states agency for international development s higher education project , the national academies' african science academy development initiative project , the president s emergency plan for aids relief and power africa pepfar and power africa , for example , both seek to solve problems the aids crisis and energy shortages that require advanced scientific and technological competency however , these programs are currently implemented through development aid instruments because they are donorinitiated projects , they do n't reflect african nations' own shifting priorities toward improving their indigenous science and technology capabilities instead of continuing to focus on delivery of developed products like manufactured drugs and solarenergy panels to passive consumers , a reallocation of a small percentage of the more than 30 billion in government funds slated for these two programs between 2014 and 2018 could establish a new 1 billion regional fund for joint research activities that would strengthen existing institutions and help establish new ones to train the next generation of africans in science and engineering disciplines so that they can take ownership of solving their own problems america should also initiate a program to recruit and train 100 , 000 african graduate students in stem fields at american institutions over the next 10 years while making it easier for american scientists to teach and conduct research in africa american scientists would become better educated about africa s development challenges and the influx of visitors doing cuttingedge research would improve the standard of african teaching and research fiftyfour years after jfk asked michigan students how many of you who are going to be doctors are willing to spend your days in ghana \? another young and inspiring american president must ask the same of america s higher education establishment and scientific community so that african nations can continue on the road to fulfilling their true potential
the books i have written have each been dedicated to the same two people my wife and my psychotherapist my psychotherapist preceded my wife he also preceded my writing i found him one summer afternoon by a stroke of luck , when , 27 years old and in the midst of a crisis , i called my health insurance company asking for a referral my only criterion was proximity , which in retrospect seems impossibly na ve i picked at random from half a dozen names , and a few days later i walked into a strange man s 11thfloor office , where i sat down in front of a window that had a view of the new york skyline i remember that it was evening , and that the therapist , who was in his early 30s and wearing a tie , seemed nice enough but after we said hello and settled in , he said nothing at all , just nodded as if to indicate that i should begin but begin where \? it wasn t cold in his office but i was shaking my first experience with therapy or more precisely , with the idea of therapy had come a decade earlier , in my senior year of high school , when my mother , overwrought by the news that her therapist was ending her practice and moving away for good , attempted to kill herself by overdosing on antidepressants my mother , plagued by an occasionally crippling , always present depression throughout most of her life \( and all of my childhood \) , had a few years earlier summoned the wherewithal to seek professional help and while i was not privy to the specific diagnosis of clinical depression , i was privy to her rage , her paranoia , her fatigue and her sorrow , all of which she experienced in the extreme , and all of which i thought , of course , were entirely normal in the same way that i thought it was normal to come from a broken family and to reside in a cramped and cluttered onebedroom apartment where the rule of thumb was pessimism and the smallest tasks were regarded as monumentally burdensome making dinner was exhausting and often sad , and so was doing the laundry , and so was as my mother pointed out to me one afternoon on the way home from nursery school the blade of grass struggling out of a crack in the sidewalk while i had some vague awareness in my teenage years that my mother was seeing someone about something , beyond that i had no real understanding , and no real interest all of that changed one october morning as i left for school , i noticed that my mother was lying face down on her bed in the living room she had been in the same position the night before when i d gotten home from my job bagging groceries at the supermarket , and i d assumed that she had simply gone to bed early , just as i assumed now that she was not feeling well and was taking the day off but an hour or so later , at school , i was ushered out of the classroom by a principal s aide and into an empty office where a phone call from my mother s work informed me that she had not called in sick that day or the day before i left for home immediately , overwhelmed and petrified , walking through the city streets with the understanding that i was about to discover that my mother , unbeknown to me , had died two days ago in our apartment and sure enough , when i opened the front door , there she was in the same position , face down in bed it took me great effort to rouse her lifeless , unyielding body , and when she finally woke up she was groggy , incoherent and irritated i pleaded with her to tell me what was wrong , but her reply was merely , you wouldn t understand i suppose there was some truth to that what i wasn t able to understand , at the age of 16 , was that the relationship she had developed with her therapist had become the most emotionally intimate of her life and subsequently , the news of this woman s impending departure had devastated my mother to the point where she no longer wanted to go on living this was all perplexing to me , but mostly it was shameful i ended up taking my mother to the hospital by cab , and she reiterated to the doctors her desire to die , but somehow promised that she wouldn t how they believed her , i don t know later that evening , i did what most people do after a distressing event , which is to try to regain some sense of normalcy , and so i showed up on time for my shift at the supermarket a friend , no doubt noticing that my eyes were red from crying , asked me what was wrong , but i refused to say in return , he offered the platitude , life isn t a bowl of cherries , and for some reason this provided a sense of comfort but ultimately i felt as if i was doomed to keep secret what had transpired and true to form , my mother and i never really addressed the events of that day the remaining few years we lived together were spent the way all the other years had been spent between us , not talking about the essential things in our home so a decade later , at the age of 27 , when for reasons that now seem remarkably obvious , i began to notice that i was having difficulty maintaining meaningful relationships with women , i sought out a therapist i had just broken up with one girlfriend , whom in the beginning i loved madly , and in the end disdained , only to replace her with another girlfriend i also started off loving madly i had an inkling that these relationships were following a pattern , and that if i ever hoped to have something lasting like a marriage i needed to make some significant changes it was the first girlfriend who suggested i seek professional help , a suggestion that did not go over well , considering that my experience of professional help had been negligible improvement , utter dependency and wholesale despair this was the unfortunate legacy of my mother s experience the antidote turns toxic the argument that i honed and offered freely was that therapy was the domain of those too weak to understand their own brains ie , the mentally unstable or feebleminded or upper middle class none of which i wanted to be associated with but when my second girlfriend affirmed my first girlfriend s appraisal , i knew that there was something deeper at work inside of me , something that i couldn t solve on my own , and that it would be a fatal mistake to continue laying the blame for every breakup on the fact that the woman was no longer pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough the first thing i said to my therapist in that initial visit was that i was there because i was having trouble staying in a relationship i offered up a compendium of traumatic events from my childhood that i thought might have some bearing on the matter , of which my mother s suicide attempt was only one i don t recall exactly what we talked about in the beginning , but i came away with a sense that the therapist was a sympathetic and understanding man , and also quite funny he had a shrewd ability to break tension by offering a wellplaced joke for instance , when i recounted the confusing night , when i was 4 or 5 , that my mother brought a strange man into our apartment , my therapist offered , perhaps he came over for tea and a scone but mostly there was heaviness in those early months of therapy my appointment happened to follow that of a blind woman , who would come out tapping her cane , an intense metaphor , which like all metaphors in my life i could not process and when i would leave his office , 45 minutes later , it would be dark out , and i would have a crushing feeling of hopelessness , which i knew could be remedied by only one thing seeing my therapist again the first time he went on vacation , he asked me how i felt about being left by him , but i could not draw any sort of parallel between the past and the present , and i told him i had no opinion whatsoever what are we going to do with all this \? i asked him one evening , just as our session was ending by which i meant , how will it ever be possible to alleviate these unhappy memories that can never be undone \?

cairo secretary of state received broad assurances but no public commitments from on saturday as he continued his tour of the middle east to try to assemble a coalition behind an american campaign against the extremist group known as the  in baghdad , meanwhile , the new prime minister took a small step toward alleviating the deep alienation that has made some in the sunni muslim minority receptive to isis he said saturday that he had ordered the iraqi security forces to stop the indiscriminate shelling of civilian communities under the control of the militants together , the professions of good intentions in baghdad and cairo underscored the long road ahead for the obama administration as it tries to assemble a regional coalition to roll back and dismantle isis after meeting with mr kerry in cairo , sameh shoukry , egypt s foreign minister , declared at a joint news conference that egypt believes it is very important for the world to continue their efforts strongly to fight this extremism but egyptian officials declined to specify what help they would provide in the campaign against isis , and mr shoukry made it clear that he also had in mind fighting islamist militants at home and in neighboring libya mr kerry has already visited baghdad amman , jordan and ankara , turkey and he attended an emergency meeting of regional governments in jidda , saudi arabia , in which arab nations endorsed a coordinated military and political campaign against isis saudi arabia has pledged to allow the training of syrian rebel forces opposed to isis at bases in its territory , but no country in the region has publicly detailed what military support it might provide early sunday , prime minister tony abbott of australia committed aircraft and military advisers to the effort he said in a statement that the commitment was a response to a formal request from the united states , adding that combat troops would not be deployed the isil death cult threatens the people of , the region and the wider world , mr abbott said , referring to the group by the acronym for an alternate name , the islamic state in iraq and the levant the obama administration is keen to enlist material support from regional powers with sunni muslim majorities like egypt , turkey and saudi arabia to avoid the impression that the united states is intervening in a sectarian war on behalf of the shiitedominated iraqi government against its opponents in the sunni minority , some of whom have lent support to isis egypt is not expected to make an important military contribution rather , american officials want cairo to use its clout as the traditional capital of sunni islam and home to the al azhar center of sunni scholarship to mobilize public opinion in the arab world against isis as an intellectual and cultural capital of the muslim world , egypt has a critical role to play , mr kerry said after isis made headlines around the world for beheading american hostages , militants in sinai began carrying out beheadings as well , and egyptian state media seized on the atrocities to underscore that the government s fight to consolidate its authority at home was part of the same fight as the american battle with isis a senior state department official traveling with mr kerry said that there were anecdotal accounts that volunteers who had fought with isis in iraq and syria had later provided tactical advice to the main egyptian militant group , ansar bayt almaqdis , while stopping in the sinai peninsula on their way back to their homes in egypt and north africa they stop off and sort of lend their professional skills , said the state department official , who could not be identified under the agency s rules for briefing reporters these terrorist groups are beginning to cooperate while in cairo , mr kerry met with president abdel fattah elsisi of egypt , mr shoukry and nabil alaraby , the secretary general of the arab league during a visit in july , mr kerry sought to strengthen relations with mr sisi by declaring that he was confident that the united states would soon restore military aid it had suspended after egypt s military ousted president mohamed morsi of the muslim brotherhood and waged a bloody crackdown on his islamist supporters but mr kerry also pressed mr sisi on certain human rights issues , including the case of three journalists for al jazeera s englishlanguage network who were charged with conspiring with the muslim brotherhood to broadcast false reports of chaos in remarks after their meeting , mr kerry said he had received a very positive response from mr sisi the next day , an egyptian judge overlooked an absence of evidence , convicted the journalists and sentenced each one to at least seven years in prison none of the journalists a canadian citizen , an australian and an egyptian have any history of brotherhood ties or political activism mr kerry insisted on saturday that he had not refrained from pressing human rights concerns even as he sought egypt s cooperation in fighting isis the united states does not ever trade its concerns over human rights for any other objective , mr kerry said we had a frank discussion today , he said , adding that he understood the independence of the egyptian judiciary he said he was confident the issues would be addressed on an appropriate schedule that is controlled by egyptians , not by me or anybody else complaining in baghdad , haider alabadi , the new iraqi prime minister , was speaking in a televised news conference about the plight of displaced iraqis when he declared that he had told the security forces to stop the indiscriminate shelling of civilian populations in sunni towns under the control of isis i have issued the orders to stop the indiscriminate shelling on cities inhabited by civilians , mr abadi said , including cities where isis terrorists are operating senior iraqi officials have acknowledged in recent days that shelling by their armed forces has killed innocent civilians in the course of the battle against isis , but mr abadi s statement appeared to go further by indicating that an order from the armed forces could curtail the indiscriminate shelling , he implied that the shelling had previously been tolerated as a matter of government policy such broadbrush attacks on sunni towns have been part of what many sunnis called a pattern of sectarian bias by the shiitedominated security forces in a report set to be issued sunday , the independent group human rights watch said that one iraqi government at the beginning of this month hit a school near tikrit where displaced sunni families had taken refuge it killed at least 31 civilians , including 24 children , the group said , calling for an investigation human rights watch reported in july that 17 iraqi government airstrikes , including six with barrel bombs , had killed at least 75 civilians and wounded hundreds more in several mainly sunni areas the united nations special representative for iraq , nickolay mladenov , said in a statement that he welcomed and commended mr abadi s order
nantucket , mass the hole at the cemetery was dug the flowers had arrived , family and friends had gathered , food was ready for the reception all that was missing was the deceased doris davis could not make her own funeral ms davis , 92 , was born here , died here and wanted to be buried here but the island s only funeral home had closed in january since then , the bodies of the dead have had to be shipped by ferry , a twoandahalf hour ride across nantucket sound , to be embalmed at a funeral home on the cape cod mainland and then brought back by ferry for burial but on feb 14 , the day of ms davis s funeral , new england was digging out from a huge snowstorm and bracing for the next foul weather forced the cancellation of the ferry that was to bring ms davis home her body spent almost a month on the mainland at the funeral home , but suspended in what her daughter called a heartbreaking limbo the episode appalled and saddened people on the island , and inspired some to redouble their efforts to establish a nonprofit funeral service here but they are being opposed by powerful organizations representing massachusetts' cemeteries and funeral directors those groups say nantucket s efforts could open the door for other towns to set up their own funeral homes , which , they say , would undermine state regulations and even threaten public health local officials say those arguments are specious and that the organizations are simply worried about losing business either way , nantucket s loss points up the perils of living on an island , even one as seemingly wealthy as this that wealth is evident in the summer , when weathered mansions that are closed in the offseason spring to life and the population quadruples but it is the permanent residents who tend to die here , and increasingly , they are immigrants , who now make up a quarter of the yearround population many cannot afford a funeral , especially at offisland prices the closing of the home here also gives a glimpse into the nation s 20billionayear funeral industry that industry is in flux , due in part to a sharp increase in cremations , which cost about a third as much as funerals and give families more control today , 44 percent of all deaths nationally result in cremation , says the cremation association of north america , compared with 33 percent in 1996 in addition , large corporations are buying up familyowned funeral homes , closing some and raising prices in the last decade , says the national directory of morticians red book , 10 percent of the nation s funeral homes have closed in january , richard lewis , 79 , closed the grayshingled funeral home here that his family had owned since 1878 none of his relatives were in a position to carry on the business and it was losing money , not only because of more cremations but because many immigrant families , averse to cremation , could not afford burials mr lewis often absorbed those costs , local officials said , and over the past decade lost 200 , 000 doing indigent burials the lewis family did not want to leave the island without someone to care for its dead but funeral directors on the mainland were not interested in taking over nantucket s relatively low volume of business of 52 deaths last year , only 20 funerals were conducted , with the remaining bodies being cremated could not justify the cost of real estate we considered buying it , but it did n't make sense financially , said bill chapman , coowner of the johnlawrence funeral home in marstons mills , on cape cod with no one to continue the business , the lewis family sold the home to a developer for 125 million since then , the johnlawrence funeral home has been providing funeral services on the island from the mainland , which mr chapman said added about 1 , 000 to the cost of burials it can be challenging dealing with the boat schedule it s not just a few hours , it s a full day , mr chapman said while people here say johnlawrence has handled things well , they still want their own funeral home the derailing of ms davis s funeral by bad weather highlighted the problem her daughter catherine wiandsannett , 71 , tried rescheduling the service for the next day , but ferocious seas again kept the ferries in port along with all the heartbreak and frustration and anxiety , it was very complicated and convoluted , ms wiandsannett said the service was postponed for three weeks , but several people , including her adult children , who live out west , were unable to come back that galvanized catherine flanagan stover , the longtime town clerk who is also a funeral director knowing that mr lewis would one day retire , she had been trying for years to establish a local funeral home we need a service that will be there when you call someone who knows you , ms stover said and you should n't have to depend on the weather for immediate care her plan is to petition the town to donate land for a funeral service building and then to form a nonprofit corporation to raise money to build it a builder has pledged to construct it for 300 , 000 a bargain on nantucket , ms stover said , where a starter castle costs 500 , 000 in april , residents at the annual town meeting approved a home rule petition asking the legislature to exempt nantucket from two regulations governing funeral homes that funeral directors own at least 10 percent of the business , and that the funeral service building have a chapel it is also seeking permission for a crematory , which would save families another offisland expense we do n't want to go into the funeral business , said state representative timothy madden , who represents nantucket and sponsored the measure with state senator daniel wolf but the private sector did n't step up to the plate but at a hearing before the state legislature last month , the massachusetts funeral directors association and the massachusetts cemetery association opposed nantucket s plans the cemetery association said the exemptions would cause irregularities in the application of the laws , and more towns might want their own crematories the funeral directors said that the public health might be endangered , even though nantucket is not seeking exemptions from any healthrelated regulations david walkinshaw , a spokesman for the funeral directors , said in an interview that the association s main concern was the exemption for a funeral director from having an ownership stake in the business the point , he said , was to encourage a longterm commitment to a community without that ownership , there is nothing to stop someone from going out there and working for six months and leaving , he said ms stover said the exemption would give a new funeral director flexibility to go offisland and allow a substitute to fill in she views such regulations as an attempt to block competition since the lewis home closed , the island has had 33 cremations and three burials , compared with 20 burials last year ms stover attributed the drop to the expense and discomfort of sending a loved one offisland ms wiandsannett , who is still pained by her mother s ordeal , said the island was diminished emotionally without its own funeral home as good as the services on the mainland are , she said they ca n't do what we need done here they ca n't fill that void
david brooks i don t know about you , but i stink at book titles i sweat and struggle and i just can t think of anything even slightly mediocre for my own opuses i try to get inspired by the internet lists of the best book titles ever some of them are humorous or mordant do androids dream of electric sheep \? or are you there , vodka \? it s me , chelsea or my heart is an idiot some of them are just beautiful everything is illuminated or one hundred years of solitude or the unbearable lightness of being they are all 500 times better than anything i ve ever come up with gail collins what do you mean \? bobos in paradise was a great title but i do sympathize when i did my first history book about american women , it came down to a lastminute meeting with some editors and marketing folk i couldn t leave until we had an acceptable name which turned out to be america s women david i mention this because while my title ideas are atrocious , they are not as bad as the titles given to washington memoirs gail before you go any further , let me tell you that my favorite title for a book by a washington insider is adventures of a nobody that was louisa adams , john quincy s wife not an easy guy to be married to , i believe she also once complained about the scorpion tongues of political scandal , which i stole for a book i wrote on that subject the only problem was that some book sellers apparently stocked scorpion tongues in the natural history section i apologize you were saying about memoirs david when you re writing a washington memoir , your goal , apparently , is to make sure everybody knows your book is as joyless as possible you have to have a cover shot where you look gravely concerned and a title that suggests you are a lone and stalwart champion of weighty causes hillary clinton s title , hard choices , has all the uplift of a round chunk of lead , but for excessive gravitas i have to agree with the washington post reviewer david ignatius that leon panetta s title worthy fights sets a new standard gail well , he wasn t going to call it meaningless battles although there are a lot of folks in washington who could write that book david it s odd because panetta is the opposite of a ponderous guy he s very warm , engaging and down to earth and he was a great public servant gail hmm before you go any further , tell me what you think makes a great public servant in our current , ungreat , era david you may agree or disagree with him on issues , but he had a skill that seems entirely absent these days , the ability to actually move people to do things it starts with a psychological perceptiveness , knowing what people need it continues with a sort of practical creativity coming up with angles , proposals and situations that will bring disparate people behind a common effort it also involves the ability to arouse affections , to motivate people to take action on your behalf it s amazingly rare gail you re right and isn t it strange that people would go into politics without actually having those skills \? maybe it s because politics these days is less and less about knowing how to interact with folks and more about knowing how to use the media and raise money david what do you think of panetta s decision to publish a memoir while his administration is still in office \? bob gates did it hillary did it now he has i confess i disapprove i do think there should be an unofficial rule no memoirs until your president moves out it s important to protect internal deliberations gail i agree i d give hillary a bit of a pass , given the fact that she went into the job as the most famous woman in the world , a former presidential candidate and a very likely candidate of the future president obama knew what he was getting  but you don t sign on to work in an administration and then go out and undermine the president while he s still in office and that s what so many of them do leon panetta goes on msnbc promoting his book , and says too often in my view the president relies on the logic of the law professor rather than the passion of a leader that may be true , but it s not helping helping the administration s foreign policy , i mean obviously writing about a sitting president helps sales david it s also striking to me that it s the foreign policy advisers that are happiest to dish on obama they are the ones who were most unhappy with what they saw as the president s passivity and indecision obama named activist , toughminded people to the top foreign policy jobs , who came from a certain generation that took american interventionism for granted , but then pursued a policy inconsistent with their views gail i think he s been more of an interventionist than voters might have expected , given the way he first got into office think about the surge in afghanistan , libya , all those drones i would suggest that the reason obama is getting so beaten up by memoirists on foreign policy is because the foreign policy hasn t worked they aren t trying to correct history they re trying to separate themselves from the failure which is another reason i agree with you about the unseemliness of publishing these memoirs while your old boss is still in office david i think i m developing an upstream , downstream view of public action when the tide of history is going against you , when you are swimming upstream , then active interventionism is required it s perfectly obvious the world is going to have to get more involved in iraq and syria even after the usled bombing campaign , isis is still taking over new towns , like , apparently the border town of kobani this war is going to get bigger before it gets smaller gail i still keep dropping back and wondering if we shouldn t leave this to the region let iraq s neighbors worry about iraq , and let turkey worry about kobani i may be way off base but we re having all these arguments about whether we should have soldiers fighting on the ground , and much less about whether these interventions ever work david on the other hand , and on a happier note , i was delighted to see the supreme court take no action on those gay marriage cases here s an example of where the tide of history is clearly flowing downstream leadership in this circumstance just means getting out of the way that takes fine judgment and humility gail i noticed that senator ted cruz called the supreme court s decision to take no action judicial activism at its worst still more proof that the best definition of judicial activism is any decision i don t like david i can t help pointing out that this is exactly what the court did not do with roe v wade instead of letting events take shape , the court arrogantly stopped debate and froze the two sides into extreme polarities such a bad decision , even from a prochoice perspective i suspect you disagree gail give that man a cigar ! you re right , david i totally disagree if states had been left to their own devices over the last few decades , i doubt very much you d have seen the legislatures in , say , texas or mississippi , gradually coming around today , instead of eight clinics operating in texas , there d be none women in mississippi who now have to travel to jackson would probably have to find their way to new york or california that s not much of a problem for women with assets , but it s the end of all options for the poor abortion is exactly the kind of issue that requires the supreme court s intervention it involves a critical right it s politically toxic in many parts of the country and as a practical matter it mainly has an impact on the poor david in any case , my overall point is that it s always a mistake to trust people with dispositions that are permanent gail people who permanently have a disposition \? david what i mean is that people who are always hyperactive will be terrible in certain circumstances and people who are always cautious will be terrible in others the only people you can trust are those who let their means be governed by their circumstances gail i propose a different division those who have really bad judgment and those who have really good judgment the latter can be , well , judges the former thrive on reality television the rest of us will have to muddle along in the middle maybe there s a book in this i ll work up a proposal if you think up a title
one of my first columns for the times was a nonrequiem for arlen specter s career as a moderate republican , in which i argued that the gop desperately needed a better sort of centrist than the specteresque , socially liberal , fiscally conservative northeasterners to whom the label has usually been applied one theme in that piece , which has run through my commentary on the republican party ever since , is that a moderate wing of the gop that just imitates the democrats on a few issues where the liberal line is popular isn t necessarily doing either its party or the country any great favors to be truly constructive in their moderation , the gop s centrists should be advancing alternatives to popular liberal ideas trying to create a different center of political gravity , in effect , rather than just looking for ways to take some losing issues off the table for a case study of the latter , less constructive sort of centrism , consider the recent cluster of republican politicians mitt romney , most notably , but also tim pawlenty and some others who have spoken in favor of a minimum wage increase here is romney s morning joe sound bite on the issue i part company with many of the conservatives in my party on the issue of the minimum wage i think we ought to raise it , because frankly , our party is all about more jobs and better pay , and i think communicating that is important to us i also believe the key for our party is to be able to convince the people who are in the working population , particularly the hispanic community , that our party will help them get better jobs and better wages , and that s what our party s beliefs do the democratic party has shown that over the past five years of their leadership , income inequality has become worse and the policies of the past five years have not worked for hispanic families or africanamerican families , minority families have been the most hardhit during these past five years this is plausible as political analysis , and a good deal more sensible than some of the ideas that seemed to animate romney s presidential campaign but note that his raisethewage policy substance doesn t actually offer an alternative to these past five years of leadership it just concedes the policy ground in question to the obama white house , without so much as acknowledging the obvious point that with some economic policies there might be tradeoffs between more jobs and better pay , and that a minimum wage increase is almost certainly one of those cases in fairness to the prominimum wage republicans , there are various nuances here indexing the wage to inflation , as rick santorum has proposed , is better than just having periodic , politicallymotivated hikes , and the statebased minimum wage increases favored by some republican politicians would have fewer perverse effects than a federal increase and of course the minimum wage is a winning issue in the polls , and you can t win every policy battle but the case for tactical surrender would be a lot stronger if more republican politicians , and republican moderates especially , would first actually try to make the argument for an alternative , rightofcenter suite of policies on jobs and wages that could mean payroll tax cuts , it could mean an expanded earned income tax credit or \( as marco rubio has proposed \) a wage subsidy as a replacement for the eitc , it could mean some of the american enterprise institute s michael strain s proposals to help the unemployed there s a whole range of potential policies , and policy combinations , that might deliver some of the minimum wage increase s benefits with fewer downside risks many of these policies , of course , have critics and detractors on the smallgovernment right most of them require some form of funding or offset , whereas raising the minimum wage lets you pretend that you aren t raising taxes \( though you are , you are \) all of them require a little more explanation than just saying 1010 an hour \? i m for that ! but if you re in mitt romney s position , none of these problems should be obstacles , because you aren t running for office , you re already explicitly triangulating against many of the conservatives in my party , and you have the luxury of promoting policy on the merits at this point , rather than worrying about tomorrow s polls so why not use your megaphone \( such as it is \) to suggest that there might be a centerright answer on wages that s better than the white house s raisethewage campaign \? why not trade on your business background to explain why effectively taxing lowwage , lowskill hiring , as the minimum wage does , is a good way to get less of it \? and why not try to match the kind of policy experimentation that we ve seen lately , in different ways , from tea party figures like mike lee and rand paul , and prove that moderates can be reformers too \? thanks to phyllis schlafly , we think of a choice , not an echo as a slogan for the ideological right but the republican party and both parties , really would be in better shape if more moderates subscribed to it as well
remember when was spotted walking into a toronto strip club with a former exotic dancer \? wait that was his teammate alex rodriguez ok , but remember when jeter went to a manhattan diner to top off a threetequila night with an omelet and some waffles , only to be suckerpunched by some wannabe tough guy \? wait that was another teammate , david wells well , then , remember when jeter was spotted at a swingers club in dallas \? yeah , jeet ! hold on that was rodriguez , again ok , ok but remember all the times over his long career when a frustrated jeter kicked a gatorade jug \( a sponsor ! \) , slammed his bat against a dugout wall and had to be restrained from going after an opponent \? all the times when he was ejected \? wait none of that happened ever the jeter worship service that is this baseball season will end for its deity sunday at fenway park but before jeter is assumed into the baseball heavens , to be greeted at the players entrance by the yankee clipper , the mick and the sultan of swat hiya , kid ! let us consider what might be the man s greatest statistic in 20 years of living onstage in new york city , the socalled media capital of the world , derek jeter has never played ball he has never been caught in a compromising position he has never embarrassed himself after a long shift at the ballpark , he has never been known to ooze into one of those establishments that tabloids call jiggle joints , or to stumble out of some meatpackingdistrict hot spot after too much veuve clicquot this is n't to say that jeter has n't gone out at night , or that he has n't been photographed holding a beer , or that he did n't glower once at rodriguez after a botched infield popup but he will retire with his honor and privacy intact , leaving the world to know only that he was raised right by his parents , has dated models and movie stars , and , most revealingly , kept telling himself not to cry as he played his final game at yankee stadium on thursday night jeter s ability to maintain a posture of sustained inscrutability or , if you must , dignified comportment has extended especially to the spoken word that he is no ozzie smith at shortstop is well established statistically speaking , he s not even a gene michael but aside from a few notable exceptions \( throwing out jeremy giambi at home with that mindboggling flip in the 2001 playoffs \) , he has played his best defense in front of his locker catching every controversial question thrown to him and tossing it aside as if it were a scuffed ball unsuitable for play in a major league career that dates to the clinton administration s first term he is the only yankees shortstop a generation of fans has known inquiring reporters have gathered around jeter in the clubhouse thousands of times he has maintained eye contact , answered nearly every question posed to him and said nothing this is not a complaint , but rather an expression of awe of admiration , even his batting average and fielding percentage aside , this kid from kalamazoo , mich , entered the new york meat grinder two decades ago and came out the other end looking as sharp as joe dimaggio s suit diverting resources that might have been dedicated to crises greater than a ballplayer s retirement , the new york times recently conducted an analysis of thousands of jeter quotations it had recorded since his first major league game that was on may 29 , 1995 , when a reporter observed that he had handled an 0for5 performance with a veteran s aplomb veteran \? jeter said i 've got to get a hit first he was all of 20 but was already locked in focused on saying nothing that might be contorted into a nextday story line rookie remains cocky despite his zip of a day the analysis suggests that jeter does not rely on baseball clich s , the we 'll get 'em tomorrow , one game at a time waste of oxygen that can cause sportswriters to daydream of baseballfree winters but he does have pet phrases , like swinging the bat tex has been swinging the bat a lot better we 've been swinging the bats collectively guys are having good atbats , hitting balls hard , finding holes i'm not swinging the bat very well it s obvious jeter also often uses bottom line \( we need to swing the bats better that s the bottom line \) and does n't make a difference \( it does n't make a difference if guys are out of the lineup we could have brought back gehrig , ruth and dimaggio we just need to swing the bats better \) more interesting , though , is how often he has deflected or deflated an emerging narrative , whether provocative or benign , with certain goto phrases does n't mean is one in early june 2007 , for example , the yankees were several games under 500 but had managed to win three of their last four , prompting gaseous talk about momentum as they headed to chicago they lost , 64 , in the first game , though , as jeter made the final out with a man on first the postgame questions may not have asked him about his plans for october , but there was this uhoh feel to it all , reflected in the times s the next day yankees' revival takes a wrong turn jeter sounded like an adult lecturing children about perspective just because we lost does n't mean there was a letdown in early 2012 , the story line was that jeter , at 37 , might be showing his age a notion that made him bristle \( if one can bristle politely \) after a fourhit game in late april , he said , everyone is getting older , but just because you 've gotten older does n't mean you ca n't do things a couple of months later , he turned 38 and he went on to bat 316 and lead the american league in hits another popular tool of redirection is no big deal in august 2005 , jeter had an ice pack around his bruised right thumb after a game it s really no big deal in june 2006 , he strained his right hand , left a game early and went 0 for 5 the next day it s no big deal but in september 2012 , when he left a game after landing awkwardly on first base , jeter changed it up i just jammed my ankle it s not a big deal i 'd be lying if i ca n't worry about my job is to this is largely how jeter has managed to avoid the tag of controversy , all in an environment in which a misplaced adverb might spark a tabloid conflagration he has not been tightly wound so much as in complete control , always , demonstrating extreme emotion with little more than a pumped fist his way of expressing displeasure over a called strike , for example , has been to bow his head and talk as if to home plate , so as not to show up the umpire but this is new york city and jeter plays for the new york yankees franchise , in which every crotch tug and spit spray is analyzed for its impact on the pinstripe kingdom what s more , jeter played most of his career for george steinbrenner , the longtime yankees owner who was so complicated that writers had run out of applicable adjectives by 1980 for several years , jeter avoided the wrath from olympus but in early 2003 , steinbrenner publicly suggested that jeter s bachelor lifestyle had affected his performance during the 2002 season , when the yankees failed to reach the world series for the first time in five years \( cleveland indians fans howl at the thought \) among the many cherished yankee traditions was one in which players and managers countered steinbrenner s tirades with rants of their own but jeter s response somehow managed to convey both anger and respect he s the boss and he s entitled to his opinion , right or wrong , but what he said has been turned into me being this big party animal , jeter told the associated press he even made a reference to one birthday party that s been turned into that i'm like dennis rodman now i do n't think that s fair i have no problems with people criticizing how i play but it bothers me when people question my work ethic how did the two men resolve their differences \? by appearing together in a , of course jeter won the argument , kept his dignity and got a paycheck out of it jeter has occasionally been criticized for petulance over these many years , but they hinge on moments when , characteristically , he has not said enough in 2007 , in the mix of his hotandcold relationship with rodriguez who , some say , should have been the one playing shortstop jeter dismissed suggestions that as the team s captain , he should encourage fans to show more support for rodriguez it s not my job to change the way fans act , he said , adding why would you even get caught up in that \? it s not your job to tell fans what to do , bottom line bottom line there s that catchphrase again if nothing else , these scattered moments of churlishness confirm that if pricked , jeter does bleed , which became evident during contract negotiations four years ago although the yankees have cashed in handsomely on this yearlong jeterfest , back then they publicly invited their aging shortstop to test the market before reaching a threeyear deal with the clearly wounded jeter , who thought his desire to end his career in new york was well known to hear the organization tell me to go shop it when i just told you i was n't going to if i'm going to be honest with you , i was angry about it , he said that was that , and another season began these bittersweet final days of jeter s baseball career at times have been what s the word \? absurd absurd in the overboard and lucrative adulation , yes , but also in the snarky backlash that the worship has engendered against a superior ballplayer who stuck with one team and always played his hardest the most genuine moment came thursday night , after jeter played his final game at yankee stadium , which he won with a gameending hit no unnecessary speeches no awkward presentation of gaudy and useless gifts just jeter , partly revealed during the game , he was so emotional that he had to compose himself in the clubhouse , and so nervous in the field that he prayed the ball would not come to him but now that it was over , he thanked the fans thanked the yankees wished the team he had just beaten , the baltimore orioles , the best of luck in a postseason that will not include him took a final walk around the infield , waved his cap once more and was gone the deification of derek jeter will soon abate , to be resurrected when he is inducted five years from now into the communion of saints , the baseball hall of fame his bronze plaque will list the more than 3 , 460 hits , the 309 career batting average , the five world series championships , on and on and above these statistics will appear the face of dignity intact , under a yankees cap bottom line
it was hard to watch president obama during tuesday s state of the union address and not see a man who has had his coat trimmed and his ambitions adjusted he touted his accomplishments , as he should have , but in laying out the parameters of his year of action he outlined goals that did n't ask america to dream as much as adjust to the paralysis , abandoning big moves for smaller ones republican lawmakers have made clear that they have no desire to work with him and that they have every intention of opposing him , even if that means the legislative branch passes almost no laws and that s exactly what they 've done in december , using public laws passed or bills passed as the measurement , the 113th congress has passed just 58 laws so far , the lowest since 1947 so , the president pledged tuesday that he would work with congress where he could , but would move forward without congress if necessary , saying , wherever and whenever i can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more american families , that s what i'm going to do his plans were noble enough , and they were pollfriendly raising the minimum wage , working for universal highquality prek , equal pay for women , a new myra retirement savings plan but they are not nearly large enough proposals to solve our most intractable problems there was only one line devoted to fixing our upsidedown tax code for individuals , and that was in reference to the retirement account gone were the appeals to get congress to have the wealthy pay their fair share last year , the president put it this way we ca n't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful he continued most americans democrats , republicans and independents understand that we ca n't just cut our way to prosperity they know that broadbased economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction , with spending cuts and revenue , and with everybody doing their fair share last year , on the issue of new gun control legislation , the president said it has been two months since newtown i know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence but this time is different overwhelming majorities of americans americans who believe in the second amendment have come together around commonsense reform , like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun this year , he mentioned gun violence only once , saying citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day the only big proposal that even has a chance this year is comprehensive immigration reform , and its prospects are far from certain last year , the president spoke extensively about passing immigration reform , repeating , now is the time to do it now is the time to get it done now is the time to get it done he spoke about stronger border security , a pathway to citizenship and decreasing waiting times for highly skilled immigrants this year , he spoke of immigration in a single passage , with no specifics other than to cite this independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost 1 trillion in the next two decades the president seems to have been reduced by the resistance he seems to be concentrating on what can be done rather than on what should be done this is a rational reaction , i suppose , to irrational opposition , but nonetheless it s a sad indictment of our politics the president has had failures and missteps , to be sure every administration has some none are perfect but the idea of grinding government to a halt in opposition to one leader as republicans have done has been an extraordinary and infuriating thing to behold and it has been sad to watch a president full of hope and promise be stymied at nearly every turn and have to reframe his objectives in in the new yorker , obama attempted to give context to his struggles and place his term in the long sweep of history and i think america was very lucky that abraham lincoln was president when he was president if he had n't been , the course of history would be very different but i also think that , despite being the greatest president , in my mind , in our history , it took another hundred and fifty years before africanamericans had anything approaching formal equality , much less real equality i think that does n't diminish lincoln s achievements , but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we 're part of a longrunning story we just try to get our paragraph right the president who was fond of proclaiming that under his leadership , the country was beginning a new chapter on everything from to , is now just trying to get his paragraph right
kabul , afghanistan the two remaining candidates for president of afghanistan said on thursday that they accepted the final results of the first round of voting , which eliminated their other rivals , and they vowed to campaign hard to win the election in a runoff however , the timeline announced by the nation s election commission will leave the country without a new president until late summer voters will cast their runoff ballots on june 14 , with final results to be announced on july 22 under afghan election law , the new president would then be inaugurated 30 days later , officials said the dates matter to the united states and other western countries , where military planners are hoping to determine as soon as possible what will happen after the current united nations mandate for their forces in afghanistan expires at the end of the year both candidates have said they will sign the bilateral security agreement that has already been negotiated with the united states , and which provides for the continuing presence of american troops the current president , hamid karzai , has refused to sign it before he leaves office , leaving the matter to his successor the american ambassador to afghanistan , james b cunningham , issued a statement saying the united states applauded the election results and urged afghans to hold a credible , inclusive and transparent second round mr cunningham also called on both candidates' campaigns neither to commit fraud nor to permit it to be conducted in their names the independent election commission of afghanistan said the frontrunner in the race , abdullah abdullah , won 45 percent of the vote in the first round , with ashraf ghani second at 316 percent they will meet in the runoff the thirdplace candidate , zalmay rassoul , won 114 percent , and said he would support mr abdullah s campaign in the runoff by the commission s final count , 7 , 018 , 049 afghans went to the polls in the first round on april 5 , about 50 percent more than voted in the previous presidential election , in 2009 the commission s chairman , mohammed yousuf nuristani , said 64 percent of the voters were men and 36 percent were women my request again of the brave and patriotic people of afghanistan is to do as they did before , millions of them casting their votes , to go again and cast their votes in the runoff , mr nuristani said at a news conference thursday under afghan law , a candidate must win more than 50 percent of the votes to be elected if none do so in a first round of voting , a runoff is held the independent election commission oversees the voting and counting , while a separate body , the electoral complaints commission , adjudicates reports of irregularities and fraud in contrast to 2009 , when more than 12 million votes were found to be fraudulent and were discarded , the two commissions threw out only 375 , 000 votes this time before the results were announced , mr abdullah had complained about lastminute changes in election rules , improper counting and other aberrations but on thursday he chose to take the high road , sounding an almost triumphal note anyway , the story is over the others are 14 percent or 135 percent behind , mr abdullah said , referring to mr ghani he added that , with support in the runoff from several candidates who had smaller showings , he expected to win the next round easily mr ghani , on the other hand , criticized the complaint commission and said it should have discarded closer to 800 , 000 votes he sought to rally his own supporters and those of mr rassoul , saying , together , the victory is ours though mr rassoul threw his personal support to mr abdullah for the runoff , many of his backers did not follow suit it is difficult to forecast how the runoff will turn out , despite mr abdullah s substantial lead in the first round ethnic fault lines may play a bigger role in the second round than they did in the first in particular , pashtuns , the largest group in the country , see themselves as underrepresented in kabul , and mr ghani , who is a pashtun , may be able to tap into that resentment and win votes that were cast for others in the first round mr abdullah is half pashtun and half tajik , but is heavily identified with the tajik ethnic group whoever wins the runoff had better do so by a wide margin , said a former adviser to one of the campaigns , who asked not to be identified because of sensitive negotiations among candidates there has to be a megagap between the winner and the loser for the winner to have a mandate , and for the loser not to turn into a sore loser and create a crisis , the former adviser said if it ends up being 5248 or 5048 , then that s not accepted three percent is a margin of error in this country

played his final game for the on april 23 , 1978 , going scoreless off the bench as the philadelphia 76ers closed out a fourgame sweep in the eastern conference semifinal series for jackson , it was a quiet ending to a fine tenure with the knicks , which included two titles he became a fan favorite he grew an extraordinary mustache his time in manhattan was well spent one could not have predicted what was ahead the highprofile partnerships with michael jordan and kobe bryant , the championships and the triumphs his only involvement with the knicks came when he coached against them he usually won on tuesday , jackson will return to madison square garden in a different role , as the knicks' new president after a 36year absence , jackson , now 68 , has agreed to head the front office of a team that needs help lots of it here is a look at some of the challenges that await jackson in a process that may take a while and has no guarantee of success the knicks need better players this is the fundamental problem one can only assume that this is the primary reason the team s owner , , handed jackson a cartoonsize check to come aboard if the knicks were contenders , or at least competent , steve mills might still be in charge of the team s basketball operations and jackson might still be home in playa del rey , calif the unfortunate corollary to the current challenge the knicks not being very good is that the team could look similar next season eight players are under contract for 201415 , including amar'e stoudemire , tyson chandler and andrea bargnani , who will earn a combined 50 million their contracts alone will put the knicks against the salary cap , which was 587 million this season loose translation jackson could be one of the sharpest basketball minds of his generation or any other , but he will not have the financial flexibility to comb the freeagent market until 2015 , when the contracts of stoudemire , chandler and bargnani come off the books are we forgetting something \? oh , and his stated desire to test free agency this summer it will be up to jackson , assuming he thinks it is the right move , to persuade anthony to stay but at what price \? the knicks can offer anthony the most lucrative contract under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement five years and 129 million but anthony recently said he would be willing to take less if the knicks were to present him with a viable plan for the future jackson could be the first part of such a plan no coach in the nba has probably faced greater scrutiny this season than mike woodson in the absence of any public show of support from the front office , woodson has been subject to unrelenting questions about his job security it happened again saturday , when woodson was asked whether he thought the final weeks of the season would double as a sort of referendum on his future with the team \( woodson said he did not feel that way \) it seems unlikely that woodson will be the coach next season yes , the knicks have been hindered by injuries yes , the offseason acquisition of bargnani turned out to be a disaster yes , the team systematically destroyed the confidence of iman shumpert by dangling him as trade bait throughout the season and although much of the responsibility for those missteps falls on the front office a front office that is now having a regime change woodson is ultimately the man in charge of this ragtag , underperforming team if jackson decides to move in a new direction , and all indications are that he will , a coaching search would be fascinating jackson is the most decorated coach in nba history he won 11 championships with the chicago bulls and the los angeles lakers , with a knack for getting supremely talented players to buy into his oneforall , sharingiscaring philosophies with the knicks , jackson could work as a mentor for a younger coach perhaps one of his former players , perhaps someone familiar with the triangle offense if jackson truly wants to change the culture , from the top down , it would make sense for him to have a coach who operates as a surrogate , with the same messages and the same principles after all , the jackson way has already worked 11 times why not 12 \? jackson will head a front office that signed chris smith , the younger , overmatched brother of j r based on that decision alone , this is a team of executives that could use some guidance , an overhaul or at least someone strong enough to stand up to the owner the top executives in the nba use all the tools at their disposal , everything from advanced analytics to oldschool scouting , and it is a foregone conclusion that jackson will have several people who will do much of the legwork required to execute whatever changes he wants to make above all , jackson will operate as something of a grand overseer , half philosopher and half architect , a man with a macro vision who has a supporting cast that does the micro work as for who will be part of that staff , and what their roles will be those are questions that will be answered in the coming days , weeks and months it seems likely that jackson will retain mills , who has a rapport with the players and was involved in the negotiations that brought jackson aboard at the same time , jackson could be the team s biggest asset in its search for more talent on monday , anthony told reporters that jackson would be a magnet for top free agents which sounds great , except the knicks will need to free up space under the salary cap before that is even feasible so much damage has already been done , and much of it impossible to undo jackson will need to build from the ground up the longsuffering and the woebegone the disaffected and the disillusioned we are referring , of course , to the collective plight of the team s fans , for whom the pursuit of another championship has turned into years of wobbling down a dark road to disappointment so many bloated contracts so many squandered draft picks so much false hope while none of this is news , jackson brings something altogether different to the organization success he is a symbol of all that is possible , and his mere presence is enough to boost the morale of those who root for this team this is no small achievement fans matter they buy the tickets \( those that go unconsumed by corporate sponsors , anyway \) they foot the cable bills they guzzle the 11 beers it was less than two weeks ago that a group called knick fans 4 life announced plans to stage a protest outside madison square garden before a coming game since then , the knicks have won five straight as part of a sixgame winning streak , and they hired jackson the protest , still scheduled for wednesday , has lost some of its angst the knicks have an outside shot at a playoff berth , and one of the game s most renowned winners is joining the organization jackson has yet to make a move the knicks have not even made an announcement but for fans accustomed to being down in the dumps , jackson s arrival might be enough for them to feel vaguely optimistic for a change all that aforementioned optimism comes with an important caveat his name is james l dolan it will be up to jackson to shape the roster into a contender it will be up to jackson to rejigger the front office so the team makes smart decisions it will be up to jackson to settle on a coach who can turn all the pieces into a winner but none of that happens if the man who owns the team gets in the way no team president can expect total autonomy the owner signs the checks , after all but jackson has accomplished everything in the game that dolan has not , and it behooves dolan to give jackson a wide berth to allow him to evaluate personnel , communicate with his staff and refurbish the roster dolan has given similar assurances to employees in the notsodistant past in 2008 , donnie walsh arrived to run the team with the expectation that he would be free from interference and meddling two staples of the dolan era walsh was given relative independence for a while , and then he objected to the notion of trading nearly half the roster \( and several draft picks \) for anthony the trade happened , and walsh soon departed , replaced by glen grunwald given the way dolan has often churned through executives , there is some reason to believe that his relationship with jackson will inevitably end up as more of the same a nice honeymoon , followed by a relatively quick divorce jackson deserves a full opportunity to do things his way but will he get it \?
washington in on wednesday that was part math problem and part seminar on the nature of culpability , the justices seemed to agree on just two things the first was that doyle r paroline , convicted in 2009 of possessing 280 images of child pornography , is a bad guy , as justice antonin scalia put it the second was that the child shown in two of those images had suffered terrible harm , first from sexual assaults committed by another man two decades ago and then from the mass circulation of depictions of her abuse the woman has undergone serious psychiatric harm because of her knowledge that there are thousands of people out there viewing her rape , justice scalia said beyond those two points , though , the justices seemed at a loss to identify a principled way to determine what mr paroline owes amy , as the woman is known in court papers allows the victims of child pornography to seek restitution from people convicted of viewing images of their abuse amy s lawyers say her losses , for a lifetime of therapy , lost income and legal bills , add up to 34 million the three lawyers who appeared before the court on wednesday offered varying answers to the question of what mr paroline owes amy , and none of their arguments seemed to satisfy the justices stanley g schneider , a lawyer for mr paroline , said his client owed amy nothing , because the link between his conduct and her losses was too remote and hard to trace justice ruth bader ginsburg said the words of the 1994 law appeared to require an award of at least some money several other justices seemed to agree if only one person viewed the pornography , that person would be responsible for the entire damages , justice elena kagan said but if a thousand people viewed the pornography and the harm was that much greater , nobody would be on the hook for restitution how could that possibly make sense \? amy s lawyer , paul g cassell , a former federal judge , made the argument at the other extreme he said amy was entitled to collect all 34 million from mr paroline , citing a part of the 1994 law that allows victims of child pornography to seek the full amount in restitution from people convicted of producing , distributing or possessing it in in 2012 , the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit , in new orleans , agreed , relying on the legal doctrine of joint and several liability mr paroline should pay what he could of the full amount , the court said , and seek contributions from his fellow wrongdoers if he thought it was too much mr cassell said this was the only sensible approach and the only one faithful to the words of the 1994 law amy s losses , he said , come from a vast faceless , anonymous crowd of thousands of people scattered around the globe from denver to denmark who are looking at pictures of her being raped as an 8yearold girl he said at least 70 , 000 people had viewed the images of amy she should not be put to the burden of filing literally thousands and thousands of cases for piecemeal restitution , he said , and collecting as little as 47 under some of the calculation theories that the government has proposed but justice stephen g breyer said there must be a limiting principle , because you do n't require a person to pay what he did n't cause michael r dreeben , a lawyer for the federal government , suggested a middle ground , saying that trial judges should try to allocate amy s losses among various offenders the idea seemed appealing to some justices , but they struggled to find a principled and practical way to apply it if you knew that it had been viewed by a thousand people , is a psychologist able to say that her knowledge that it has been viewed by a thousand people causes this much harm \? justice samuel a alito jr asked and once she learns that it s now been viewed by a thousand and one people , there s a little bit of additional harm \? justice ginsburg noted that the man who assaulted amy , her uncle , had been made to pay her just 6 , 325 he was sentenced to 12 years in prison if there s any kind of proportionality , she said , it seems that the possessor of two images should not be responsible for more than the person who perpetrated this horrendous crime mr dreeben proposed various formulas for allocating the losses , but he admitted that they lacked precision and did not work well in all circumstances he mentioned the possibility of a 50 percent fudge factor justice scalia resisted such a freeform approach in the case , paroline v united states , no 128561 there is such a thing as due process of law , he said
aldeburgh , england when the party s over and you 've got the stains out of the carpet , what then \? it s a question that the , which partied hard last year for the and could fairly have allowed itself a quiet 2014 to recover , is asking itself but quiet was n't the word for the recent opening of the new season , which runs through sunday and carries a warrelated theme \( for the anniversaries of world war i and dday , high on british cultural agendas just now \) it opened with britten s owen wingrave an opera based on the henry james story of a young man who defies his family s expectations by refusing to become a soldier an emphatic statement of the composer s lifelong pacifist convictions , it was directed by neil bartlett , conducted by mark wigglesworth , and staged in the rural idyll of snape maltings concert hall in southeast england , where the piece  there was no audience out front for the '71 opening , because wingrave was a opera made for television filmed at snape but broadcast to the nation s sitting rooms that massive , instant audience gave the piece an unusually high profile at the time but it was destined for an awkward afterlife when it transferred eventually to the stage where it does work , but only with some effort to accommodate an intimate , crosscutting presentation style designed for television cameras with the added challenge of a pacifist agenda so sincere and earnest it is potentially a handicap , wingrave has come to be regarded as a piece that requires special pleading to make its case and the problem with this latest aldeburgh effort is that the case is n't made it shrewdly broadens out the pacifism theme into a narrative of male aggression in society at large but the production forgets until too late that this is also a victorian ghost story in which the protagonist , owen , has to deal not only with his present family but with the spirits of his ancestors none of whom are friendly at the opera s end he answers accusations of cowardice by agreeing to sleep in a haunted room , where the spirits kill him but to believe in all this requires a production that sets up the supernatural dimension from the start and mr bartlett s does n't there s no sense of the ancestors , of the house they stalk , or of the suffocating claustrophobia in the score and the whole hauntedroom finale is messy an achievement for a show done with so minimal a set musically , the show has more to offer wingrave may have been written for the intimacy of television , but it requires a substantial orchestra that limits performing opportunities so the composer david matthews \( who once worked as britten s assistant \) has made a chamberscale reduction and it is miraculously done , losing none of the vibrant colors in a score that rejected the austerity of britten s 1960s church operas and resumed the luxuriance of an earlier style mr wigglesworth holds everything together with judicious expertise , occasionally sacrificing urgency for clarity and the cast rises to the challenge of a piece that takes eight , nearequalstatus soloists and exposes them to scrutiny without supplying quite enough material to flesh out the bones of their characters susan bullock , best known for her wagner heroines , is terrifying as the maiden aunt miss wingrave catherine backhouse sings the fierce fianc e kate with relish and there s a triumphant debut from the young british baritone ross ramgobin , who finds a way to sing the title role with clarity and beauty yet still show himself a fighter which is just as it should be , because the message of this opera is that pacifism is not passive it commits to conflict , albeit through battles of ideas , not blood as for the rest of aldeburgh s opening weekend , it was tempting to call richard goode s snape maltings piano recital an example of keyboard pacifism in that it was a calm , compelling , quietly reasoned program of janacek , schumann and debussy delivered like a secret between friends mr goode s selfdeprecating musical intelligence fulfilled the brief , and more by contrast , there was an extraordinary concert of french twopiano repertoire at nearby blythburgh church that went off like a crate of ammunition it featured works by messiaen , debussy and ravel composed in , or suggesting , times of war and its climax was a shattering account by pierrelaurent aimard with tamara stefanovich of messiaen s epic visions de l'amen a musical analogue of muscular christianity that proclaims the composer s faith with pulverizing force and the persistence of a charismatic preacher calling on you to believe by its conclusion , we believed like saints magnificently played with thrilling if exhausting fervor , this was one of the most memorable aldeburgh festival experiences and proof that even if mr aimard is n't a pianist for all repertoire \( he 'd never be my choice for austrogerman classics \) his authority on home ground is unchallengeable messiaen is home ground with a vengeance for explosive musicmaking , though , the festival excelled itself with a bizarre event at snape in which the chamber choir exaudi sang the socalled earthquake mass by the renaissance french composer antoine brumel written in 12 parts , the texture of this mass is rich a great noise in its own right but at snape the noise was amplified by the addition of an electronic barrage , specially commissioned to create the earthquake promised by the title it was brutal , deafening , and so close to crossing health and safety thresholds that the festival gave everybody in the audience a set of earplugs and a warning at your own risk , a comparatively novel concept in the world of classical performance
spokane , wash the fun began long before north dakota state coach saul phillips , in the middle of a news conference friday \( the man has turned scripted drudgery into performance art \) , asked his boss for a raise phillips joked that he got the job in the first place because he had pictures of his boss , the athletic director , who just laughed i can rip them up now , phillips said in the afterglow of the university s first ncaa tournament victory , an 8075 overtime win over oklahoma on thursday i'm safe it truly began seven years ago , when phillips was a north dakota state assistant and the head coach , tim miles , left for colorado state \( he now coaches nebraska \) phillips went to the office of the athletic director , gene taylor please , please , give me the chance , ' taylor recalled phillips saying he literally pounded on my desk every spring , it seems , a littleknown team and a big personality emerge from the chaos of the ncaa tournament to capture more than an equal share of attention this year , the first candidates are north dakota state and phillips , 41 the bison , seeded 12th in the west region , play the no 4 seed san diego state on saturday no one , at least this side of mercer , is having more fun than north dakota state and no collegiate athletic department is riding a bigger crest of momentum about as good as it gets , taylor said the football team has won three consecutive national championships in the division i football championship subdivision the one with the playoffs , not the bowls the past four years , the bison have beaten upperdivision kansas , minnesota , colorado state and kansas state but thursday s basketball victory was bigger , taylor said such things are hard to measure , but taylor told the story of a friend who wore a north dakota state jacket into a washington , dc , bar to watch thursday s game the bar erupted in excitement when guard lawrence alexander made a 3pointer to force overtime , and patrons cheered the bison to victory , 3 , 000 miles from spokane and a world away from the college s campus in fargo he told me , the next thing i know , i had 17 beers in front of me for free , ' taylor said of his friend the victory gives north dakota state unusual and unexpected attention and no one handles attention better than phillips i mean , he s goofy , crazy at times , but a great coach to play for , alexander said on friday , phillips went to the spot on the spokane arena floor where alexander released his shot phillips bent down and kissed it two big lip marks right there , phillips said phillips , married and the father of three , was raised in wisconsin and played at wisconsinplatteville for bo ryan , now the head coach at wisconsin he spent two seasons as an assistant to ryan and , later , three years as his operations manager he came to north dakota state in 2004 as an assistant to miles what makes phillips different is that he is the rare basketball coach who appears to have fun coaching he credits that to his time with miles , during lean years as north dakota state transitioned from division ii to division i during one game , players were a bit out of control , and phillips recommended they slow the tempo miles disagreed we 're not very good right now , phillips recalled miles s saying but we 're not going to be bad and boring let s have some fun for phillips , who said that he came out of the womb with a smile on my face , it has been a core coaching philosophy i could try to be ornery and negative , and that would be fake , phillips said i ca n't do that in the very corporate , cold world of college basketball , that s just not my personality i get the fact there s a business attached to it , but i do n't deal with that they have athletic directors that deal with the money side of it i deal with a bunch of kids running around in shorts and that s a pretty good place to be it was one of his more serious responses on friday phillips uses reporters like straight men \( and women \) among his more notable responses to a string of serious questions on the san diego state star guard xavier thames i'm hoping there s an elevator malfunction , and he gets caught in the elevator on the physical play against oklahoma last night , the locker room looked like chuck wepner after a fight on the team s battered faces , including that of marshall bjorklund marshall s got a nose he can smell around corners , man on competing against san diego state coach steve fisher he gets to recruit to san diego beaches , weather it s just not fair i mean , they should spot us 10 points we 're in fargo we have got beaches , but the lake s frozen over the whole time , so it does n't make any difference \( later , he extolled the virtues of fargo , with its young population and energy now , it s cold , he said bring a jacket you can take it off when you get inside \) the humor is contagious among the players , none of whom had scholarship offers from bigger , betterknown basketball programs \( we 're the great unwashed , phillips said \) after the game , when phillips said of alexander , i love him and he s a winner , alexander replied , i love you , too , saul guard taylor braun , the summit league player of the year , joked that the game was no big deal honestly , i do n't know what all the hype is about , he said \( he quickly conceded that it was unbelievable and that the atmosphere was 100 times greater than expected \) bjorklund , whom phillips takes great pride in announcing is a pig farmer , was asked about the rough play against oklahoma i guess down low it was almost like a bar fight , bjorklund said so you hear , phillips said so you hear taylor , the athletic director , knows that bigger programs may soon be trying to lure phillips north dakota state s football coach , craig bohl , recently left for a bigger opportunity we reupped saul last year , taylor said , referring to phillips s contract but i just reupped my football coach last year , too , and he went to wyoming
doral , fla closing out a pga tour victory is like starting a family many dream of doing it , but the reality is often more stressful than imagined no matter how many times a golfer visualizes it or how thoroughly he prepares for it , there is no way of knowing how he will react until he is in the situation a golfer can no sooner practice hitting a shot to win his first tournament than he can rehearse caring for a firstborn with a high fever brandt snedeker , a sixtime tour winner and father of two , said the first couple of times you 're in contention , you have no clue how to act it s kind of like having your first kid you 're calling your doctor 24 hours a day the first five weeks the only difference is , on the golf course you have no one to call but yourself wind and water could conspire to turn sunday s final round of the world golf championships event at doral resort and spa into the tournament of tourniquets , awash in hemorrhaging leads in other words , a repeat of last sunday s honda classic , when the leader board was a kaleidoscope of changing names as one contender after another took a tumble in a panoply of pratfalls that included water balls and wayward putts by the end of a fourman playoff , won on the first extra hole by russell henley , rory mcilroy , a twotime major winner in the midst of an 18month tour title drought , was talking about learning from his mistakes and eventually walking through the door ryan palmer was finding a silver lining in his deliberate pace , and russell knox was expressing delight at being able to trust his ability if walking through the door remains difficult for someone like mcilroy , who blew the doors off at the 2011 and the 2012 pga championship , it raises this question does winning ever get easy , and is there any way to practice being perfect under pressure \? there s no better way for me to prepare than to be in it , said mcilroy , who was tied for 19th at three over par , seven strokes off the lead , through 54 holes here at the cadillac championship he added i guess it s like riding a bike so the first few times you get back into contention , you have to get used to it again , but you know how to do it some would argue it is less like riding a bike than like piloting a fighter jet , where survival and success are mixed in an adrenaline cocktail henley said he craved the rush of contending , with his stomach fluttering and his extremities tingling if i get into a situation like that where i worked so hard to get there , final group on a sunday , and i do n't enjoy it , i feel like something s probably wrong , henley said mcilroy was not thinking of henley , who has two tour titles in 34 starts , when he said , once you get into contention enough , you get into the habit of it and the knack of it , i guess you have momentum on your side just as perfection is the enemy of achievement , so can adrenaline be the enemy of momentum snedeker , who said he drops five to six pounds from his 6foot1inch frame during major tournament weeks because of stress , added that he had tried playing practice rounds between swigs of caffeine and taurinerich red bull to simulate the jitters he feels when in contention dustin johnson , one of the four 36hole leaders here , said he liked to turn practice rounds during tournament weeks into money games , to raise the stakes and his heart rate to become more comfortable playing with a racing heart , some golfers will perform sets of pushups or jumping jacks between shots in practice rounds in his work with young golfers , oliver morton , a biomechanics and performance consultant from scotland whose clients include the world no 39 , stephen gallacher , alternates sets of calisthenics with shooting during the final round of the honda classic , morton wrote on twitter , swings do n't win tournaments , people do it was a reminder to his followers that attention must be paid to the golfers' temperament and tempo and not just their tools and technique watching from afar the recent struggles of tiger woods , the world no 1 , morton said there s been a lot of talk about tiger and his technique i 've wondered if it s a technical problem or an emotional thing from watching him on the range , his swing and tempo , his tension level is much lower on the course , his tension levels seem to go through the roof some golfers turn to for help corralling their emotions , using meditative and breathing exercises to reduce their levels of the hormone cortisol under stress katherine roberts , the founder of yoga for golf , encourages her students to inhale for four counts and exhale for six at a glance , she can pick out the golfers on a crowded practice range who are not breathing properly gary woodland , a twotime tour winner , calms himself by counting to four in his head before every shot it s a habit he learned on the basketball court woodland spent one season playing for division ii washburn university in kansas , where he converted 872 percent of his free throws he said foul shooting , like hitting a golf ball , is mentally challenging because you stand alone with your thoughts and initiate the action the counting just helps me block out everything , he said others have to remember to talk at last year s masters , jason day made birdies on nos 13 , 14 and 15 during the final round to vault into the lead at the par3 16th , he hit a seveniron long and made the first of backtoback bogeys the rush that i got through my body after i birdied 15 was amazing , day said to have the lead there and go , oh , man , i only have three holes left , if i can play well from here i 'll be the first australian to win it' i was so pumped and so amped that it got to me day communicated none of what he was feeling to his longtime coach and caddie , colin swatton he was so fired up , he clammed up and hurried up he ended up two strokes out of a playoff , won by his compatriot adam scott i think if i was in that situation again , day said , i probably would have slowed down a lot more , just kind of talked to col a little bit more and really talked everything through so that all the information is gathered and i can execute the shot that i need to during the last hour of the honda classic , henley said , he carried on a conversation unrelated to golf with his caddie , adam hayes it was not intended as a relaxation strategy the reason i'm talking is not to improve my golf game , henley said the reason i'm talking is i enjoy my life
in the fall of 2008 , a 30yearold computer expert named zarrar shah roamed from outposts in the northern mountains of pakistan to safe houses near the arabian sea , plotting mayhem in mumbai , s commercial gem mr shah , the technology chief of , the pakistani terror group , and fellow conspirators used google earth to show militants the routes to their targets in the city he set up an internet phone system to disguise his location by routing his calls through new jersey shortly before an , including six americans , mr shah searched online for a jewish hostel and two luxury hotels , all sites of the eventual carnage but he did not know that by september , the british were spying on many of his online activities , tracking his internet searches and messages , according to former american and indian officials and classified documents disclosed by edward j snowden , the former national security agency contractor they were not the only spies watching mr shah drew similar scrutiny from an indian intelligence agency , according to a former official briefed on the operation the united states was unaware of the two agencies' efforts , american officials say , but had picked up signs of a plot through other electronic and human sources , and warned indian security officials several times in the months before the attack what happened next may rank among the most devastating nearmisses in the history of spycraft the intelligence agencies of the three nations did not pull together all the strands gathered by their hightech surveillance and other tools , which might have allowed them to disrupt a terror strike so scarring that it is often called india s 9 11 no one put together the whole picture , said shivshankar menon , who was india s foreign secretary at the time of the attacks and later became the national security adviser not the americans , not the brits , not the indians mr menon , now retired , recalled that only once the shooting started did everyone share what they had , largely in meetings between british and indian officials , and then the picture instantly came into focus the british had access to a trove of data from mr shah s communications , but contend that the information was not specific enough to detect the threat the indians did not home in on the plot even with the alerts from the united states clues slipped by the americans as well , a pakistaniamerican who scouted targets in mumbai , exchanged incriminating emails with plotters that went unnoticed until shortly before his arrest in chicago in late 2009 united states counterterrorism agencies did not pursue reports from his unhappy wife , who told american officials long before the killings began that he was a pakistani terrorist conducting mysterious missions in mumbai that hidden history of the mumbai attacks reveals the vulnerability as well as the strengths of computer surveillance and intercepts as a counterterrorism weapon , an investigation by the new york times , and the pbs series has found although electronic eavesdropping often yields valuable data , even tantalizing clues can be missed if the technology is not closely monitored , the intelligence gleaned from it is not linked with other information , or analysis does not sift incriminating activity from the ocean of digital data this account has been pieced together from classified documents , court files and dozens of interviews with current and former indian , british and american officials while telephone intercepts of the assault team s phone calls and other intelligence work during the threeday siege have been reported , the extensive espionage that took place before the attacks has not previously been disclosed some details of the operations were withheld at the request of the intelligence agencies , citing national security concerns we did n't see it coming , a former senior united states intelligence official said we were focused on many other things al qaeda , the taliban , pakistan s , the iranians it s not that things were missed they were never put together after the assault began , the countries quickly disclosed their intelligence to one another they monitored a lashkar control room in pakistan where the terror chiefs directed their men , hunkered down in the taj and oberoi hotels and the jewish hostel , according to current and former american , british and indian officials that cooperation among the spy agencies helped analysts retrospectively piece together a complete operations plan for the attacks , a topsecret nsa document said the indian government did not respond to several requests for official comment , but a former indian intelligence official acknowledged that indian spies had tracked mr shah s laptop communications it is unclear what data the indians gleaned from their monitoring asked if government communications headquarters , or gchq , s eavesdropping agency , should have had strong suspicions of a looming attack , a government official responded in a statement we do not comment on intelligence matters but if we had had critical information about an imminent act of terrorism in a situation like this we would have shared it with the indian government so the central allegation of this story is completely untrue the attacks still resonate in india , and are a continuing source of tension with pakistan last week , a pakistani court to a militant commander , zakiurrehman lakhvi , accused of being an orchestrator of the attacks he has not been freed , pending an appeal india protested his release , arguing it was part of a pakistani effort to avoid prosecution of terror suspects the story of the mumbai killings has urgent implications for the west s duel with the islamic state and other groups like lashkar , the islamic state s stealthy communications and slick propaganda make it one of the world s most technologically sophisticated terror organizations al qaeda , which recently announced the creation of an affiliate in india , uses similar tools although the united states computer arsenal plays a vital role against targets ranging from north korea s suspected assault on sony to russian cyberthieves and chinese military hacking units , counterterrorism requires a complex mix of human and technical resources some former counterterrorism officials warn against promoting billiondollar surveillance programs with the narrow argument that they stop attacks that monitoring collects valuable information , but large amounts of it are never meaningfully reviewed or analyzed , said charles \( sam \) faddis , a retired cia counterterrorism chief i cannot remember a single instance in my career when we ever stopped a plot based purely on signals intelligence the targeting of mr shah s communications also failed to detect mr headley s role in the mumbai attacks , and national security agency officials did not see for months that he was pursuing a new attack in denmark there are small successes in all of this that do n't make up for all the deaths , said tricia bacon , a former state department intelligence analyst , referring to intelligence and broader efforts to counter lashkar it s a massive failure and some small successes zarrar shah was a digitally savvy operative , a man with a bushy beard , a pronounced limp , strong ties to pakistani intelligence and an intense hatred for india , according to western and indian officials and court files the spy agencies of britain , the united states and india considered him the technology and communications chief for lashkar , a group dedicated to attacking india his fascination with jihad established him as something of a pioneer for a generation of islamic extremists who use the internet as a weapon according to indian court records and interviews with intelligence officials , mr shah was in his late 20s when he became the emir , or chief , of the lashkar media unit because of his role , mr shah , together with another young lashkar chief named sajid mir , became an intelligence target for the british , indians and americans lashkaretaiba , which translates as the army of the pure , grew rapidly in the 1990s thanks to a powerful patron the interservices intelligence directorate \( isi \) , the pakistani spy agency that the cia has worked with uneasily for years lashkar conducted a proxy war for pakistan in return for arms , funds , intelligence , and training in combat tactics and communications technology initially , lashkar s focus was india and kashmir , the mountainous region claimed by both india and pakistan but lashkar became increasingly interested in the west a qaeda figure involved in the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks on the world trade center was arrested in a lashkar safe house in 2002 investigators dismantled a lashkar network as it plotted a bombing in australia in 2003 while recruiting , buying equipment and raising funds in north america and europe in 2007 , a french court convicted in absentia the ringleader , mr mir he remained at large in pakistan under isi protection , investigators say lashkar s alliance with the isi came under strain as some of the militants pushed for a qaedastyle war on the west as a result , some isi officers and terror chiefs decided that a spectacular strike was needed to restore lashkar s cohesion and burnish its image , according to interviews and court files the plan called for a commandostyle assault in india that could also hit americans , britons and jews there the target was the centerpiece of indian prosperity mumbai lashkar s chiefs developed a plot that would dwarf previous operations the lead conspirators were alleged to be mr mir and mr lakhvi , according to interviews and indian court files , with mr shah acting as a technical wingman , running the communications and setting up the hardware in early 2008 , indian and western counterterrorism agencies began to pick up chatter about a potential attack on mumbai indian spy agencies and police forces gathered periodic leads from their own sources about a lashkar threat to the city starting in the spring , cia warnings singled out the iconic taj mahal palace hotel and other sites frequented by westerners , according to american and indian officials those warnings came from electronic and human sources , not from tracking mr shah , other officials said the us intelligence community on multiple occasions between june and november 2008 warned the indian government about lashkar threats in mumbai , said brian hale , a spokesman for the director of the office of national intelligence the information identified several potential targets in the city , but we did not have specific information about the timing or the method of attack united states spy agencies also alerted their british counterparts , according to a senior american intelligence official it is unclear if the warnings led to the targeting of mr shah s communications , but by the fall of 2008 , the british had found a way to monitor lashkar s digital networks so had the indians but until the attacks , one indian official said , there was no communication between the two countries on the matter western spy agencies routinely share significant or actionable intelligence involving threats with allies , but sometimes do not pass on less important information even friendly agencies are typically reluctant to disclose their sources of intelligence britain and india , while cooperative , were not nearly as close as the united states and britain and india is not included in the tightest intelligencesharing circles of international , eavesdropping agencies that the two countries anchor intelligence officials say that terror plots are often discernible only in hindsight , when a pattern suddenly emerges from what had been just bits of information whatever the reason , no one fully grasped the developing mumbai conspiracy they either were n't looking or did n't understand what it all meant , said one former american official who had access to the intelligence and would speak only on the condition of anonymity there was a lot more noise than signal there usually is not long after the british gained access to his communications , mr shah contacted a new jersey company , posing online as an indian reseller of telephone services named kharak singh , purporting to be based in mumbai his indian persona started haggling over the price of a voiceoverinternet phone service also known as voip that had been chosen because it would make calls between pakistan and the terrorists in mumbai appear as if they were originating in austria and new jersey its not first time in my life i am perchasing in this voip business , mr shah wrote in shaky english , to an official with the new jerseybased company when he thought the asking price was too high , the gchq documents show i am using these services from 2 years mr shah had begun researching the voip systems , online security , and ways to hide his communications as early as midseptember , according to the documents as he made his plan , he searched on his laptop for weak communication security in europe , spent time on a site designed to conceal browsing history , and searched google news for indian american naval exercises presumably so the seagoing attackers would not blunder into an overwhelming force , the only terrorist who would survive the mumbai attacks , watched mr shah display some of his technical prowess in midseptember , mr shah and fellow plotters used google earth and other material to show mr kasab and nine other young pakistani terrorists their targets in mumbai , according to court testimony the session , which took place in a huge media room in a remote camp on the border with kashmir , was part of an effort to chart the terrorists' route across the arabian sea , to a water landing on the edge of mumbai , then through the chaotic streets videos , maps and reconnaissance reports had been supplied to mr mir by mr headley , the pakistaniamerican who scouted targets the gunmen were shown all this data from the reconnaissance , said deven bharti , a top mumbai police official who investigated the attacks , adding that the terrorists were trained to use google earth and global positioning equipment on their own kasab was trained to locate everything in mumbai before he went if mr shah made any attempt to hide his malevolent intentions , he did not have much success at it although his frenetic computer activity was often sprawling , he repeatedly displayed some key interests smallscale warfare , secret communications , tourist and military locations in india , extremist ideology and mumbai he searched for sun tzu s art of war , previous terror strikes in india and weather forecasts in the arabian sea , typed 4 star hotel in delhi and taj hotel , and visited to pore over sites in and around mumbai , the documents show still , the sheer scale of his ambition might have served as a smokescreen for his focus on the city for example , he also showed interest in kashmir , the indian punjab , new delhi , afghanistan and the united states army in germany and canada he constantly flipped back and forth among internet porn and entertainment sites while he was carrying out his work he appeared to be fascinated with the actor robert de niro , called up at least one article on the singer taylor swift , and looked at funny cat videos he visited , a conspiracy theory website , and conducted a search on barak obama family muslim in late september and again in october , lashkar botched attempts to send the attackers to mumbai by sea during that period , at least two of the cia warnings were delivered , according to american and indian officials an alert in midseptember mentioned the taj hotel among a halfdozen potential targets , causing the facility to temporarily beef up security another on nov 18 reported the location of a pakistani vessel linked to a lashkar threat against the southern coastal area of mumbai , where the attack would occur eventually mr shah did set up the voip service through the new jersey company , ensuring that many of his calls to the terrorists would bear the area code 201 , concealing their actual origin but in november , the company s owner wrote to the fictitious indian reseller , mr singh , complaining that no traffic was running on the digital phone network mr shah s reply was ominous , according to indian law enforcement officials , who obtained evidence from the company s communications records with fbi assistance after the attack dear sir , mr shah replied , i will send trafic by the end of this month by nov 24 , mr shah had moved to the karachi suburbs , where he set up an electronic control room with the help of an indian militant named abu jundal , according to his later confession to the indian authorities it was from this room that mr mir , mr shah and others would issue minutebyminute instructions to the assault team once the attacks began on nov 25 , abu jundal tested the voip software on four laptops spread out on four small tables facing a pair of televisions as the plotters , including mr mir , mr shah and mr lakhvi , waited for the killings to begin in a plan to pin the blame on indians , mr shah typed a statement of responsibility for the attack from the hyderabad deccan mujahadeen a fake indian organization early on nov 26 , mr shah showed more of his hand he emailed a draft of the phony claim to an underling with orders to send it to the news media later , according to american and indian counterterrorism officials before the attacks started that evening , the documents show , mr shah pulled up google images of the oberoi hotel and conducted wikimapia searches for the taj and the chabad house , the jewish hostel run by an american rabbi from brooklyn who would die in the strike along with his pregnant wife mr shah opened the hostel s website he began googling news coverage of mumbai just before the attacks began an intercept shows what mr shah was reading , on the news website ndtv , as the killings proceeded mumbai , the city which never sleeps , was brought to its knees on wednesday night as it came under an unprecedented multiple terror attack , the article said even as heavily armed police stormed into taj hotel , just opposite the gateway of india where suspected terrorists were still holed up , bloodsoaked guests could be seen carried out into the waiting ambulances in the united states , nov 26 was the wednesday before thanksgiving a long presidential election fight was over , and many officials in washington had already drifted away for their long weekend anish goel , director for south asia at the national security council in the white house , left around 6 am for the eighthour drive to his parents' house in ohio by the time he arrived , his blackberry was filled with emails about the attacks the pakistani terrorists had come ashore in an inflatable speedboat in a fishermen s slum in south mumbai about 9 pm local time they fanned out in pairs and struck five targets with bombs and ak47s the taj , the oberoi hotel , the leopold cafe , chabad house , and the city s largest train station the killing was indiscriminate , merciless , and seemingly unstoppable over three horrific days in raw , contemporaneous notes by analysts , the eavesdroppers seem to be making a hasty effort to understand the clues from the days and weeks before analysis of zarrar shah s viewing habits and other data yielded several locations in mumbai well before the attacks occurred and showed operations planning for initial entry points into the taj hotel , the nsa document said that viewing history also revealed a longer list of what might have been future targets mk narayanan , india s national security adviser at the time , appeared to be concerned about that data from mr shah in discussions with american officials shortly after the attacks , according to the wikileaks archive of american diplomatic cables a top secret gchq document described the capture of information on targets that mr shah had identified using google earth the analysts seemed impressed by the intelligence haul unprecedented realtime active access in place ! one gchq document noted another agency document said the work to piece the data together was briefed at highest levels nationally and internationally , including the us national security adviser as early reports of many casualties came in , mr goel said the focus in washington shifted to a question already preoccupying the white house is this going to lead to a war between pakistan and india \? american officials who conducted periodic simulations of how a nuclear conflict could be triggered often began with a terror attack like this one on nov 30 , mr goel was back at his office , reading a stack of intelligence reports that had accumulated on his desk and reviewing classified electronic messages on a secure terminal amid the crisis , mr goel , now a senior south asia fellow at the new america foundation , paid little attention to the sources of the intelligence and said that he still knew little about specific operations but two things stood out , he said the main conspirators in pakistan had already been identified and the quality and rapid pacing of the intelligence reports made it clear that electronic espionage was primarily responsible for the information during the attacks , it was extraordinarily helpful , mr goel said of the surveillance but until then , the united states did not know of the british and indian spying on mr shah s communications while i cannot comment on the authenticity of any alleged classified documents , nsa had no knowledge of any access to a lead plotter s computer before the attacks in mumbai in november 2008 , said mr hale , the spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence as nsa and gchq analysts worked around the clock after the attacks , the flow of intelligence enabled washington , london and new delhi to exert pressure on pakistan to round up suspects and crack down on lashkar , despite its alliance with the isi , according to officials involved in the stacks of intelligence reports , one name did not appear , mr goel clearly recalls none of the intelligence streams from the united states , britain or india had yet identified him as a conspirator mr headley s manysided life three wives , drugsmuggling convictions and a past as an informant for the united states drug enforcement administration would eventually collapse but for now , he was a free man , watching the slaughter on television in lahore , pakistan , according to his later court testimony at the time , he was with faiza outalha , his moroccan wife , having reconciled with her after moving his pakistani wife and four children to chicago mr headley s unguarded emails reflected euphoria about lashkar s success an exchange with his wife in chicago continued a long string of incriminating electronic communications by mr headley written in a transparent code , according to investigators and case files i watched the movie the whole day , she wrote , congratulating him on his graduation about a week later , mr headley hinted at his inside information in an email to fellow alumni of a pakistani military school writing about the young terrorists who carried out the mayhem in mumbai , he said yes they were only 10 kids , guaranteed i hear 2 were married with a daughter each under 3 years old his subsequent emails contained several dozen news media photos of the mumbai siege almost immediately , mr headley began pursuing a new plot with lashkar against a danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the prophet muhammad he went to denmark in january and cased the newspaper , meeting and exchanging emails with its advertising staff , according to his later testimony and court records he sent messages to his fellow conspirators and emailed himself a reconnaissance checklist of sorts , with terms like countersurveillance , security \( armed \? \) and king s square the site of the newspaper those emails capped a series of missed signals involving mr headley the fbi conducted at least four inquiries into allegations about his extremist activity between 2001 and 2008 ms outalha had visited the united states embassy in islamabad three times between december 2007 and april 2008 , according to interviews and court documents , claiming that he was a terrorist carrying out missions in india mr headley also exchanged highly suspicious emails with his lashkar and isi handlers before and after the mumbai attacks , according to court records and american counterterrorism officials the nsa collected some of his emails , but did not realize he was involved in terrorist plotting until he became the target of an fbi investigation , officials said that inquiry began in july 2009 when a british tip landed on the desk of a rookie fbi counterterrorism agent in chicago someone named david at a chicago pay phone had called two suspects under surveillance in britain , planning to visit he had contacted the britons for help with the plot , according to testimony customs and border protection used his flight itinerary to identify him while en route , and after further investigation , the fbi arrested him at chicago o'hare airport that october , as he was preparing to fly to pakistan for his role in the mumbai attacks , he pleaded guilty to 12 counts and was in prison after disclosures last year of widespread nsa surveillance , american officials claimed that bulk collection of electronic communications led to mr headley s eventual arrest but a government oversight panel rejected claims giving credit to the nsa s program to collect americans' domestic phone call records case files and interviews with law enforcement officials show that the nsa played only a support role in the fbi investigation that finally identified mr headley as a terrorist and disrupted the danish plot the sole surviving attacker of the mumbai attack , mr kasab , was after a trial although pakistan denies any role in the attacks , it has failed to charge an isi officer and mr mir , who were indicted by american prosecutors though mr shah and other lashkar chiefs had been arrested , their trial remains stalled six years after the attack mr menon , the former indian foreign secretary , said that a lesson that emerged from the tragedy in mumbai was that computer traffic only tells you so much it s only a thin slice the key is the analysis , he said , and we did n't have it
kona , hawaii from the moment the bill to ban on the island of hawaii was introduced in may 2013 , it garnered more vocal support than any the county council here had ever considered , even the perennially popular bids to decriminalize marijuana public hearings were dominated by recitations of the ills often attributed to genetically modified organisms , or gmos cancer in rats , a rise in childhood allergies , outofcontrol superweeds , genetic contamination , overuse of , the disappearance of butterflies and bees like some others on the ninemember council , greggor ilagan was not even sure at the outset of the debate exactly what genetically modified organisms were living things whose dna has been altered , often with the addition of a gene from a distant species , to produce a desired trait but he could see why almost all of his colleagues had been persuaded of the virtue of turning the island into what the bill s proponents called a gmofree oasis you just type gmo' and everything you see is negative , he told his staff opposing the ban also seemed likely to ruin anyone s reelection prospects yet doubts nagged at the councilman , who was serving his first twoyear term the island s papaya farmers said that an engineered variety had saved their fruit from a devastating disease a study reporting that caused tumors in rats , mentioned often by the ban s supporters , turned out to have been thoroughly debunked and university of hawaii biologists urged the council to consider the , which holds that existing genetically engineered crops are no riskier than others , and have provided some tangible benefits are we going to just ignore them \? mr ilagan wondered urged on by margaret wille , the ban s sponsor , who spoke passionately of the need to act before it s too late , the council declined to form a task force to look into such questions before its november vote but mr ilagan , 27 , sought answers on his own in the process , he found himself , like so many public and business leaders worldwide , wrestling with a subject in which popular beliefs often do not reflect scientific evidence at stake is how to grow healthful food most efficiently , at a time when a warming world and a growing population make that goal all the more urgent scientists , who have come to rely on liberals in political battles over stemcell research , climate change and the teaching of evolution , have been dismayed to find themselves some compare the hostility to gmos to the rejection of climatechange science , except with liberal opponents instead of conservative ones these are my people , they 're lefties , i'm with them on almost everything , said michael shintaku , a plant pathologist at the university of hawaii at hilo , who testified several times against the bill it hurts but , supporters of the ban warned , scientists had not always correctly assessed the health and environmental risks of new technology remember ddt \? one proponent demanded ms wille s bill would ban the cultivation of any genetically engineered crop on the island , with the exception of the two already grown there corn recently planted by an island dairy to feed its cows , and papaya field tests to study new gmo crops would also be prohibited penalties would be 1 , 000 per day like threequarters of the voters on hawaii island , known as the big island , mr ilagan supported president obama in the 2012 election when he took office himself a month later , after six years in the air national guard , he planned to focus on squatters , crime prevention and the inauguration of a bus line in his district on the island s eastern rim he had also promised himself that he would take a stance on all topics , never registering a kanalua vote the hawaiian term for with reservation but with the gmo bill , he often despaired of assembling the information he needed to definitively decide every time he answered one question , it seemed , new ones arose popular opinion masqueraded convincingly as science , and the science itself was hard to grasp people who spoke as experts lacked credentials , and gmo critics discounted those with credentials as being pawns of biotechnology companies it takes so much time to find out what s true , he complained so many emails arrived in support of the ban that , as a matter of environmental responsibility , the council clerks suspended the custom of printing them out for each council member but mr ilagan had only to consult his inbox to be reminded of the prevailing opinion do the right thing , one chicago woman wrote , or no one will want to take a toxic tour of your poisoned paradise margaret wille , 66 , had the island s best interests at heart when she proposed the ban , mr ilagan knew she majored in cultural anthropology at bennington college in vermont and practiced public advocacy law in maine before moving a decade ago to the island , where her brothers once owned a health food store and her bill , like much antigmo action , was inspired by distrust of the seedproducing biotechnology companies , which had backed a state measure to prevent local governments from regulating their activity that bill , which passed the state senate but stalled in the house , appeared largely aimed at other hawaiian islands , which were used by companies like monsanto , syngenta and dow as a nursery for seeds on , for instance , activists had been talking about how to limit the companies' pesticide use the companies had no corporate presence here on the big island , which lacks the large parcels of land they preferred still , ms wille rally last spring , if the island allowed farmers to grow genetically modified crops , the companies could gain a foothold this represents nothing less than a takeover of our island , she told the crowd there s a saying , if you control the seed , you control the food if you control the food , you control the people' ms wille , chairwoman of the council s agriculture committee , warned her colleagues that what mattered was not the amount of food produced , but its quality and the sustainability of how it was grown my focus is on protecting our soil and the farms and properties that are not gmo , she said , noting also that there was a marketing opportunity for nongmo products such sentiments echoed well beyond hawaii , as mr ilagan s early research confirmed college students , ecoconscious shoppers and talk show celebrities like , and warned against consuming food made with genetically modified ingredients mr maher s audience , in turn , recently who defended genetic modification as merely an extension of traditional breeding new applications of the technology , so far used mostly on corn , soybeans , cotton , canola and sugar beets to make them more resistant to weeds and pests , have drawn increased scrutiny a recent organic consumers association bulletin , for instance , pictures the first genetically modified animal to be submitted for regulatory approval \( a fastergrowing salmon \) jumping from a river to attack a bear , with the caption no frankenfish ! in a 2013 new york times poll , threequarters of americans surveyed expressed concern about gmos in their food , with most of those worried about health risks as ms wille s bill was debated here throughout 2013 , activists elsewhere collected 354 , 000 signatures for a asserting that gmos endanger public health in the philippines , protesters , citing safety concerns , genetically engineered to address deficiency among the world s poor a new children s book turned into a crusader against genetic modification these fruits and vegetables are not natural , she declares and bills were proposed in some 20 states to require gmo labels on foods with ingredients made from genetically engineered crops \( about threequarters of processed foods now have such ingredients , mostly corn syrup , corn oil and soy meal and sugar \) the legislation is , which sees such labeling as giving it a competitive advantage it has also become a rallying cry among activists who want to change the industrial food system rachel maddow declared the narrow failure of ballot initiatives to require gmo labeling in california and washington a big loss for liberal politics whole foods has pledged that by 2018 it will replace some foods containing genetically modified ingredients and label others signs in trader joe s proclaim , no gmos sold here general mills announced last week that it would stop using genetically modified ingredients in its cheerios but the has rankled many scientists , who argue that opponents of gmos have distorted the risks associated with them and underplayed the risks of failing to try to use the technology to improve how food is grown wading into a debate that has more typically pitted activists against industry , some have argued that opposition from even small pockets of an american elite influences investment in research and the deployment of genetically modified crops , particularly in the developing world , where hunger raises the stakes just as many on the political right discount the broad scientific consensus that human activities contribute to global warming , many progressive advocacy groups disregard , reject or ignore the decades of scientific studies demonstrating the safety and widereaching benefits of genetically engineered crops , pamela ronald , a professor of plant pathology at the university of california , davis , wrote on the blog of the nonprofit  and other scientists , including two nobel prize winners , wrote an opinion article for the journal science last fall titled  as he traversed the island and the internet , mr ilagan agreed with constituents that there was good reason to suspect that companies like monsanto would place profit above public safety he , too , wished for more healthful food to be grown more sustainably but even a national ban on such crops , it seemed to him , would do little to solve the problems of an industrial food system that existed long before their invention nor was it likely to diminish the market power of the big ag companies , which also dominate sales of seeds that are not genetically modified , and the pesticides used on both the arguments for rejecting them , he concluded , ultimately relied on the premise that they are unsafe making up his mind about that alone would prove difficult enough the papaya farmers appeared , pacing restlessly , outside mr ilagan s office shortly after ms wille introduced the proposal for a gmo ban in may there were only around 200 of them on an island with a population of about 185 , 000 , but many lived in his district they wanted to be sure he understood that genetically modified papayas , the only commercially grown gmo fruit in the united states , account for threequarters of the 30 million pounds harvested annually here they 're treating us like we 're criminals , said ross sibucao , the head of the growers' association another council member favored razing every genetically modified papaya tree on the island but under ms wille s bill , the modified papaya , known as the rainbow , was grandfathered in , as long as farmers registered with the county and paid a 100 annual fee you 're exempted , mr ilagan reassured mr sibucao even so , mr sibucao replied , the bill would stigmatize any genetically modified food , making the rainbow harder to sell many of the island s papaya farmers , descendants of immigrants who came to work on sugar plantations , have links to the philippines , as does mr ilagan , who immigrated from there as a child as the plantations faded in the 1980s , some began growing papayas but after an outbreak of in the mid'90s , endowed with a gene from the virus itself that effectively gave it immunity , had saved the crop , they told him if mr ilagan worried about big biotechnology companies , the farmers told him , the rainbow should reassure him developed primarily by scientists at academic institutions , it was a model for how the technology could benefit small farmers its lead developer , the hawaiianborn dennis gonsalves , was , along with others on the team , awarded the 2002 humboldt prize for the most significant contribution to united states agriculture in five years japanese as well as american regulators had approved the papaya and because the virus was spread by insects , which growers had sought to control with pesticide sprays , the rainbow had reduced the use of chemicals mr ilagan took their point if we as a body pass this , he said , thinking aloud at the second public hearing in july , it shows we think all gmos are wrong instructed by the chairman not to applaud , the residents who packed the county council chamber in kona on july 3 erupted in , signaled by a collective waving of hands and wiggling of fingers a few , like richard ha , an island farmer who hoped that the diseases afflicting his bananas and tomatoes might be solved with a genetic modification , were there to testify against the ban ranchers also were opposed they wanted the option to grow the genetically modified corn and soybeans for cattle feed that are common elsewhere but a vast majority were there in support some were members of , a mix of food activists and entrepreneurs , who argued that the organisms were bad for human health , the island s ecosystem and ecoconscious business others , veterans of the campaign for a partial ban already in place here , reminded the council of the precedents for ms wille s bill in 2008 , organic kona coffee farmers successfully lobbied for a ban on any cultivation of genetically modified coffee the presence of a gmo crop , they argued , would hurt their reputation and their ability to charge a premium at the same time , the county had banned the cultivation of genetically engineered taro , a root vegetable cultivated for centuries in hawaii in the three minutes allotted to each speaker at the july hearing , some told personal tales of all manner of illness , including children s allergies , cured after going on a nongmo diet one woman took the microphone on behalf of mother earth and all sentient beings nomi carmona encouraged council members to visit the website of her group , , where analyses of monsanto s campaign contributions are intermingled with pictures of bikiniclad women many of the most impassioned speakers came from mr ilagan s district of puna , known for its antiestablishment spirit these chemical companies think they 're going to win , one woman said hell , no , they 're never going to win here organic farmers worried that their crops would be contaminated also made an impression on the councilman , though he felt that the actress roseanne barr , who owns an organic macadamia nut farm here , could have been kinder to the papaya farmers in the room everybody here is very giving , she had told them they will bend over backwards to help you burn those papayas and grow something decent more striking to mr ilagan was the warning of derek brewer , 29 , an army veteran who served in iraq and afghanistan before coming to hawaii to help found an we do n't fully understand , mr brewer said , his dark hair tied back in a ponytail once you change something like this , there is no taking it back what really stuck with mr ilagan were the descriptions of tumorous rats reading testimony submitted before the hearing , he had blanched at grotesque pictures of the animals fed monsanto s corn , modified with a gene from bacteria to tolerate an herbicide according to the french researcher who performed the study , they developed more tumors and died earlier than those in the control group are we all \? mr ilagan wondered the next week , when his legislative assistant alerted him that the rat study encountered nearuniversal scorn from scientists after its release in autumn 2012 , doubt about much of what mr ilagan had heard began to prick at his mind come to find out , the kind of rats they used would get tumors anyway , he told his staff and the sample size was too small for any conclusive results sensitive to the accusation that her bill was antiscience , ms wille had circulated material to support it but in almost every case , mr ilagan and his staff found evidence that seemed to undermine the claims a report , in an obscure russian journal , after three generations as a result of a diet of genetically modified soybeans had been contradicted by many other studies and deemed bogus by mainstream scientists mr ilagan discounted the correlations between the and the consumption of gmos , cited by ms wille and others , after reading of the common mistake of confusing correlation for causation \( one graph , illustrating the weakness of conclusions based on correlation , charted the l \) butterflies were disappearing , but mr ilagan learned that it was not a toxin produced by modified plants that harmed them , as he had thought instead , the herbicide used in conjunction with some genetically modified crops \( as well as some that were not \) meant the on most midwestern farms he heard many times that there were no independent studies of the safety of genetically modified organisms but biofortified , which received no funding from industry , , including a 2010 comprehensive review sponsored by the european union , that found no scientific evidence associating gmos with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms it echoed similar statements by the world health organization , the national academy of sciences , the royal society of medicine and the american association for the advancement of science a blog post on the website of npr , a news source mr ilagan trusted , cataloged what it called no 1 was a thing he had long believed seeds from gmos are sterile one of the more alarming effects of gmos that ms wille had cited was suicides among farmers in india , purportedly driven into debt by the high cost of patented , genetically modified cotton seeds biotechnology companies , she said , come in and give it away cheap , and then raise prices monsanto s cotton , engineered with a gene from bacteria to ward off certain insects , had pushed 270 , 000 farmers to suicide since the company started selling it in india in 2002 , the activist vandana shiva said in a honolulu speech ms wille attended but in nature , a leading academic journal , mr ilagan found an with the subhead gm cotton has driven farmers to suicide false according to the nature article , peerreviewed research in 2011 found that suicides among farmers were no more numerous after the new seeds were introduced than before and a 2012 study found that farmers' profits rose because of reduced losses from pest attacks there s farmers committing suicide because of the whole debt issue , but it s not because of the gmo issue , mr ilagan said he concluded in midaugust still , it was hard not to be spooked by material emailed by constituents and circulated on facebook images of and of , warnings of by parents serving genetically modified food the specter of genetic contamination still haunted him and his mother , who had always served papaya at home , had stopped because of her new concerns about the rainbow variety the scientists at the national agriculture research center here were not accustomed to local council representatives dropping by unannounced but one day in august , mr ilagan recalled , when he turned up in search of someone who could answer questions about genetic contamination , he found a molecular biologist willing to help it s kind of a loaded term , the councilman remembered the scientist , jon suzuki , saying what they 're talking about is crosspollination , which is something that happens all the time within species the councilman knew little about how food was grown he enlisted in the air national guard immediately after high school and abandoned his first semester of community college classes when he decided to run for the council seat dr suzuki gave him a tutorial on plant reproduction , mr ilagan recalled , explaining that with the wind , insects and animals spreading pollen and seeds , crosspollination can never be entirely avoided but , mr ilagan learned , by staggering planting times and ensuring a reasonable distance between crops , it is usually possible to avoid largescale mingling also , plants have different fertilization methods the rainbow papaya , for instance , was largely selffertilizing if it is planted about 12 feet away from other varieties , the chance of crosspollination is exceedingly low but what about the papaya contaminating mr ilagan recalls correcting himself crosspollinating with a pineapple \? this was the part he had trouble explaining to himself was the virus gene from the papaya also in ms barr s macadamia nuts and the organic coffee farmer s beans \? dr suzuki paused with plants of different species it s kind of like how you do n't cross a cat with a dog and expect to have offspring , he said duh ! exclaimed mr ilagan i should have realized that in the following weeks , mr ilagan sometimes called dr suzuki with his question du jour for instance , do weeds near genetically modified crops turn into because of a rogue gene \? the scientist , he recalled , helped him understand that superweeds were weeds that had evolved resistance to a widely used herbicide most likely faster than they would have if farmers had not used it so much on crops genetically engineered to tolerate it biotechnology firms were already selling seeds that tolerated other , less benign herbicides , mr ilagan learned but that was a different problem from the specter conjured by a woman at one of the hearings , who said that gmos are crosspollinating with weeds that now ca n't be controlled asked about the danger of moving genes among species where they had not originated , dr suzuki explained that for millenniums , humans had bred crops of the same species to produce desired traits but with the advent of genetic engineering , it became possible to borrow a feature from elsewhere on the tree of life an example mr ilagan later learned about was the rice being tested in the philippines modified with genes from bacteria and corn , , the deficiency of which is a scourge of the world s poor that did not mean genetically engineered food could never cause harm but the risks of such crops could be reliably tested , and they had so far proved safe with scientists , we never say anything is 100 percent certain one way or another , dr suzuki said we weigh conclusions on accumulated knowledge or evidence but often this is not satisfactory for some on oct 1 , mr ilagan voted to block the bill from moving out of committee , shortly after a day of what ms wille and brenda ford , another council member who was a proponent of the ban , had described as expert testimony at the hearing on sept 23 , he had grown increasingly uneasy as his fellow council members declined to call several university of hawaii scientists who had flown from oahu , instead allotting 45 minutes to , a selfstyled expert on gmos with no scientific credentials one university of hawaii at manoa biologist , richard manshardt , responded to a question from ms ford about the effect on honeybees of corn engineered to resist pests none , he said , because the protein it produced affected only certain insect groups , and was not toxic to bees i do n't agree with the professor , ms ford told her colleagues many university of hawaii scientists had already registered their opposition to the bill , in written and oral testimony and letters in the local papers if the ban passed , local farmers could not take advantage of projects underway at the university and elsewhere , they noted , including droughttolerant crops and higheryield pineapple plants genetic engineering is a precise technique that itself is not harmful , the dean of the school s college of tropical agriculture and human resources , maria gallo , wrote in one oped but ms wille had largely dismissed the opinions of university researchers , citing monsanto contributions to the university in 2012 , she noted , the company made a onetime donation of 600 , 000 for student scholarships at the college of tropical agriculture and human resources , an amount that the college said represented about 1 percent of its annual budget that year it is sad that our state has allowed our university departments of agriculture to become largely dependent upon funding grants from the multinational chemical corporations , ms wille told reporters , suggesting that the university s professors were largely a mouthpiece for the gmo biotech industry she did , however , rely on the opinion of a specialist in organic agriculture practices at the university , hector valenzuela , who supported the bill mr smith , known for , a movie he produced based on his book of the same title that had been shown at one of the island s march against monsanto events , appeared at the hearing by skype from arizona he praised the council for stepping in where he believes that federal regulatory agencies have failed , and suggested that the rainbow papaya could harm people because of a protein produced by the viral gene added to it , adding that no human or animal feeding studies had ever been conducted on the fruit mr ilagan was genuinely curious to hear the author s take on his own latest realization each genetically modified organism was different , and came with its own set of tradeoffs i do n't see a blanket ban , he told his staff that week it seems like it should be a casebycase thing aloha , mr smith , mr ilagan said when he had his turn or is it dr smith \? no , jeffrey s fine , mr smith said over skype in your world , mr ilagan asked , is there any room for any gmo \? mr smith replied that there was not in the afternoon , dr gonsalves , who led the development of the rainbow papaya , was given time to respond to mr smith s allegations he laid to rest a lingering question about papaya safety that had troubled mr ilagan he explained that any papaya infected by the ringspot virus contains the protein mr smith had mentioned as potentially dangerous in the genetically modified rainbow moreover , plant viruses do not infect people everyone was eating virusinfected papaya in the 1990s , dr gonsalves said and now you want to do feeding studies \? with one member absent , only one other council member joined mr ilagan in opposing the bill the council deferred a decision on creating a task force to discuss the implications of banning genetically modified organisms ms wille assured her colleagues that , upon the bill s passage , she would support the formation of such a group but it was better not to delay , she said i want to draw a line in the sand until we can take a closer look the response to mr ilagan s vote was swift and unambiguous he was mocked on facebook and pilloried in letters from constituents you have been influenced by the contrived arguments from the progmo interests , one letter read many of my fellow puna residents will seriously consider more progressive candidates for the next council term greggor , what do you think you 're doing \? his campaign manager , kareen haskin , 70 , a close family friend , asked him the main thing i told people was you would listen to them he told her that though a vocal minority supported the ban , many other constituents knew little about the complex issue i have to do what s right for them , too he told ms haskin what he had learned about health and environmental aspects of genetic engineering but as he had found often happened in conversations about gmos , the subject quickly shifted we do n't want corporations to own all the seeds , she said mr ilagan was as opposed as ms haskin was to big businesses controlling a market , in part by using patents that prohibit farmers from replanting or selling their seeds but banning crops because they were made with genetic engineering would not change the patent laws , he told her mr ilagan had been alarmed by testimony from farmers who said they could be sued by monsanto and other patentholders when patented seeds ended up in their fields by accident but he found there was no evidence that monsanto had ever  i'm still trying to voice this out , he said , but to me it just seems symbolic like doing something that seems good , but not really achieving what you want to achieve ms haskin took his hand you have to vote for this bill , she pleaded what about all the pesticides being sprayed on our food \? the conversation , he noticed , had turned again the council meeting on oct 15 started with public testimony that lasted more than seven hours again , mr ilagan found himself touched by the emotion of the crowd a mother brought her 8yearold to testify mr brewer , the ecohostel owner , was in the audience with his wife , who is deaf , signing so she could follow the debate invoking the hawaiian word for land , several speakers not necessarily of hawaiian descent begged for our aina to be preserved our island can be the uncontaminated seedbed for the world , one said those in favor of the bill outnumbered those opposed by more than five to one lukas kambic , a biology major at the university of hawaii at hilo , sought to use his own experience to counter the anecdotes others voiced that night my mom ate organic food exclusively and did yoga all the time , and she died of a brain aneurysm , mr kambic said according to the logic of people here , she was killed by organic food and yoga the room was silent knowing that the final vote on the ban was yet to come , mr ilagan voted no after the hearing then nearly 1 , 000 people quickly signed a petition demanding that he change his vote at the final hearing , scheduled for nov 18 for the first time in his career as councilman , he began to consider voting kanalua yes , with reservation in early november , he sought to escape with a friend to a condo in kona , only to be accosted at the pool by a voter demanding answers and on nov 14 , mr brewer , the veteran who runs an ecohostel , visited him in his office they discussed mr brewer s conviction that crosspollination by gmos would do unknown harm to the environment and detract from the island s image we need all the votes we can get to override a possible veto by the mayor , mr brewer said do you think you can vote for this bill , greggor \? mr ilagan still had questions of his own one scientist he had spoken to said the builtin pesticide in corn should not worry him , because many plants contain their own natural pesticides i still want to track that down , he told his staff what is an example of a natural pesticide \? maybe , he thought , he would join the longpromised task force , which would weigh the implications of banning gmos on the island and report back to the council the final hearing on the bill was not unlike the first superweeds were mentioned indian suicides contamination ms wille urged a vote for the ban to do otherwise , she said , would be to ignore the cries from round the world and on the mainland mr ilagan \? the council member leading the meeting asked when it came time for the final vote no , he replied the ban was approved , 6 to 3 the mayor signed the bill on dec 5 at the council meeting on dec 17 , ms wille s motion to create a committee to study the impact of banning genetically modified organisms on the island was not seconded , and she withdrew it stunned , mr ilagan briefly considered making his own motion to form a task force but he could see he would not have enough support it was time to move on a fastgrowing subdivision in his district needed a community park last week , mr ilagan turned his focus to drumming up support for the bond issue he would need from the county to plan and design it
late in the new world war i video game , a french soldier named mile is running into battle the scene is the real and awful , and it unfurls , as do so many other notable moments from the war in the game , like an interactive tapestry or a playable cartoon for grownups should mile follow the orders of an officer yelling at him to run to the right , he will charge across muddy hills past dying men through a shower of shells if he disobeys as many deserters in the war essentially did and runs left , he will meet the outstretched sword of a hardcharging french officer and die the history feels interactive valiant hearts is neither a clich d war video game about battlefield triumph nor one that has figured out perfectly how to make war games better it is , at least , a great and fascinating try beautifully drawn by the french development studio , it resembles a lovely animated film set mostly to sad classical music it depicts four years of war as experienced by mile and a few other playable characters an american volunteer named freddie mile s deported german soninlaw , karl a field nurse named anna and a dog these characters repeatedly cross paths at famous scenes of world war i and save one another s lives this frenchmade game is unconventional it is not a firstperson shooter showing history down the barrel of a gun or a strategy game sorting out the movement of tanks from the heavens there is a bit of artillery firing and tankdriving , but none of the playable characters ever fire rifles mostly , they run , hide or solve puzzles , sometimes on the battlefield , sometimes in bases or towns , all of them variations on real locations and scenes from the war all of it scrolls by at ground level in the muck of world war i , the montpellier team has found human drama about life and death amid the brutality of trenches filled with unexploded shells and across battlefields poisoned by gas , it has found a setting for a game about desperation and the smallest of victories valiant hearts has at least an aspiration to documentary , beginning with an explanation that its events are somewhat inspired by letters written from the western front welltimed , it was released near the 100th anniversary of the  video games are sometimes empowered by the need to give the player something to do , and sometimes they 're marred by it eschewing gun combat was a good idea in this case , letting players instead bear witness to the war and the emotions experienced by people in it the game s creators , nevertheless , flirt with derailment by leaning heavily on the trappings of the socalled adventure genre , a decadesold style heavy on puzzle solving and item fetching imagine a scene in a french barracks in which you are playing as a german who is trying to escape here is a door obstructed by a hungry dog there is a piece of meat the dog might enjoy the chef will relinquish the meat if you do him a favor the favor can be done only if you 've adopted a disguise the disguise can be won only if you 've fixed a shower , which can be done by solving a puzzle involving broken and bent pipes as the feeling of amusing gameness rises , the sense of authenticity fades valiant hearts' creators risked their worst disaster by briefly turning their adventure into an action game a tonal mistake pits the player s ensemble against a furious german officer whose extraordinary zeppelin and tank become the centerpieces of davidversusgoliath action moments boss battles , in gaming parlance , and entirely discordant with the desire to express war s more complex truths you can be thankful that the officer is gone long before the game ends , allowing the lives and deaths of more believable characters to hold more weight it s not that a war game ca n't be interactive in a meaningful or even subtle way it s just that it s hard , harder still with so little foundation valiant hearts is not just one of the very few world war i games , it is also one of the least violent war games , in terms of what the player does if players wo n't be asked to shoot a gun and maybe should n't be asked to fix a broken shower , what can they do \? valiant hearts has some promising answers dress a wound by tapping specific buttons on a game controller rapidly and rhythmically , a gameplay action that may not depict the sisyphean hope and despair of frontline medical care but at least produces an abstraction of the stress direct a dog into an enemy camp and be reminded that your enemy is much like you dig a trench duck from aircraft fire snap barbed wire avoid a mine hide behind a scarecrow in a field hear the quiet of the front at night and feel the fear when a flare heads skyward to erase the sheltering shadows liberate a prisoner spare a life rally friends follow orders , or doubt them consider running to the left try it and see if it feels true
los angeles is the nation s water archvillain , according to public perception , notorious for its usurpation of water hundreds of miles away to slake the thirst of its everexpanding population as a character in chinatown , the noirish 1974 film starring jack nicholson that churns through the city s water history , puts it , either you bring the water to la , or you bring la to the water recently , however , los angeles has reduced its reliance on outside sources of water it has become , of all things , a leader in sustainable water management , a pioneer in bigcity use of costeffective , environmentally beneficial water conservation , collection and reuse technologies some combination of these techniques is the most plausible path to survival for all the cities of the waterdepleted west one sign of los angeles s earnestness is its success in conservation the city now consumes less water than it did in 1970 , while its population has grown by more than a third , to 39 million people from 28 million two projects a nineacre watertreating wetland constructed in a former bus maintenance yard and a water management plan devised for a floodprone district of 80 , 000 people won awards this year from the institute for sustainable infrastructure the city itself won one of the first awards given by the us water alliance , in 2011 los angeles s shift occurred out of necessity , after legal decisions in the 1990s forced it to give up some of its imported water more and more cities now face water constraints in the west , where most climate scientists expect droughts to lengthen and deepen , the techniques being introduced in los angeles ought to be viewed not just as smart choices , but as requirements though most projects will start too late to address the severe drought now plaguing much of the west , they show how to cope with future ones together , these projects will treat polluted and even sewage water , capture rainwater , store water in aquifers , and use \( or reuse \) all of it , often while mimicking or supporting natural processes the area s water administrators who , until recently , thought of watersheds as merely rural concerns now recognize that even in los angeles , all living things are linked by their common water course and that its proper management is essential to the administrators' success in the last decade the tenets of sustainable watershed management have spread across the country the city of los angeles still imports 89 percent of its water , a proportion that underlines the severity of its water needs , but dozens of other cities \( including some eastern ones \) are embracing pieces of los angeles s water sustainability approach san francisco has become a leader in using recycled wastewater for nonpotable purposes like toilet flushing and gardening while reducing its per capita water use to 46 gallons a day , one of the lowest rates in the nation san antonio has developed a multifaceted conservation program that has cut the city s per capita water use by nearly half over the last two decades even philadelphia , which usually has ample water , committed itself in 2011 to a 12 billion green infrastructure program that uses storm water capture to prevent environmental degradation these efforts share the basic tenet that all the water in any watershed whether tap water , groundwater or toilet water must be considered part of a constantly circulating hydrological whole los angeles gets little rain , and what it does get occasionally arrives in the form of harsh , floodgenerating storms , like the ones last week after numerous destructive floods in the first third of the 20th century , the army corps of engineers and the city s public works department began building a floodcontrol infrastructure it was designed to move storm water quickly off city streets and into the pacific ocean all but seven miles of the 51milelong los angeles river was turned into an ugly concrete conduit that is usually empty flooding stopped , but at a cost as the region grew , agriculture gave way to urban development , and more and more land was covered with an impermeable layer of pavement and buildings this meant that even if a storm produced no more rainfall than one a decade earlier , it generated far more runoff as the water flowed over the city s hard surfaces , it collected more and more pollutants animal waste , car oil , toxic chemicals and metals and deposited them on the beaches and in the sea of course , los angeles was also importing huge amounts of water , drying out previously pristine areas far to the city s north the watersupply infrastructure imported water while the floodcontrol system exported it , and both processes ravaged the environment by the late 1980s , storm water quantities were getting so high that the floodcontrol channels could no longer contain them the authorities assumed their only alternative was to raise the cement walls still higher , which they did in the 1990s at a cost of 180 million meanwhile , two environmental campaigners , dorothy green of heal the bay and andy lipkis of treepeople , were telling anyone who would listen that the floodcontrol infrastructure should be reorganized to capture water , not cast it into the sea if storm water is harvested and directed into aquifers , they argued , floods can be prevented then the stored water can be pumped when needed , treated and consumed to prove his point , in 1998 mr lipkis s nonprofit retrofitted a house in south central los angeles , then staged a mock flood the house s roof was lined with gutters that fed rainwater into two 1 , 800gallon cisterns , and the lawns in the front yards and backyards were lowered six inches to form a wetland on the big day , local officials watched from beneath umbrellas as a 4 , 000gallon water truck dumped around 15 tons of water on the roof , yet none of it left the premises the property functioned instead as a miniature watershed , storing water for outdoor use or absorbing it and redirecting it to an aquifer below floodcontrol officials were so impressed that they dropped a 42 million proposal they had been considering for a storm drain in a highly floodprone section of the san fernando valley called sun valley and instead introduced a plan to test storm water capture there under the stewardship of the council for watershed health , a local nonprofit , six local government agencies responsible for water supply , water quality , floods and groundwater worked with academic researchers and the united states bureau of reclamation , the federal agency once known as the west s leading dam builder , to retrofit an entire sun valley city block the officials chose elmer avenue , a street so floodprone that routine storms turned it into a river completed in 2010 , the 27 million project enables residents to collect rainwater on their rooftops and divert it to rain barrels for later use water that overflows the rain barrels spills into spongelike rain gardens that replaced grass lawns further overflow seeps through permeable driveways or is conveyed by drain to a swale of rocks , soil , plants and mulch running the length of the sidewalks the street itself was excavated , filled with a sixfootdeep layer of gravel fed with rainwater through large perforated pipes and topped with pavement in an average rain year , that expanse should collect enough water for 80 houses , not just the 24 retrofitted ones as the water slowly drips into the aquifer below , it is cleansed of pollutants it collected on the street by encouraging natural processes that perform ecological services , the project simultaneously mitigates flooding , pollution and water scarcity production of water like that captured on elmer avenue costs 300 an acrefoot , while los angeles now pays 800 to 1 , 000 an acrefoot for imported water according to a study conducted by the pacific institute and the natural resources defense council , a fully developed stormwater capture system in greater los angeles could add 309 , 000 acrefeet per year to water supplies , more than half of los angeles city s annual current consumption of 587 , 000 acrefeet per year the demonstration projects persuaded los angeles officials last year to adopt an ambitious 20year plan that treats the los angeles basin as a single watershed , integrating water quality , water supply , flood control , wastewater , parks and habitat programs however , given the huge retrofit the plan requires , the program is still in its infancy it enjoys backing from the state , which as early as 2002 enacted legislation embracing integrated watershed management , and last month eric garcetti , the mayor of los angeles , underlined the city s shift to local water by issuing a directive to cut purchases of imported water by half within a decade even so , implementation is far from assured governance is probably the biggest obstacle to a sustainable water supply , mark pestrella , who heads flood control for the los angeles county public works department , told me a 2014 study by the geographers miriam a cope and stephanie s pincetl at the university of california , los angeles , found that more than 100 entities in los angeles county private utilities , nonprofit water companies , cities and an assortment of special districts conveyed water simply identifying and classifying them took the researchers more than a year some are tiny and will face pressure to consolidate and some agencies with a designated mission like sanitation or flood control may be impeded by the los angeles city charter from participating in multipurpose projects even if they can , they will undoubtedly find it hard to cede some of their authority to carry out multipurpose , multiagency projects so far most money for the projects has come from government grants and voterapproved bond measures , but new sources must be found for the vastly larger sums the projects require even so , what has already happened in los angeles is something rare a straightforward environmental victory environmentalists diagnosed a major problem and outlined its solution , and government officials eventually accepted their approach strangely , many , if not most , angelenos are oblivious to the region s pathbreaking role like everyone else , they think of los angeles as a water extorter , and do n't realize that its current path is the sincerest form of atonement
east rutherford , nj in the giants' last preseason game , the starting offense picked up one first down in two preseason games , eli manning has completed six passes for 43 yards the best receiver , victor cruz , does not have a catch no starting wide receiver has more than one reception last year s offense was 28th in the nfl , which is why the team revamped its system , changed coordinators and ushered in six new starters this is the newlook giants offense \? if not for a few stellar runs by the new back rashad jennings and the rookie backup andre williams , there would be almost no output at all from the firststringers of manning s six completions , none have been for more than 10 yards there have been only two preseason games , and the first was played after just nine practices so with the giants installing an overhauled offense under the new coordinator ben mcadoo , a little patience might be in order but as the team prepares for another preseason game on saturday , against the colts in indianapolis , the onus is on the starting offensive unit to show some level of competency a few good series and maybe a touchdown pass would help convince everyone on the sideline that the redesigned attack is not hopelessly foundering patience is indeed needed , but it is also true that on monday it will be three weeks until the season opener in detroit things never come as fast as you want them to come , coach tom coughlin said that just goes with the territory we are trying to put consistency together you struggle some , and you have to work your way through it that is why you play the preseason games mcadoo , based on his demeanor on the practice field , is a demanding , goaloriented coach but this week he has also preached a longterm view in his first meeting with reporters since training camp began , he was asked if he was concerned about the offense s progress in detroit , we need to be 100 percent ready to go , he answered we 're not there yet we 're making small strides you 'd like to say you 're taking two steps forward every day and one step back we have a plan on how we 're going to install the offense we 're going to continue installing and continue to review some things we 've done earlier mcadoo , like everyone else , can see what is not working obviously when you take a look at the first four drives from the last game , we did n't have much rhythm , he said we want to start faster but we 're not going to walk around with our heads down because of it turning manning from a quarterback who typically waits in the pocket for receivers to get open downfield into a west coaststyle quarterback who generally gets rid of the football more quickly is the continuing project the mostused word in giants training camp has been tempo but there s little pulse , pace or rhythm to six pass completions in two games in the most recent preseason game , against pittsburgh , the starting offensive unit also had to overcome two holding penalties and a quarterback sack but manning admitted that he would like to see the offense play on saturday with more unbridled confidence i think it s just good to open it up and play some football do n't try to be perfect , just hit plays , manning said for me , just try and get in a rhythm , moving the pocket , making plays , making good decisions and just try to be able to get some first downs and move the ball it 'd be nice to have some long series where you can get into a rhythm with this offense so that s the goal but the giants are still like kids in a new school their heads are swimming with the changes it s a lot of work there s still a lot going on , manning said , noting that the last parts of the playbook were being installed late this week there is still some thinking going on out there , still trying to understand some of the concepts that are going on there is also the notion that the giants are keeping much of their most ingenious offensive schemes under wraps since no team reveals too much of its scheming in the preseason we have n't shown the whole spectrum in any way , fullback henry hynoski said there are a myriad of things we can do we 're just getting started after saturday s visit to indianapolis , two preseason games remain against the jets and the new england patriots the starters will hardly play in the last one they will probably be sidelined by halftime saturday and will play slightly more than that against the jets next week that leaves the giants about four quarters to make the newly imported offensive system feel like their own extra points a subplot behind the starting offensive unit saturday will be the now clearly defined competition for the backup quarterback job throughout the preseason , it was obvious that the giants wanted ryan nassib , the 2013 fourthround draft pick , to win the job nassib was allowed to work with the secondstringers in most practices and the preseason games nassib has had some good moments , but the thirdstring quarterback curtis painter has completed each of the 10 passes he has thrown in the two preseason games and has made the offense seem more productive in those moments after thursday s practice , tom coughlin said that painter would be playing with the second team in saturday s preseason game with indianapolis it is a significant change left tackle will beatty , who broke his leg in the final regularseason game in 2013 , will see his first action saturday wide receiver odell beckham jr , the team s firstround draft pick this year , will not play as he continues to rehabilitate his strained hamstring
altay , china it has been a bad year for the bigtailed sheep the grass in the high mountain pastures here in northwest has been sparse , and the sheep have not eaten well they are scrawny that means the kazakh herders have suffered , too the drought has affected everyone , one herder , aijamal , 32 , who like many others here uses one name , said on a recent afternoon as she rode a horse to drive hundreds of sheep across a barren plateau we ca n't sell the sheep for the same price we did before sheep that wholesalers bought last year for 1 , 000 renminbi , about 160 , are commanding only 830 renminbi now , she said the price drop has come as a big blow to the nomadic kazakh herders whose families have for decades produced  and the season for fattening up the sheep is at an end across this remote area of pristine grasslands and alpine forests , along the southern slopes of the altai mountains , nomads are in the middle of their annual multiweek autumn migration , as they bring their families , yurts and livestock down from the high pastures to lower altitudes for the winter they are using horses , camels and flatbed trucks for transport , and horses and motorcycles to herd their animals clouds of dust rising from the steppes signal nomads on the move this lifestyle has continued for centuries here , north of the xinjiang region s desolate dzungarian basin and near china s borders with mongolia , kazakhstan and russia , despite official efforts to force nomads to settle in newly built villages the nomads pass the winter near the lower towns before making the reverse migration once the snows begin melting a history museum in altay pays tribute to this way of life the altay region has been a paradise for nomadic peoples since ancient times , the text on one display says the tiele , scythians , xiongnu , xianbei , rouran , tujue , mongol and kazakh have lived here successively for thousands of years and created a splendid grassland culture they have contributed to the history of not only the altay region but also of xinjiang and china the bigtailed sheep of the region , especially those near fuhai lake , have been prized for more than 1 , 000 years , according to the during the tang dynasty \( 618 to 907 ad \) , rulers in the area sent sheep as tribute to the imperial court in xi'an during the 2008 summer olympics in beijing , the region s mutton was served as official food to athletes from muslim countries , according to an altay government website adult sheep can weigh more than 300 pounds , making them ideal for meat production the sheep are known for tails that weigh more than 20 pounds , where they store fat for the winter one recent day , aijamal dressed in a turquoise sweater and a red head scarf \( kazakhs are mostly sunni muslims \) and astride a white horse was watching over 200 sheep her two children were in a mudwalled shelter nearby she and her family were in the middle of their migration , driving the sheep down to winter pastures near a riverside village there , they would hire other herders to look after the sheep until the spring that is an increasingly common practice among some kazakhs , especially those who have traded their nomadic occupations for other pursuits we 'll stay here for a few days , aijamal said as she got off her horse then we 'll go down after the sheep have eaten she said she and her husband had just sold 80 lambs to two wholesale meat merchants , ethnic who were among the few uighur buyers visiting this year officials in xinjiang have been restricting their movements because of a surge in ethnic violence many resent rule by the han , the dominant ethnic group in china , and hundreds of people have been killed this year in chinese officials blame terrorist groups among the uighurs , though insurgency experts and scholars of xinjiang say they have seen no evidence of a widespread terrorist influence the shortage of buyers has also contributed to the drop in the price of sheep , aijamal said before , the uighurs would come north from urumqi to buy our sheep , she said , referring to the capital of xinjiang , a vast region that makes up onesixth of china but now many of them ca n't come the drought has been a much bigger problem , though this year , it killed 8 , 000 animals and destroyed 3 , 800 square kilometers of crops in northern xinjiang , according to a report in the state news media three million animals lack sufficient drinking water the civil affairs bureau said 800 , 000 people were affected , and officials estimate the economic loss at 47 billion renminbi , or 760 million some nomads were leaving earlier than usual from the summer pastures so their sheep could graze lower down north of the town of burqin , near a mountain pass , a man named los'han was dismantling his yurt with his family and tossing their furniture into the back of a white flatbed truck nomad families sometimes split the daily rental rate of 100 or more for a truck and driver for their migration my older brother is watching our sheep in the mountains , said los'han , 40 he 'll bring them down to join us east of altay , in the area of koktokay , a nomad on horseback pointed to some of his 200 or 300 sheep way too thin , he said soon there wo n't be any grass , said the man , urzbek , 62 maybe next year there will be none at all , because it has n't rained he lives with his family in one of a halfdozen white yurts by a road leading to the , a yosemitelike valley with towering granite peaks through which the irtysh river flows to the arctic ocean in the park , nomads were coming down from the summer pastures each day with camel caravans on this morning , urzbek s daughter walked among their sheep to help ensure that none of them wandered off a halfdozen camels that his family owns loped in formation , tied together , near the dry hills then there was the horse on which urzbek rode my horse is more important than my life , he said he began riding off i need to keep the sheep in line , he said he whistled and cracked a short whip to get the sheep moving
when augusta national golf club opened in 1933 , there were few hints at the grandeur of its future bobby jones , having retired from golf as an amateur at age 28 , wanted a place to play golf in private after winning 13 major titles , he was swarmed at any golf course he strolled on to , so he sought a course of his own , where he could invite his friends to join as members clifford roberts , an investment banker and friend , helped him acquire the 385 acres that would become augusta national and together they steered their little club into history they started the augusta national invitational in 1934 , which would become the masters and one of golf s four majors that status eventually rattled augusta out of its most exclusionary membership policies it invited its first black members in the 1990s and its first female ones in 2012 its fate was transformed by the star golfers who used the masters as their big stage , players like byron nelson , sam snead , ben hogan , arnold palmer , jack nicklaus and tiger woods but the club has also tried to hang on to a bit of its oldtime feel , as well as its lofty sense of selfimportance that , it seemed , began before the first golf ball was struck writing in 1933 , the associated press described augusta s debut after three years of work the augusta national golf club will officially open with a gala golf party bringing together famous personages of the golf and business world , friday , jan 13 , 1933 , augusta , ga the 18 hole course , built on a 385 acre nursery tract , is a veritable paradise of semitropical foliage none other than robert tyre \( bobby \) jones , king of golfers , and president of the club was behind every blue print and literally every shovel full of dirt during the construction of the course , collaborating with dr alister mackenzie , famous scot golf architect many of the 18 holes are prototypes of famous holes of the st andrews and north berwick courses in scotland and other courses throughout the world this course , says president jones , fulfills four fundamental requirements of golf 1 \) it requires as much mental effort as it does golfing skill 2 \) it gives the average player an excellent chance to do his best , while the expert must bring all his resources into play to keep within par 72 3 \) it gives pleasure to the greatest number of golfers 4 \) it contains natural hazards and more natural beauty than any course in the world the augusta national golf club is nonprofitmaking and under the jones influence will be used for golf and golf only no social functions being permitted
barcelona , spain on a recent evening , two vacationing german college students , armed with addresses they had gotten off the internet , were trying to get into one of barcelona s new marijuana clubs they were not members but no matter they quickly found a club near the city s central boulevard , la rambla , that was willing to ignore the rules , helping them choose from a dozen strains of marijuana for sale in plastic bins before letting them settle into the cushy lounge area to light up fortyfive minutes later , they were back on the street , smiling it was very nice , said one of the students , who had researched cannabis clubs before choosing barcelona as a holiday destination we will go back tomorrow the number of cannabis clubs that have opened in barcelona recently has some experts saying this city will soon challenge amsterdam as the goto destination for vacationers who want to get high in peace even as amsterdam has wrestled with drug tourism in recent years , reducing the number of coffee shops where it is legal to buy and smoke marijuana and hashish , about 300 new cannabis clubs have opened in barcelona and the surrounding catalan region , a result , at least in part , of enterprising spaniards looking for new ways to earn a living , experts say it is not that barcelona officials have given their blessing to this new phenomenon the clubs are operating under decadesold spanish laws that allow anyone to grow and smoke marijuana in private or to band together with others to form a cannabis club , as long as it is a nonprofit organization for members only , something like a chess or a cooking club but in the last three years , new clubs have opened , particularly in tourist areas like la rambla , in many cases circumventing the spirit , if not the letter , of the law while some clubs refuse walkin customers like the german college students , many of them offer membership \( about 20 euros , or about 27 \) over the internet or by phone the clubs vary enormously , from basement rooms equipped with foosball tables and huge television sets , to more elegant settings with designer chandeliers and fresh fruit drink bars some give marijuana away to those who use it for medical purposes and see a business in this area others cater only to recreational users few of the clubs are noticeable from the street the rambla dragon club , for instance , which opened last year , is on the ground floor of an apartment building only a small sign over the doorbell \( as well as the constant presence of young people squinting to read it \) indicates its presence it has the feel of a starbucks without windows , its high ceilings and a mighty ventilation system keeping the air fresh some of the smokers sit at tables with their laptops open others sit in on sofas , watching movies on a giant screen some cannabis advocates say the clubs are a bright spot in the economy though they are nonprofits , advocates say the clubs are generating thousands of jobs and tax revenues for the state in addition to selling a wide array of cannabis products and hashish , many of the clubs also sell food and drinks and offer extras to their members , like live music nights and pilates classes albert ti , the president of fedcac , an association of cannabis clubs in the region of catalonia that includes barcelona , said the clubs now had 165 , 000 members , up from virtually none five years ago his association was formed in 2011 , with only a handful of clubs in existence , he said one reason for the growth , he said , was that young people saw the clubs as a way to make a living another factor , he said , was barcelona s new antismoking laws , which went into effect in bars and restaurants in january 2011 and sent cannabis smokers , who are often also tobacco smokers , looking for new places to congregate the reality is this , mr ti said consumers think this is better than buying drugs on the street regional officials say that many of the clubs do cater mostly to spaniards , including one club in which all the members are women in their 80s but barcelona officials are so concerned about the rapid increase in such establishments and this city s growing reputation as a place to get a legal high that they decided in june to put a oneyear moratorium on new licenses while they consider issues such as proximity to schools yes , it s a problem , said joan delort , the head of prevention , security and mobility for barcelona in a very few years , you have a huge registration of cannabis users it is very hard to determine what is really going on but in 18 months , you have clubs that are in a very small location , that have registered 4 , 000 members it s just impossible that they could have that many some of the biggest names in the marijuana world are here the strain hunters , for instance , a dutch group that makes documentaries about the hunt for native strains of marijuana around the world , opened a club here in march , on a charming side street not far from la rambla with oneway windows that give the space an open and airy feel , but prevents passersby from looking in , it has the look and the feel of an upscale bar for those who want to get an early start , coffee and fresh croissants are available for breakfast , and members can opt for rarer cannabis products , such as pure cannabis resin in the shape of a butterfly websites that review the clubs , such as marijuanagamesorg and webehighorg , are giving barcelona clubs high marks for both the quality and the variety of cannabis products they sell , as well as for offering a far more pleasant atmosphere than most amsterdam coffee shops , which they say usually offer stale marijuana on a recent morning , olivier vervaet , a 21yearold nightclub worker , was at the strain hunters club looking over the cannabis menu while having a coffee i joined because this was just a great place to relax , he said i can sit down , and someone will bring me a drink and a joint , and i do n't have to worry about the police a few times a month , the police have stepped in , taking action against clubs caught leafleting on the street , for instance but edward sallent , the inspector general of community policing for the catalan regional police , said it was difficult to move against the clubs it s a complex situation because a lot of the acts and behaviors are not forbidden , he said selling and trafficking are illegal , but consumption , no many advocates say they believe the clubs are cutting down on street sales but mr sallent says he doubts that he says the clubs are too new to know exactly what impact they will have there may be all kinds of costs , he said maybe it will affect the value of property who knows \? some of those involved in managing the clubs in barcelona hope that spain will go further in legalizing marijuana soon though the clubs are run as nonprofit entities , some clearly represent big investments one such club , rmd , has set up an area for members who use marijuana to soothe the effects of chemotherapy or for other medical purposes it even hired a doctor to discuss their marijuana use and to help them with any issues that might arise tony levi , who coordinates this aspect of the club , said he became interested in the medical benefits of cannabis when his father had cancer he says he believes that eventually spain will recognize cannabis for medical use and that the services the club is providing will be covered by insurance i do see a business model here , he said
six teams have a bye in week 4 that leaves only 14 quality quarterbacks this week , as the drop off after cam newton in tier 5 is substantial kirk cousins was impressive for the second week in a row , earning him a spot in tier 4 it s going to be hard to count on anyone from tier 6 and beyond eli manning and victor cruz are n't quite the duo they used to be , teddy bridgewater has no run game support in minnesota and alex smith s floor remains extremely low in the runheavy kansas city offense jamaal charles and arian foster are both questionable as of thursday charles is currently in tier 3 and foster in tier 4 , but they could rise if their status becomes more clear neither khiry robinson or matt asiata were able to find the end zone last week , but high volume puts both of them in tier 5 it s interesting to see stevan ridley \( tier 5 \) and shane vereen \( tier 6 \) ranked so similarly to robinson \( tier 5 \) and pierre thomas \( tier 6 \) , as both pairs are in even timeshares for new england and new orleans detroit targeted reggie bush eight times in the passing game last week compared to joique bell zero times , which puts bush one tier higher than bell this week in tier 9 , knile davis and toby gerhart have a small edge on chris johnson and darren mcfadden all three baltimore running backs are in tier 10 this week no one knows how the coaches will distribute carries between lorenzo taliaferro , bernard pierce and justin forsett many experts think taliaferro will eventually secure the starting job , but none of them are good choices this week victor cruz and vincent jackson are in similar positions and both land in tier 4 this week owners were likely worried through the first two weeks , but a touchdown for both last week , and signs of life from eli manning and a new quarterback in tampa bay should give owners hope again brandin cooks is now a full tier ahead of marques colston through 3 games , colston has 13 targets to cooks' 24 i would consider colston , golden tate and deandre hopkins the upper half of tier 6 , and reggie wayne , sammy watkins and ty hilton the bottom half tier 9 is a group that is trending down rueben randle is limited by quarterback woes , torrey smith has 18 targets , 6 catches and 85 yards compared to steve smith s 32 targets , 18 catches , and 270 yards , justin hunter s breakout potential is fading with jake locker s regression since week 1 and there is hardly enough passing production in tampa bay for vincent jackson , let alone mike evans in contrast , tier10 is a rising group we 'll see if allen robinson , jordan mathews and malcolm floyd can build on their promising week 3 performances with dennis pitta and kyle rudolph out with injuries , that leaves 12 quality tight ends for week 4 martellus bennett was the star of last week he gets a tier 2 spot this week , especially with brandon marshall still being affected by injuries larry donnell remains a midtier option despite his fumble last week , as he s still seen 23 targets on the year \( tied with rob gronkowski \) , which is sixth among all tight ends travis kelce s continued increased snap count has him locked in the top 12 dwyane allen , heath miller , owen daniels and charles clay in tier 5 make for decent options as well , but will be more touchdowndependent for points
jindo , south korea of all the images from the loss of a ferry in the cold waters off the southwest coast of south korea last week , perhaps none have angered south koreans more than those of the captain and his key crew members awkwardly and quickly fleeing their halfsubmerged vessel to the safety of a rescue boat , even as hundreds of their passengers remained trapped inside the captain , lee junseok , 69 , has yet to explain publicly why he abandoned the ship with people aboard an apparent violation of maritime protocol , if not the law as it sunk beneath the waves but a portrait of the ship s last voyage is emerging from crew members , survivors and a transcript of the vessel s final 40 minutes of communications with emergency dispatchers on shore it is a scene of rapidly building chaos in which the captain and his crew faced a series of tough choices , questionable decisions and mechanical failures including the apparent loss of the onboard communications system those factors may have all contributed to the ship s sinking and the death of at least scores , and more likely hundreds , of people the coast guard will arrive in 15 minutes please tell your passengers to wear life jackets , emergency dispatchers told the ferry about half an hour after it radioed for help now we have lost our ability to broadcast our messages , the ship responded crew members , using the ferry s intercom , had previously instructed passengers to stay where they were , thinking it would be safer even if you ca n't use your speaker , do your best to go out and ensure that your passengers wear life jackets or thick clothes , emergency dispatchers said if our passengers evacuate , will they be immediately rescued \? the ship responded let them float even with life rings hurry ! the dispatchers responded a minute later , they added we do n't know the situation there so the captain should make a final decision , and he should hurry to decide whether to evacuate them a communications officer , in a separate part of the ferry , said he never received instructions from the bridge to tell passengers to abandon ship one crew member on the bridge said he heard the captain give the order to evacuate , but that he did not hear the message broadcast to the passengers survivors have not reported hearing it when the ferry , the sewol , began its overnight journey at 9 pm last tuesday , embarking from a pier in incheon , west of seoul , and heading toward the southern resort island of jeju , its voyage seemed like so many others the ship had taken the 460footlong , fivestory ferry plied this 264mile route twice a week , along a busy shipping lane down the west coast of south korea it had 443 passengers on board 60 percent of its capacity most of them were secondyear high school students on what was supposed to be the last school trip before they entered a pressurecooker year of cramming for college entrance exams the ship also carried a full load of cargo , including 124 cars , 56 trucks and 105 shipping containers some of the students gathered on the deck watching fireworks bursting in the night sky below deck , others strolled in small groups or gathered in entertainment rooms to sing karaoke or play video games up in the pilothouse , on the ship s top deck , the crew worked in four shifts this ship left late because of fog , and oh yongseok , 58 , a helmsman , was on a second shift , taking the wheel under the guidance of a shipmate at 11 pm the water was calm , the night quiet , mr oh recalled in a series of interviews in the past week the captain stopped by the bridge from time to time to check on matters as mr oh handed over the controls to the third shift , mr oh suggested that crew members doublecheck the straps tying down the vehicles and cargo in the hold , he recalled on his round , he told them that he had noticed that several had come loose and he tightened them otherwise , he said , there were no issues with that , he retired to his berth and fell into a deep sleep the last shift began at 7 30 am , under the watch of park hangyeol , 26 , the youngest of the ship s mates she had been with the company only six months on this trip , her shift coincided with the passage of the ship through the most challenging section of the voyage a waterway known for its rapid and unpredictable currents and frequent ship accidents when the current hits the ship s side , it can throw the ship off course , mr oh said it s not easy to steer there ms park was navigating this notorious waterway for the first time , giving instructions to a helmsman at the wheel , according to prosecutors who have raised the question of how qualified she was for the difficult passage on monday , prosecutors detained the sewol s three remaining ship mates and its chief engineer for questioning investigators say the sewol appeared to make a sharp turn to the left around the time it began to tilt , and they were looking into whether unsecured cargo may have shifted , contributing to the accident the helmsman on duty , jo jungi , later told reporters that i made a mistake of my own , but the ship turned much more than usual a prosecutor said investigators were also looking into discrepancies between ms park s and mr jo s versions of what happened at 8 48 am , mr oh said , he was jolted awake as his body was thrown against the port side wall of his quarters the vessel had begun to list he lurched from his room barefoot and scrambled along the corridor of the ship toward the bridge the first person he saw was mr lee , the ship s captain mr lee , who had been in his room , had just clambered out of his cabin and , with the ship slowly turning onto its side , was now holding onto the doorway of the pilothouse , trying to pull himself inside and get control of the ship mr oh pushed the captain up and into the room and followed as well soon , all of the ship s mates and helmsmen had gathered there mr lee , clutching onto a pillar near the map table at the center of the bridge , began barking orders the ship was already listing so heavily everyone was hanging onto whatever they could grab , mr oh recalled it was clear we were in a really bad situation that situation would in short order get even worse investigators trying to reconstruct events have been weighing a range of possible causes , including pilot error an unexpected current failure in the ship s ballast loose or unbalanced cargo a recent addition of more cabins on the upper deck of the 20yearold ferry that may have impaired its ability to recover balance and loosely abided safety regulations at 8 55 am , with the ship tilting and unable to move , someone on the bridge asked the local maritime authorities to please come quickly , according to the transcript of the shiptoshore radio communications mr lee ordered the crew to right the ship but ms park said the ballast motor was not working , mr oh recalled at 9 05 am , the radio on shore crackled with another urgent message from the sewol what s going on with the coast guard \? a government emergency dispatcher began asking ships in the area to go to the sewol s aid two levels below , kang haeseong , one of the ship s communications officers , was in the broadcasting room and trying to figure out what to do with the ship listing about 30 degrees and cutlery falling off the shelves , he made an announcement on the public address system urging the passengers to stay where they were and not to move hastily i did n't have time to look at the manual but i thought i should calm people down first , he recalled in an interview mr lee said on friday that he did not order an immediate evacuation because he feared the passengers would be endangered by the strong currents and the cold water mr oh said mr lee first tried to get the ship s life rafts deployed his crew tried but could not make it to the lifeboats by 9 18 am , the sewol reported that it was listing at an angle of more than 50 degrees impossible to evacuate , someone on the sewol s bridge told emergency dispatchers by radio down below , mr kang contacted the coast guard using his cellphone and then continued to tell people on the public address system to remain where they were a little while longer because the rescue boats were coming at 9 23 am , the bridge sent another distress call we are about to sink as the ship continued to list and filled with water , mr kang and his colleagues stacked chairs to enable some passengers to climb to the fourth floor it was chaotic because everyone was just busy saving themselves and many people were n't pulling up the people below them , mr kang recalled mr oh said he heard mr lee , before leaving the bridge , give the order to evacuate , but mr oh did not hear it broadcast mr kang , the communications officer , said he never received the order a senior prosecutor said investigators were still trying to figure out whether it ever reached the passengers at 9 38 am , in the ship s last communication with emergency dispatchers , the bridge reported that the vessel was listing at 60 degrees those who can evacuate through the port side are trying it , a voice said over the radio all the crew members began to flee the bridge more than twothirds of the 29member crew , including the entire navigation team , survived only about a third of the passengers 174 got out alive by monday , 61 people had been confirmed dead and 241 were still missing mr oh saw mr lee slide down the floor of the wheelhouse and crash through a door in the portside wall the helmsman said it was not clear whether the captain was evacuating or had just lost his grip of the pole and fell he did not see mr lee again until an image of him was broadcast on television the captain was in handcuffs , charged with accidental homicide he was also charged with abandoning his passengers in a time of crisis , a crime punishable by up to life in prison
washington the house on tuesday passed a package of bills aimed at stemming human trafficking , an issue that has slowly begun to gain national attention the measures passed easily with bipartisan support , and versions of many of them already await consideration on the senate floor according to the justice department , may become victims of commercial sexual exploitation each year in the united states one measure addresses what many law enforcement experts say is among the most urgent problems in prosecuting sex trafficking the arrest of victims of forced prostitution , rather than customers or pimps the would encourage states to offer victims social and protective services , rather than prosecution , and provide job opportunities through the federal job corps program another measure seeks to shut down online sexual service advertisements by amending current united states laws in a way that does not run afoul of the first amendment , something that has stymied similar legislation in states one of the bills , also emulated in the senate , would try to stem the exploitation of children in the child welfare system who are often targeted by pimps another would notify foreign governments when americans convicted of the sexual abuse of a minor travel abroad and the would invest in services to aide victims of sexual trafficking while an interest in human trafficking has long been a focus of conservatives , the issue has attracted significant bipartisan interest in recent months representative eric cantor , republican of virginia and the house majority leader , held a news conference on tuesday to push the legislation , an usual amount of attention for lowprofile measures \( though the legislation had broad support from democrats , none attended the news conference , and some expressed concern that one measure would lead to mandatory minimum sentencing for a newly proposed offense \) mr cantor , who has been looking to move legislative focus in the house away from fiscal issues , has taken an interest in human trafficking as other members have presented him with data demonstrating the broad scope of the problem and its impact on a vast array of communities the house has assembled a working group to keep focus on the issue many of these victims represent the most vulnerable people on earth , mr cantor said tuesday on the house floor , including individuals with mental disabilities and children stolen from their homes and taken from their loving moms and dads , with very little chance of ever seeing their families again several senators from both parties are hoping to pass similar legislation soon , amid hope that a rare compromise with the house is in the offing , potentially producing some of the most significant legislation on this issue in years there is a strong interest in getting these done in the senate , said senator amy klobuchar , democrat of minnesota , whose bill would require states to treat child prostitutes as victims rather than as criminal defendants i am sure we can reach a compromise human trafficking is the thirdlargest criminal enterprise in the world , and the reason there is so much interest in these bills is because 83 percent of the victims are from our country
aspen , colo the trend in boutique museum building reached a chilly , sungilded peak a few years ago and has leveled out , at least in the united states these days we mostly get and , and the critical conversation has moved on still , celebrity commissions appear a renzo pianodesigned satellite for the whitney museum of american art is underway in lower manhattan and last month , a new home for the aspen art museum designed by the japanese architect shigeru ban , , made its debut here the building , which opened to a , has its virtues and they are not small it also embodies some of the absurdities and contradictions that have given starchitecture a bad name yet the aspen museum itself as an institution which is modest in size , collects no art and has free admission offers , at least potentially , a working model for what a new kind of 21stcentury museum , regional or otherwise , could be the particular regional setting in this case is a promising one aspen , set high in the rockies , is physically gorgeous socioeconomically , it s a very strange place founded as a goldandsilver mining camp in the 19th century , it is now a migratory perch for a significant percentage of the nation s financial elite dozens of forbes 400 billionaires own property here landgrabbing mansions dot the hillsides private jets jam the tiny aspen airport like a fleet of waiting cabs given that some of those billionaires , leonard lauder , etc are major art collectors , it makes sense that the town , despite its remoteness and primary identity as a ski resort , should have an art museum , though the one that exists today is quite different from what it once was the original aspen art museum opened in 1979 in a onegallery space in a repurposed hydroelectric station for years most of the exhibitions were of local artists , including student shows grassroots was the word for it with the arrival of heidi zuckerman jacobson as director and chief curator in 2005 she came from the berkeley art museum that identity changed she organized shows by buzzy young east and west coast figures , with some international artists folded in a new yorker would have known every one after assembling a supportive board , she proposed moving and expanding the museum in 2007 , it commissioned mr ban he was a gutsy choice at that point , like some of ms zuckerman jacobson s artists , he was still only a semibankable name he had never built a permanent museum his reputation rested mainly on his imaginative designs for temporary , disasterrelief housing using cheap , recyclable materials hollow cardboard tubes , treated paper , canvas tarps , plastic sheeting he had applied this technology to shelters for victims of natural and manmade catastrophes in africa , india and japan wherever emergency struck , he seemed ready to go his dogooder bona fides were what sold him to the board members , and they make him a piquant choice for a town in which possession , not dispossession , rules and environmentalism have powerful foes \( the koch brothers , charles , david and william , notable opponents to climate control legislation , own significant property here \) the building he has delivered is a curious one , uglybeautiful a threestory glass cube enclosed in thick latticework of waterproofed paper where some viewers will see the inspiration of japanese basketry , others will see a grim , squat cage the building is shoehorned into a tight corner lot at a downtown intersection , emphasizing both the structure s 33 , 000squarefoot bulk and its cultural estrangement from the victorianstyle buildings around it the interior , by contrast , is conventional , with \( counting the basement \) three levels of plain whitebox galleries topped with a , restaurant and terrace with a skislope view signature elements of mr ban s disaster designs molded paper outside , cardboard tubing inside have been incorporated throughout and one of the building s several inaugural shows , shigeru ban humanitarian architecture , seeks to associate the museum with the architect s many relief projects the exhibition is gripping , with photographs and fullscale examples of tentlike structures he s made for hardhit places around the world , from rwanda to new orleans \( where the show travels this fall \) but it has no substantive relationship to the 45 million building it s in in this case , paper and tubing are often merely decorative detail no mention is made of the many nonrelief projects mr ban has undertaken , including the recent design of for extremely rich clients , including the cast iron house condominiums in manhattan it s in the nature of art museums to want to paper over yawning gaps between social reality and aesthetic illusion make them a single , acceptable , excusable thing i 'd go as far as to say that most museums take this as their main task in this regard , the aspen art museum , judging by its current shows , is typical , no better , no worse another of those shows is , like the ban exhibition , quite strong titled david hammons yves klein yves klein david hammons , it brings together , in a compareandcontrast way , a pair of familiar artists the american and klein \( 192862 \) , a frenchman who turn out to share unexpected interests in experimenting with natural materials \( rain , fire and sponges in klein s case coal , grease and hair in mr hammons s \) , in the economics of immateriality \( klein traded empty space for gold mr hammons hawked snowballs on the street \) , and in the use of direct prints of the human body as sensual and political images none of this is explained in words , though i wish some of it were ms zuckerman jacobson has referred to the museum as a sacred space and refrains from sullying it , or art , with interpretive texts even without them , conversations between the works are evident , though it s easy to imagine some visitors seeing just woozy abstraction with images added information , take it or leave it , is good the new building s other exhibitions are conscientiously global , but without surprises a handful of ceramic pieces by the german artist tells us little we did n't know about her a tworoom display of preciouslooking abstract drawings by another german , is a room too many an installation by the chinese artist , incorporating live tortoises with ipads fixed to their shells , ran into trouble animalrights groups raised a hullabaloo , and the tortoises were retired ahead of schedule two good shows out of five is better than average , but is good enough \? the museum clearly wants to position itself within a national and international orbit and beyond regional status its way of doing this at present is by importing marketvetted talent from the coastal art centers where aspen s flyover collecting class presumably shops my question is , why settle for being a new yorklos angeles outpost \? why not take advantage of the excitements that regional consciousness can offer , and by doing so chip away at the tired east coastwest coast hegemony \? the aspen art museum s founders were wise to create a noncollecting , communityserving museum on the classic european kunsthalle model , a model that assures that even residents of small cities have access to art and some say about the choice of it unencumbered by the financial pressures of buying art , the technical demands of caring for it and the urge to expand to store it , the kunsthalle can , ideally , stay light on its feet when a show ends , everything goes back to where it came from , leaving a clean deck that can be refilled in inventive ways at least two major new york institutions had a brush with something like this model in their histories the new museum , founded in 1977 as the new museum of contemporary art , decided it would keep no art in its collection for more than 20 years the museum of modern art , beginning in 1947 , sold the metropolitan museum certain older works from its holdings to make room for new ones both the new museum and moma soon abandoned such policies , but the instinct behind it was refreshing do n't get bogged down , pass things along , bring in the constantly changing new there has never been more new art in america than there is today thousands of art schools and galleries across the country are producing students , to say nothing of artists who work on their own only a small fraction of them can , or feel impelled to , relocate to new york , chicago or los angeles many smaller cities have vital art scenes of their own , yet no dedicated venues for showcasing it a kunsthalle like the aspen art museum , an institution somewhere between a museum and alternative space , should make room for artists closer to home , and in so doing help break up the longstanding artcenter stranglehold not all such institutions need the 746 million that ms zuckerman jacobson has raised for her museum \( after the building is paid for there s still a 296 million endowment left \) indeed , an argument could be made that lesstolose modest can be better for art , encouraging chancetaking still , whether there are megabucks or not , what s needed first is the will to believe , the will to treat local what s here as big league instead of perpetuating the myth that innovative , important and valuable can emerge only from somewhere else
the , the extremist militant group now almost universally vilified for atrocities that include boastful beheadings , summary mass executions and enslavement in the areas it aspires to control , also has attacked enemies with , the banned weapons that kill and maim indiscriminately , said on monday stephen goose , the arms division director of human rights watch , said in a that credible evidence had emerged that isis forces used groundfired cluster munitions on july 12 and aug 14 during fighting with kurdish militia members in aleppo province near the northern syrian border with turkey the use of cluster munitions by nonstate actors such as the islamic state shows the urgent need for and all nations that have not yet done so to join the ban on cluster munitions and destroy their stockpiles , human rights watch said in the statement the group cited reports by kurdish officials and photographic evidence to corroborate its assertions , saying that at least four kurdish fighters and a child had been killed by the cluster munitions attacks human rights watch said it was unclear how isis had acquired the munitions , which syrian government forces also have used repeatedly despite worldwide condemnation fired by rockets , mortars and artillery or dropped from aircraft , cluster bombs explode in midair , hurtling hundreds of lethal submunitions known as bomblets over a wide area many of the bomblets fail to explode immediately , effectively creating booby traps for the unsuspecting last week the cluster munition coalition , an organization of advocacy groups including human rights watch , that syrian government forces had used cluster bombs starting in 2012 in their campaign to crush an insurgency , surpassing israel s use of the weapons in the 2006 war in lebanon that led to the global treaty banning their use in 2008 the human rights watch report came on the eve of the cluster munition coalition s annual meeting , to be held tuesday through friday in san jose , costa rica , where compliance with the treaty will be discussed aside from syria , cluster bomb use has been reported this year in the conflicts in south sudan and ukraine none are among the 113 countries that have signed the treaty fiftyone have not signed , including the united states , russia and china , though all three countries abide by the treaty s provisions
washington lawyers for three couples challenging utah s ban on samesex marriage said thursday that they would join with their opponents to urge the supreme court to hear their case , even though they recently won an appeals court ruling striking down the law the unusual move could hasten a final ruling from the supreme court on samesex marriage it also reflects confidence among proponents of samesex marriage that the court would rule in their favor now is the time for the supreme court to bring certainty to this fundamental civil rights issue of our time , said , a lawyer for the couples on tuesday , utah officials to hear their appeal and uphold the state s ban on samesex marriage we recognize this litigation has caused uncertainty and disruption and have accordingly tried to expedite its resolution as quickly as possible , said , utah s attorney general all utah citizens will benefit when the supreme court provides clear finality on the important issue of state authority to define marriage ms tomsic said she found herself in agreement with her adversary on one point we absolutely agree that this is a critical issue for decision , she said , and she praised state officials for moving the case along quickly it is quite uncommon for the winning side to urge the justices to hear an appeal , but there have been a handful of notable exceptions recently one of them was , in which a chain of craft stores that had won in the appeals court nonetheless to hear the government s appeal and ultimately won in the supreme court , too , a former acting united states solicitor general who also represents the utah couples , said the importance of the issue warranted an unusual approach this is the defining issue for the supreme court in our lifetime , he said the notion that the government could deny life s greatest partnership on the basis of orientation is capricious and strikes at everything this country is about he said the couples would file a brief in the coming weeks joining utah s request that the supreme court hear the case such a filing would come in time for the justices to consider the case at their first private conference when they return from their summer break should the justices agree to hear the case , they could schedule arguments in the winter and issue a decision by june there are other samesex marriage cases in the pipeline , including ones from federal appeals courts striking down bans in oklahoma and virginia the supreme court could agree to hear one or more of the several cases , or none of them most of the usual signs suggest the court will step in it is no small thing for a lower federal court to strike down a state law or a provision of a state constitution , and that alone may warrant review the supreme court has indicated its interest in developments in utah by stays that blocked lower court rulings that would have allowed gay marriages to proceed or be recognized and it cannot hurt that both sides in the utah case agree the case should be heard all that is missing from the standard criteria for supreme court review is disagreement in the lower courts , which have unanimously ruled against samesex marriage bans in the last year a set of cases by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit , in cincinnati , may soon supply that last element two other federal appeals courts are also scheduled to hear appeals in the coming weeks the utah came from the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit , in denver it said an amendment to the utah constitution defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman denied gay couples the fundamental right to marry under the federal constitution in urging the supreme court to hear the case , utah officials said the ruling had deprived the state s voters , who adopted the ban in a 2004 referendum , of a different fundamental right , one allowing them to act through a lawful electoral process a vast cloud covers this entire area of the law , and only this court can lift it , said this case provides an ideal vehicle to do just that here , too , ms tomsic said she agreed with her adversaries that uncertainty over samesex marriage is intolerable we are one country , she said even if you are in a state that recognizes samesex marriage , you are at risk if you travel or move she added it is fitting that the first in the current wave of samesex marriage cases comes from utah if it can happen in utah , it can happen anywhere , she said we are a very conservative state
the ' offense was anemic , their bullpen was tattered , and it was only the third game of the season their starting pitching would have to carry them , it seemed last year , when things turned dire , they turned to matt harvey for hope that role has fallen to zack wheeler , their other young phenom in his first full season in the major leagues , wheeler was expected to lead , maybe even pitch like an ace but even wheeler could not save the mets on thursday against the  he labored through washington s potent lineup , throwing 114 pitches over six innings he allowed only three runs and gave the mets a chance , but their bullpen surrendered five more runs , their offense failed to score after the first inning , and  the nationals' threegame sweep to start the season magnified the mets' deficiencies after opening day , citi field was mostly empty the announced attendance thursday afternoon was 20 , 561 , but it seemed possible to handcount every fan the last time the mets started 03 was 2005 , when they started 05 en route to an 8379 season i can assure you that we 're better than what we 've seen the last three days , manager terry collins said jordan zimmermann , who won 19 games last year , was supposed to start for the nationals but he was reportedly up all night vomiting , so tanner roark , a 27yearold with five career starts , was told thursday morning he would be pitching the mets attacked roark in the first inning daniel murphy , playing his first game of the season , ripped a single , david wright singled on a popup that denard span lost in the sun , and curtis granderson roped a double to right field , scoring murphy then lucas duda drew a 10pitch walk , bringing up juan lagares with the bases loaded lagares had impressed the mets with his new approach at the plate he was patient he was not chasing pitches he was not being fooled by low curveballs he had already proved last season that he was a superb defender , and the mets had said he would play every day in center field if he could hit consistently he had four hits , three for extra bases , in the first two games he s capable of that , said dave hudgens , the hitting coach it s not surprising now lagares hit a sacrifice fly , giving the mets a 20 lead he also doubled in the fourth inning but was stranded he would finish 1 for 3 roark settled in , throwing six strong innings , and the nationals' bullpen finished the rest the mets managed just 10 runs seven of them on opening day in three games against the nationals collins started three different first basemen ike davis , lucas duda and josh satin and none of them had much success collins said that starting friday he would pick one first baseman , presumably davis or duda , and give him a chance to play every day duda appears to be the favorite because davis s failures have been more pronounced meanwhile , with the lack of offense , wheeler had little room for error he gave up a solo home run to ryan zimmerman and then walked the no 8 hitter , catcher sandy leon , to start the fifth inning , during which the nationals scored two runs otherwise , wheeler was mostly effective , in part because of his changeup last season , he switched to a fourseam changeup it was a slower pitch with more depth , he said it also had the same spin as his fourseam fastball and looked the same out of his hand , which confused hitters he worked on it more during spring training and grew confident in it he recalled using it to strike out bryce harper it s a big weapon , said travis d'arnaud , the mets' catcher wheeler struck out six batters and worked around seven hits and two walks to keep the score close , 32 but then came the mets' bullpen , which may be the team s weakest link scott rice and jeurys familia combined to allow four runs in the seventh on four hits , one walk and a throwing error by murphy carlos torres allowed two hits , two walks and another run in the eighth murphy was back after missing the first two games for the birth of his first child he had been criticized on talk radio for going on paternity leave , and before the game he said that his wife , tori , had undergone a cesarean section and was physically exhausted he said he simply wanted to be there to help her collins rushed to his defense , saying , incredulously , the man had his first child murphy went 1 for 3 , but he committed two errors after the game bobby parnell , who was supposed to be the team s closer this season , was in the clubhouse he had been given a plateletrich plasma injection to help his partly torn ulnar collateral ligament and was told to rest for two weeks before throwing again he and the mets will know in a few weeks if he needs tommy john surgery , and parnell said he had been told there was about

arizona was locked in a difficult game against colorado on friday night in las vegas when the buffaloes' xavier johnson swooped down the lane for a onehanded dunk but a notsostrange thing happened on the way to a momentum swing high above the rim , the arizona freshman aaron gordon jammed the jam with a hand of his own it was one of the 17 shots that colorado missed in the second half of arizona s runaway 6343 victory the buffaloes made just five arizona \( 304 , 153 pacific12 \) , seeded first in the west , will take bigname talent to the ncaa tournament gordon is expected to jump to the nba next season guard nick johnson was the pac12 player of the year , and his two alleyoop dunks , one a reverse , were highlights against colorado but if arizona reaches its first final four since 2001 , and wins its first national title since 1997 , it will be on the strength of its mantoman defense the wildcats led the nation in defensive efficiency , allowing 873 points per 100 possessions during the regular season that worked out to 587 points a game , the sixthbest mark in the country talk about oldschool defense it is the fewest points allowed by arizona since 195051 in the pac12 tournament , arizona began by holding utah , the bestshooting team in the conference , to 39 points and a 255 percent fieldgoal percentage colorado fared little better it is a point of pride for the wildcats johnson , at 6 feet 3 inches , usually guards the top perimeter scorer on the other team , regardless of height utah s delon wright arrived thursday averaging more than 16 points , but he scored none against johnson wright finished with 5 points , all after johnson sat down during the blowout victory it s about shutting the man down and making his life miserable , johnson said defense can be hard to appreciate , especially on a team with the kind of flash that arizona possesses there are no tricks to this , arizona coach sean miller said it s get back in transition it s defend the ball it s having a system to defend screens same thing with the low post arizona never wavers from its mantoman principles win or lose , maybe all the way to a national championship that s our philosophy , miller said , and we have these guys doing it right now , for sure marcus smart receives most of the attention , but oklahoma state forward le'bryan nash might be just as valuable to the cowboys a mcdonald s allamerican coming out of high school in dallas , nash was thought to be a oneanddone player now a junior , he has given oklahoma state leadership as well as 142 points a game and 52 percent shooting , the secondhighest percentage in the big 12 meet sim bhullar , the 7foot5 , 355pound center for new mexico state bhullar scored in double figures in six of his last seven games and finished fifth in the nation with 356 blocks a game next season could be even more daunting for opponents bhullar s 7foot3 younger brother , tanveer , will be ready to join him after redshirting this season nebraska could be dangerous for baylor coach tim miles has infused his team with energy , and the guards can shoot a win over the bears would set up an allnebraska secondround matchup with creighton points scored by creighton s doug mcdermott in his career it s the fifthmost in ncaa history

baghdad wearing a black turban and black robes , the leader of the selfproclaimed islamic state that stretches across eastern syria and much of northern and western made a startling public appearance , his first in many years , at a wellknown mosque in the iraqi city of mosul , according to a video released on saturday whose contents were confirmed by experts and witnesses until then , there had been very few photographs on the internet of the insurgent known as abu bakr albaghdadi , the leader of the , or but on friday he delivered a public sermon in a city once under american control with an audacity that even osama bin laden never tried isis released a of the sermon on saturday previously he had been all but invisible , seemingly reluctant to risk a public appearance as his group grew in strength and he became the united states' secondmost soughtafter terrorist , after ayman alzawahri , the leader of al qaeda the united states government has offered a 10 million reward for information leading to his capture but on friday at the pulpit of mosul s great mosque , mr baghdadi appeared confident , calm and measured as he urged the faithful to fast during ramadan and undertake jihad he also asserted his position as caliph , or spiritual leader , of the muslim faithful , calling himself khalifa ibrahim , or caliph abraham , a reference to the prophet abraham , who appears in the quran mr baghdadi s militant group in iraq and syria a caliphate , or islamic state , on june 29 do jihad in the cause of god , incite the believers and be patient in the face of this hardship , he admonished the congregation if you knew about the reward and dignity in this world and the hereafter through jihad , then none of you would delay in doing it isis militants mosul , iraq s secondlargest city , on june 10 , after the iraqi army fled isis fighters patrol the streets , although far fewer than in the first days after the takeover , and while some people have gone back to work , the city is far from normal the congregation at the mosque in the video had been ordered to come to friday prayer , said a man who was there but who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution when worshipers arrived at the mosque , they were searched thoroughly by armed isis fighters , and the congregants were told where and how to sit , said the man no one was allowed to leave until 10 minutes after the end of mr baghdadi s sermon , the man said the sermon was no extemporaneous cameo , but a carefully crafted speech in which he asked for the congregation s support and struck an almost humble and pious tone that was difficult to square with the group s tactics on the ground , which include kidnapping for ransom , summary executions and beheadings i was placed as your caretaker , and i am not better than you , he said , according to a translation by , which monitors extremist activity online so if you found me to be right , then help me , and if you found me to be wrong , then advise me and make me right i do not promise you , as the kings and rulers promise their followers and congregation , luxury , security and relaxation instead , i promise you what allah promised his faithful worshipers , he said mr baghdadi s address appeared to be aimed at several audiences , analysts said he seemed to be appealing to followers of other militant groups in syria and iraq to join isis , and also to iraqi sunnis to look to him as a leader rather than the iraqi government daniel benjamin , a senior counterterrorism official in the state department from 2009 to 2012 , said that if the video was authentic , mr baghdadi s appearance would be a remarkable event if baghdadi has emerged from hiding , it suggests that he is adopting a posture as a different kind of leader from osama bin laden , ayman alzawahri and the like , and by implication a greater one , said mr benjamin , now a scholar at dartmouth college he is demonstrating that isis has what they did n't territory that is secure , and he is its ruler as a public demonstration of leadership , you 'd have to go back to april 1996 , when mullah omar appeared on top of a building in kandahar in a cloak that was said to belong to the prophet and was declared commander of the faithful , mr benjamin added peter neumann , a professor of security studies at kings college london , said the appearance was a sign of confidence and a message to all these other jihadists , this is really happening , it s not going to go away anytime soon the video was still being authenticated late saturday by the central intelligence agency a spokesman for the iraqi interior ministry , brig gen saad maan , told reuters that the ministry thought it was fake , but mr neumann said he had little doubt that it was authentic , in part because isis would have little to gain from a falsified video an american official who spent extensive time in iraq said that the man in the video appeared to be mr baghdadi two people who were in the mosque when mr baghdadi spoke said they had no question it was him but they had never seen him before , so their certainty was based primarily on how the isis fighters treated him also on saturday , official iranian news agencies reported that an iranian pilot had been killed in fighting in iraq , which appeared to be the first confirmation of the deployment of iranian forces there there have been unconfirmed reports that iran had sent military advisers and jets to iraqthe islamic republic news agency said that the pilot , col shoja'at alamdari , was killed in samarra defending a shiite shrine the fars news agency said that he was a member of the islamic revolutionary guards corps the agencies provided no further details about his death , and it was not clear whether he died on the ground or in the air there have been no reports of planes shot down by the rebels
chicago one priest , the rev william j cloutier , was accused of raping a boy in his summer cottage , locking the door when the 13yearold started screaming , and then brandishing a handgun while threatening to kill him if he told anyone another , the rev robert c becker , would take boys to a trailer where , they said , he slept beside them and molested them and the rev joseph r bennett was accused of raping a girl with the handle of a paten , a plate used to hold eucharistic bread thousands of documents gleaned from the personnel files of the archdiocese of chicago were released to the public on tuesday , unspooling a lurid history of abuse by priests and halting responses from bishops in the country s thirdlargest archdiocese in each case , the priests ultimately died or were ousted from ministry , and in most cases , the allegations were never proved in a criminal court but the documents suggest that church officials were at times quite solicitous toward priests accused of abuse in one remarkable instance in 1997 , gov tommy thompson of wisconsin was persuaded to allow the body of an abusive priest s mother to be brought to the prison where the priest , the rev norbert j maday , was incarcerated so he could pay his respects cardinal francis e george , the roman catholic archbishop of chicago , described the accommodation in a thankyou note as an exceptional act of charity cardinal george s predecessor , cardinal joseph l bernardin , opted not to defrock the same priest , writing a letter to him in prison declaring that you have suffered enough by your present deprivation of ministry and your incarceration on tuesday , shortly after the documents were , the archdiocese of chicago published a statement again apologizing for abuse by priests and declaring , the archdiocese acknowledges that its leaders made some decisions decades ago that are now difficult to justify we realize the information included in these documents is upsetting , the statement said it is painful to read it is not the church we know or the church we want to be a few hours later , abuse victims and their lawyers gathered in the 23rdfloor ballroom of a downtown hotel , lined up in front of posters and a video screen displaying photographs of priests accused of abusing minors at the side of a lectern sat three cardboard boxes filled with copies of the files , a lawyer who has represented numerous victims of clergy sexual abuse around the nation , said the documents depicted a systematic , ongoing , decadeslong , continuous pattern of conscious choices by top officials of the archdiocese , and argued that church officials were complicit in the abuse when they failed to remove abusers from ministry the priorities have been demonstrated to have been the protection of the offenders and the reputation of the archdiocese , he said later , turning to the victims beside him , he said , these children were not as important to them as the clergy were most of the abuse described in the documents was alleged to have taken place years ago about half of the accused priests are dead , and many of the victims have already been given financial settlements from the archdiocese some of the documents have previously been available online , and have received attention in local news reports , as a result of criminal prosecutions and civil suits but the victims have pressed for public release of the files , arguing that the comprehensive set of documents will provide an important form of reckoning , chronicling what church officials did , and did not do , when they learned of accusations that priests had molested minors for some of us it will be answers , for some of us it will be peace of mind , for some of us it s wanting to know , but for all of us it s a start , said angel santiago , 47 , who won a 700 , 000 settlement from the archdiocese in 2011 after accusing the rev joseph l fitzharris of abusing him in the early 1980s it s a little more weight off my shoulders , he said , but i still carry some of it father fitzharris , who acknowledged abusing multiple boys , was defrocked in 2009 father cloutier , whose threats with the gun were investigated but not prosecuted by the local police in 1979 , went on to face further accusations of abuse he resigned from the priesthood in 1993 and died in 2003 father becker , who in 1986 wrote in a letter to cardinal bernardin about how full of shame i feel for having betrayed you and the archdiocese , died in 1989 father bennett , who denied most of the many accusations against him , resigned from the priesthood in 2012 the personnel files of accused priests have previously been made public in other american dioceses , including boston and los angeles , generally as a result of litigation most of the documents have been published in an online archive ,  the archdiocese of chicago has paid about 100 million to settle abuse allegations against priests the archdiocese has also posted to its website none still in ministry who the church said have been credibly accused of abusing minors the documents released tuesday concern 30 priests whose files were subject to negotiations with victims' lawyers a lawyer for the accused priests , joseph v roddy , said the documents' accusations should be read with caution , because some were tested in criminal court , but in the vast majority of cases , they 're just allegations an archdiocesan lawyer that 95 percent of the allegations in the files concerned conduct before 1988 , and none after 1996 14 of the 30 accused priests are dead , and none are still serving in ministry cardinal george , who has been the archbishop of chicago since 1997 , has said he never met many of the priests the release of the chicago files comes as cardinal george , and one of the leading intellectuals in the american church hierarchy , is awaiting permission from the vatican to retire pope francis' choice of a new archbishop of chicago will be closely watched as it will probably be the pope s first appointment to lead a major american see although the abuse described in the documents took place before cardinal george became archbishop , many of the victims first came forward after his arrival some of the files concern cases in which , including that of the , whose disciplinary proceeding the cardinal briefly delayed , and father , whose prison sentence the cardinal sought to reduce it would be a great fulfillment of the millennium spirit to see your captive heart set free , cardinal george wrote to the incarcerated father maday in 2000 but the cardinal later changed his mind in 2007 , after several more people had come forward to say they had been abused by father maday , the cardinal wrote to a parole commission , saying he was seeking to defrock the priest the documents also shed new light on the handling of abusers by cardinal bernardin , , and one of the first prominent church figures by naming a board in 1992 to

the odds of catching for the no1 ranking this year are now objectively long but heading into the atp world tour finals that begin sunday in london , federer still has a chance , and sometimes a chance is all that is required remember , where marat safin , much like djokovic this time , was the man in command three victories in those yearend championships would have secured the top ranking for the russian he could manage only two before losing to in his final roundrobin match and then to in the semifinals but neither sampras nor agassi would take the trophy gustavo kuerten , normally no master of indoor tennis , beat them on consecutive days to become the unlikely champion and the only south american man to finish a year at no1 it had to be like the perfect storm , said brad gilbert , who was coaching agassi that year safin had two chances to clinch it , and kuerten would have lost it if he had lost any of his last four matches instead , the elastic brazilian won them all despite an ailing hamstring , earning the rare chance to deliver a victory speech in portuguese , his mother tongue fourteen years later , that is still the only time in men s tennis history when the no1 ranking has come down to the final match of the yearend championships that s a surprise considering the historical heavyweights federer , djokovic and rafael nadal who have traded blows and shared the grand slam loot and no1 spot for the past decade what s happened is that these guys have kind of taken turns having monster years , gilbert said but no one has had an allconquering year in 2014 , with four different grand slam champions djokovic , nadal and two interlopers in stan wawrinka and marin cilic but federer , who has won more tour matches than any man this year , still has an opportunity to become the first man since in 1982 to finish the year at no1 without winning a grand slam singles title during the year and federer s opportunity would be quite a bit better if djokovic had not swept to the paris masters 1000 title last weekend in his first tournament since the birth of his first child on oct 21 with federer losing in the quarterfinals in paris to milos raonic , djokovic was able to mold his shaky lead in the points race into something more consequential he is now guaranteed 9 , 860 points for 2014 even if he wins no matches in london federer stands at 8 , 700 points with a maximum of 1 , 500 available in london to an undefeated champion and a maximum of 225 more available to federer when he and the swiss team play the davis cup final in france later this month the bottom line heading to london is this if djokovic wins his three roundrobin matches , he will clinch the yearend no1 ranking for the third time in four years there are other formulas that could solve the problem for him , too meanwhile , the bottom line for federer is that he can ill afford to lose any match , and he finds himself in a prickly fourman group in london that includes raonic , kei nishikori and andy murray , who has homecrowd support and plenty of ambition after a year that has been frustrating by his standards can roger win all these matches \? sure he can , said paul annacone , federer s former coach , but when you look at the group and all the possibilities , it s a big ask , a very big ask i think what the great players want is for it to be on their racket , for it to be up to them and for novak , it s up to him , and that s great for novak the yearend championships began awarding atp ranking points in 1990 but there were still races to the wire before that , none longer than john mcenroe s duel with ivan lendl in 1983 , when mcenroe only regained the top spot on dec 12 that was the latest date of a change in no1 since the rankings began in 1973 but lisbon in 2000 had the tightest and best finish at the yearend championships , which was then called the tennis masters cup safin did what he could after being eliminated by agassi , urging sampras on before he faced kuerten in the semifinals but kuerten foiled safin s plans , beating sampras in three sets and then upsetting agassi in the first indoor final of his career this is the happiest day of my life , kuerten said , which was quite a statement from a man who had won the 1997 while ranked no66 in the world and staying in a twostar hotel back in 1995 , sampras and agassi had duked it out at the top for most of the season , playing in bookend grand slam finals , with agassi winning the australian open and sampras the but agassi ended up withdrawing from the yearend championships in frankfurt with a lingering pectoral injury and sampras ended up winning enough matches \( two in the roundrobin phase \) to supplant agassi and finish no1 by less than 100 points gilbert said he had tried to talk agassi into going to frankfurt in 2001 , agassi was again in contention , making the trip from the united states to sydney shortly after the birth of his and steffi graf s first child obviously novak has handled it pretty well so far , but you never know how just becoming a father is going to affect a player , said darren cahill , who was then coaching lleyton hewitt and was soon to begin coaching agassi when i saw andre in sydney , he looked disheveled it looked like he had jumped off the plane and had n't had any sleep for a couple of weeks hewitt , with support from his fellow australians , swept his roundrobin matches beating agassi along the way to guarantee that he would become the youngest man to finish no1 , at 20 years and 10 months he went on to win the tournament agassi also dueled with hewitt in 2002 , when the championships moved to shanghai , but he faltered again in the roundrobin phase hewitt finished off his final season at no1 andy roddick then held off federer and juan carlos ferrero in houston in 2003 roddick heard the news that he had clinched the top ranking while at a mexican restaurant and in those days before widespread wifi and smartphones followed the progress of agassi s roundrobin match with ferrero through a telephone connection with a friend in the stadium the next day , roddick lost a roundrobin match to rainer sch ttler but got the consolation prize of the trophy awarded to the yearend no1 in the rankings race , you can lose and still end up on top but the yearend event does n't necessarily decide the final order for now , davis cup still awards ranking points i find it disappointing that you can have a yearend championships where you are not definitively announcing your yearend no1 , cahill said if djokovic , against the odds , falters in london , this year s race could be decided at the davis cup final in lille , france , where those 225 available points could prove precious indeed to federer
el paso it is early on a wednesday afternoon , and most of the schoolchildren have been called to their buses from his spot in right field beneath the woofdeck , close to the stand that sells nachos in a dog dish for 10 jeff francoeur has been roasting in the blistering desert heat the day before , francoeur and his teammates on the class aaa el paso chihuahuas , the newest entry in the pacific coast league , had woken at 5 am in tacoma , wash , for a connecting flight to phoenix mechanical problems delayed their departure for hours the parent team , the , was also in phoenix , preparing for a game with the alas , none of the chihuahuas were called away from the airport by the time the team landed in el paso , it was just hours before a night game , which the chihuahuas lost they had an 11 am start the next day and quickly fell far behind when a rally went nowhere in the bottom of the seventh inning , francoeur bounded out to the mound he had done this five times already four without allowing a run but this was purely a lark francoeur was dogtired , you might say , and just one of his 17 pitches broke 76 miles per hour he walked a batter , hit another and then fell behind , 30 , before a popout and a linedrive double play saved him francoeur celebrated this unlikely triumph by beaming and raising his black chihuahuas cap to the sky , even though the only figure still seated in the sunbaked box seats was chico , the mascot a 204 average last season landed francoeur here , but he might as well have fun while climbing back he s an authentic little boy , said pat murphy , the chihuahuas' manager the little kid that s good for everybody to have is still in him that s what makes it special being around him every day francoeur , 30 , is an outfielder who pitches for fun , and to save the chihuahuas' bullpen but his inning on wednesday , when he survived despite hardly even trying , illustrates a timeless truth about baseball the game s set up on this side , el paso pitcher jason lane said so it s like , play the numbers you 're already set up to win lane , 37 , beat those odds often enough to last six seasons as a major league outfielder , hitting 241 on the night the houston astros clinched their only trip to the world series , in 2005 , lane hit a home run and caught the final out in right field that baseball got away from him in the postgame chaos , and soon , too , did lane s hitting career his average slipped to 201 in 2006 and 175 the next season since then he has toiled for seven organizations and two independent teams without returning to the majors i look at the rosters and look at the birthdays and go , sheesh , there s no one else left from the '70s , much less the early '80s , lane said so i do n't look at that but i feel like the age thing is a nonissue before lane s senior season at southern california , in 1998 , his coach told him his best chance to be drafted would be as a pitcher lane , who preferred hitting , was crestfallen at the thought of a fullscale conversion the next day he broke his pitching thumb in the field there went the pitching plan lane , a lefthander , recovered in time to win the final game of the college world series in relief , but he had hit well enough to be drafted for his bat he mostly forgot about pitching , mopping up here and there until a game in 2011 , with toronto s class aaa team , when he caught the attention of kevin towers , the diamondbacks' general manager , who was there to see his team s prospects when towers ran the padres , in 2007 , he had acquired lane down the stretch but would not tender him a contract after the season , beginning his downward spiral into minor league oblivion this time , though , towers saw enough in one inning to offer lane a job on the spot i grabbed him after the game and said , hey , you 're a sixyear free agent at the end of the year i 'd like to bring you to camp , but not as a hitter , as a pitcher , towers said he was like 89 to 91 , good slider i thought he could get bigleague hitters out lane has not done that yet but he is as close as he has ever been , with a 54 record and a 436 earned run average in 11 starts for the chihuahuas josh byrnes , the padres' general manager , said lane had put himself in position to be considered if a need arose in san diego the years of hitting , lane said , prepared him for this role he formally began his conversion at 35 and said he took inspiration from jamie moyer , who pitched until he was 49 like moyer , lane is not overpowering , averaging only about four strikeouts per nine innings he relies largely on guile and typically sits between murphy and the pitching coach , mike cather , during games , acting as a de facto bench coach typically when you get a converted position player , a lot of times he s just throwing , said cather , a former atlanta braves reliever jason pitches that s the remarkable thing he has a better feel for what he s trying to do out there than , i would say , most minor leaguers and a lot of major leaguers , too lane said he never stopped believing he could hit , and he takes batting practice with the chihuahuas' everyday players he pinchhits often and was hitting 407 \( 11 for 27 \) through saturday essentially , lane functions as a 26th man a starting pitcher one day , a pinchhitter outfielder the next four a decade ago , brooks kieschnick served as a twoway player for milwaukee , but pitched in relief few have attempted it since i'm actually kind of intrigued by it , byrnes said to have a guy whose defined role might be a little bit of both , no one s really done that since kieschnick that might be a valuable way to use a roster spot for a guy who can handle it it s definitely something that s crossed our mind lane said he still considered himself a major leaguer , simply plowing ahead until some team sees him the same way if the call ever comes , though , it will be like a rebirth , and much more meaningful than his first promotion in 2002 i think about this a lot , and in my mind , 100 percent it would be way more , lane said i feel like i have so much unfinished business i 've never gotten close to reaching the potential of what i thought i could do up there then again , lane has already achieved much more than most minor leaguers ever will that is the thing about baseball careers however successful they are , few players leave the game without wishing , or believing , they could have done more with eight and a half years in the majors plus a sports illustrated cover at 21 , a world series appearance with the texas rangers and more than 25 million in salaries francoeur understands what he has done his plight elicits no sympathy in his new clubhouse i was bitter for a little bit , said francoeur , who had not begun a season in the minors since 2005 but , dude , do you think any of those guys in there feel bad for me \? in truth , his teammates love him released by the cleveland indians in spring training , francoeur quickly became the mark for an elaborate prank orchestrated by his manager the chihuahuas convinced francoeur that a teammate , jorge reyes , was deaf francoeur , a trusting soul , never suspected a thing at one point , reyes , a pitcher , nearly blew his cover during a mound conference with the catcher but francoeur said he did not notice he was checking on a basketball score with fans in the rightfield stands and never looked toward the mound we were going over ways to break it to him , and some were just too much , so we came up with the idea to make a movie , show him the movie and we 'll record his reaction , first baseman cody decker said then once we got his reaction , it was so great decker s masterpiece , on jeff ears , has been viewed more than 12 million times on youtube another veteran might have been furious , but francoeur was so impressed he bought steak dinners for the team the next night after a slow start , he was hitting 278 with nine homers through saturday , and believes he can help a major league team , especially against lefthanders he is essentially trying out for everyone , because his contract allows him to leave if another team tells the padres it wants him in the majors in the minors , francoeur makes 15 , 000 a month and eats a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the clubhouse , where dues are 13 per day , compared with 70 in the majors and while his major league managers resisted his pleas to pitch , fearful he would overdo it , francoeur has murphy s blessing to use an arm that , like lane s , could someday extend his career francoeur s mound debut , on april 20 , was the first time he pitched competitively since striking out the final batter to win the georgia state championship for parkview high school in 2002 in five and a third innings over six appearances , he has allowed four hits and three earned runs , with three walks and four strikeouts besides a fastball that has reached 91 mph , francoeur has a slider that looks sharp on video \( it is , cather said but do n't tell him that \) he has poor mechanics , he acknowledged , but those could be fixed if he tried say something happens , francoeur said i 've talked to my wife about it i absolutely would give it a go , pitching , before i got out of baseball because one thing about me , i 've always had one of the best arms in baseball , and it s very accurate i throw strikes i 'd love to it would be fun francoeur plays cards before games with lane , whose career as a position player ended at 30 , francoeur s age now he cannot imagine lasting seven more years in the minors i might be up in new york , doing pregame postgame , he said but for now the game still pulls him francoeur and his wife , catie , became parents last july , after years of difficulty he missed his family while playing for the san francisco giants , and said he felt burned out when he questioned his commitment again in april , he said , catie gave him two options stop feeling sorry for yourself or come home for good he stayed with el paso pitching is an enticing backup plan , and francoeur can see , in lane , a model for persistence and savvy but he is not ready to put his bats away if he has to be a chihuahua , he is going to enjoy it if i keep hitting like this , francoeur said , laughing , i 've got a chance to go to the futures game !
at 417 , the are off to the worst 21game start in their history losers of seven consecutive games , and 16 of their last 18 , the knicks entered saturday with only a twogame lead in the atlantic division over the philadelphia 76ers , who have been accused of losing on purpose unfortunately for the knicks , they are , in theory , doing their best to win the early speculation centered on how long it would take the knicks to adjust to coach derek fisher s introduction of the triangle offense but the knicks are allowing 110 points per 100 possessions , the fourthworst mark in the nba , so whatever offense the team runs might not matter it s early , knicks forward quincy acy said after friday s lastsecond loss to the charlotte hornets new offense , new coaching staff , everything we are still trying to figure it out and grow together as a team on the court although the knicks could improve , they could also continue to flounder , especially if carmelo anthony s knee or back problems cause him to miss extended time the situation raises the question what is the current knicks' competition for worst team in franchise history \? the 20012 crew , which broke the franchise s 15season playoff streak a 109 start was scuttled when coach jeff van gundy unexpectedly resigned and a roster of bigname veterans like latrell sprewell , allan houston , mark jackson and the frequently injured marcus camby went 2043 the rest of the way under don chaney the late 1950s and early 1960s squads , which turned a perennial playoff contender into an nba laughingstock after carl braun , a hometown hero and former knicks star , failed as a coach , the knicks handed the reins to eddie donovan in 196162 that was one of the most exciting seasons in league history , with oscar robertson of the cincinnati royals averaging a tripledouble for the season and wilt chamberlain of the philadelphia warriors averaging 50 points a game the most notable aspect of the knicks' season was allowing chamberlain to score a record 100 points in a game only three nba coaches on the sideline for as many games as donovan , who guided the knicks for four seasons and 278 games , have produced a worse winning percentage than his 302 the 198485 team , which had one superstar , bernard king , and 12 other players , none of whom had a leagueaverage player efficiency rating the one thing those knicks did win was the nba s first draft lottery after finishing 2458 , though conspiracy theorists have come up with endless ways in which david stern , then the commissioner , could have rigged the lottery to give the knicks the top pick , patrick ewing the isiah thomasera knicks , who seemed to reach the apogee of misery with the 2006 news conference to announce the trade for steve francis , a flashy but somewhat unproductive point guard francis sat on a podium with coach larry brown and thomas , then the president for basketball operations thomas was the only one who looked happy the other two probably wondered how francis would mesh with stephon marbury , the team s other flashy but somewhat unproductive point guard francis' addition did not help much , as the knicks finished 2359 in 20056 the next season , with thomas as coach , the knicks improved to 3349 , but they were back to 2359 in 20078 using basketballreference s advanced statistic simple rating system , which assigns a value to a team based on its point differential and strength of schedule , the thomasled 20078 knicks were the worst in franchise history at minus 655 that team was so bad that knicks ownership finally gave up on thomas in phil jackson s first full season running the front office , the current knicks have an srs of minus 709 they have plenty of time to make things right , but it is unlikely that anyone thought jackson could make thomas s roster bungling seem a little less bad even for a short time
well , a major and venerable american brand has gone and announced that \( gmo s \) cheerios is gmofree ! and will soon be labeled not made with genetically modified ingredients do we care \? should we \? is this a cynical marketing ploy or a huge deal or both \? \( it certainly is n't neither \) without question this could be the start of something big that it has value to cheerios and to is also undoubtedly true the question is whether it matters to the rest of us it does but that does n't mean it s a good thing first , let s get this straight taking the gmo s out of cheerios is only a little bit harder than taking them out of oatmeal , and cheerios are , essentially , oats \( well , hyperprocessed oats \) they also contain small amounts of cornstarch and sugar , so its parent company , general mills , has done little more than source nongmo cornstarch and cane rather than beet sugar to use in production \( there are gmo beets , and almost all corn and soybeans grown in the united states use gmo seeds , whose products find their way into most processed foods \) this is what they 've done for years , where products with gmo s are almost universally labeled as such but it s not as if general mills which was among the funders of the opposition to gmolabeling efforts in california and washington has made a principled decision , or has suddenly seen some kind of light \( other varieties of cheerios , such as apple cinnamon and multi grain , will continue to be made with ingredients containing gmo s , including corn , corn syrup , beet sugar and others \) it could simply be that the company saw an opportunity to appease part of its market , and to test whether a minimal effort could lead to a labeling opportunity that would boost sales as would , say , a highfiber or cholesterolreduction notice but the label is only meaningless in terms of cheerios' content my guess is that general mills is right the gmofree label will appeal to consumers who , for whatever reasons justified or not would rather buy a gmofree product increased sales might come at the expense of other cheerios products , but then again they might come at the expense of competitors' cereals that ca n't brag about their purity \( let s remember that few , if any , healthsavvy breakfasteating people would make cheerios a frequent choice in any case even if they are easy for toddlers to nibble on \) all of this makes the announcement significant , because if it works , others will follow suit and farmers could easily make the switch back to nongmo seeds \( more are beginning to , as the benefits of gmo seeds are increasingly outweighed by their costs \) , and processed food companies are or at least should be agnostic as to whether corn , for example , was grown with conventional or gmo seeds should we care \? yes much of the controversy over gmo s is being fought between those with a vested interest in their success and those who are willing to overstate the problems with the technology producing seeds containing gmo s is a valid scientific technique the problem is that the benefits have accrued more to the seeds' producers than to farmers \( who are spending many times more for seeds than they were previously \) or consumers \( who ca n't possibly tell the source of refined products in their processed foods \) or to the environment there s an argument that gmo seeds increase yields and keep food costs down , but it s not a convincing one there are three real issues here , and none of them is about whether there are teeny tiny gmo ingredients in our food one is that gmo seeds have arguably done more harm than good , by making traditional farming not only here but internationally and by retarding progress in combating weeds and bugs ecologically in industrial farming still , eliminating gmo s would not do much to remedy what s wrong with industrial agriculture that s going to require a hard look at crop rotation , chemical applications and monoculture in general another issue , and i 've written about this before , is transparency increasingly , people want to know how and with what their food is being produced \( are in favor of gmo labeling \) some of this may be for the wrong reason fear of eating foods produced with gmo seeds \( about half the population believes gmo s to be unsafe \) but the argument for labeling and transparency goes way beyond gmo s , and any labeling that provides more information should be seen as a victory for people who care about food quality this brings us to the third issue , one about which i'm not happy if opportunistic marketers like those at general mills can cash in by making insignificant changes in their products that lead to significant marketing benefits , what happens to people who 've actually put work into making their products significantly cleaner that is , organic \? once you have an organic label , you are forbidden to put not made with genetically modified ingredients on your package that s theoretically understood , as are more important benefits , like antibiotic and pesticidefree but thanks to the waytooloud gmo screaming match , my guess is that it s easier to market food using a meaningless gmofree label than an organic label that s not a cheery thought
washington the chairman of the board of trustees of the corcoran gallery of art , which after years of financial struggle is seeking legal permission to dissolve itself into the national gallery of art , testified in court here on tuesday that the 145yearold museum had essentially lost its ability to attract donors and could not remain a standalone institution you can lead a philanthropist to water , but you ca n't make him drink , the official , harry f hopper iii , a venture capitalist and collector , said under sometimes sharp questioning by a lawyer representing opponents to the merger , who argue that the museum has been mismanaged but with a change of leadership could hoist itself out of its financial slide he became board chairman in 2009 , a few years after the collapse of a capital campaign to build a 170 million museum addition , designed by frank gehry after the plan fell apart , some of the wealthier trustees left the board , and corcoran officials say the difficulty of raising money intensified you have to make the whole proposition attractive to donors , mr hopper , who has championed the merger with the national gallery , added this month judge robert d okun of the district of columbia superior court gave the plan s opponents an unexpected chance to make their case that the museum could be saved intact the plan , under which the national gallery and george washington university would absorb the corcoran and its college , has been presented by officials of the three institutions as the only way to keep the heart of the corcoran s collection intact and to preserve its legacy and so the officials are seeking court permission to alter the 1869 deed of the gallery s founder , william corcoran , who gave his collection and money for the perpetual establishment of a public gallery and museum the opponents current corcoran students and employees who say they could be harmed by the merger plan contend that if it is enacted , the gallery would survive as little more than a name and that its landmark beauxarts building near the white house would no longer function as a museum in court papers they have argued that the board should not be given permission to dismantle one of the country s oldest museums simply because , they contend , trustees have done little to save it in court on tuesday , john w f chesley , a lawyer for the opponents , asked judge okun to rule on the evidence that had been presented over only two days of hearings , saying that the other side had not made a convincing case that the corcoran could not continue in its current state we have a showing of inconvenience and no more , mr chesley said but judge okun declined to rule before hearing more evidence , including further testimony on wednesday from mr hopper lawyers for the opposition , trying to show a lack of financial commitment by trustees , pointed out that he had donated only 3 , 000 to the museum in 2010 , during his second year as chairman , though he has donated 100 , 000 or slightly more in other years during his tenure in some respects the case echoes that of the barnes foundation , created in a philadelphia suburb in 1922 by albert c barnes that foundation , also in financial trouble , waged a long court battle to override the wishes of barnes , who stipulated that none of the collection could be lent , sold or moved but the foundation prevailed and transferred the works to a new building in downtown philadelphia in the corcoran s case , the most important parts of the collection would go to the national gallery works that it could not accommodate would be dispersed to other museums , with a preference for keeping them in washington

in movable outfield walls the trust standing against the rightcenterfield fence as a razorsharp sun peered over the top of on tuesday only 30degree temperatures argued strongly against baseball general manager unveiled the team s latest attempt to win more games than it loses at season s end , the team s analysts carefully studied home run trajectories and decided to move in this fence by as much as 11 feet alderson offered a flurry of statistics to show that the mets' right fielder , , would have hit nine more home runs last season with closer fences and the mets would have hit more home runs than their opponents to this particular sector of the ballpark but but speaking as a lifelong fan , i can attest that the mets do this a lot , reducing you to a stammer this seems counterintuitive to you \? alderson said to a reporter he sounded puzzled our assumption is that this will not adversely affect our pitching look , i love analysisspeak as much as the next baseball geek , all that iso , wins above replacement and ops patter statistical analysis can peel back the game s secrets like skin off an onion by definition , however , the number of home runs that opposing teams hit to a particular spot in a particular outfield in a particular city is a variable that changes from month to month and year to year then there s the question of trying to breathe life into the career of granderson , who will be 34 in march age offers relentless erosions what if his higharcing fly balls if i were rude i would call last season s version glorified popups fall a few feet short next year \? will alderson again wave his hands and bring in the fences \? and what if michael cuddyer , the 35yearold injuryprone outfielder whom the mets just signed to play the outfield for two years for 21 million , hits a few too many balls that bounce off the leftfield fence instead of going over it \? what is the e mc divided by flushing bay humidity and adjusted by cuddyer s birth date that will revive him \? none of the teams that journeyed to the playoffs last season featured two corner outfielders as old as cuddyer and granderson i have no doubt that they are , as alderson insists , good clubhouse guys \( note for a couple of million dollars , i guarantee i will be the greatest clubhouse guy in the history of mets clubhouse guys , including handing out marshmallows at team campfires during west coast trips \) i harbor no doubt that when healthy , and playing in the thin air in colorado , cuddyer positively raked two seasons ago , he led the league in batting average , although he was helped greatly by an unusually high batting average on those balls in play but the calendar and health problems conspire to toss up a flapping flag of warning cuddyer lost 108 games to injury in 2014 he lost 25 games in 2013 and he lost 58 games in 2012 that s 191 games in three years the trend line is daunting combine that with the fact that , as baseball prospectus notes , he does not field well and is best limited to a bottomoftheorder hitter and , well did i mention that the mets moved in the fences after the 2011 season , when they won 77 games and lost 85 \? the next year they were 7488 did i note the mets' analysis showed that jason bay was uniquely suited to hit in \? what s perplexing is that the mets give signs of hewing to an organizational philosophy they have drafted strong young arms and young hitters and the coming seasons offer some reasons for hope if the team s type a potential ace matt harvey is healthy and strides to the mound next march , the mets' top pitchers harvey , the rookie of the year jacob degrom and zack wheeler could offer as fine a hardtossing young threesome as any in baseball their bullpen is loaded with young fireballers first baseman lucas duda hit 30 home runs and knocked in 92 runs the young catcher travis d'arnaud gave signs of being a hitter juan lagares , a quiet , muscular center fielder who runs like the wind , has a preternatural feeling for where baseballs will land \( the mets closed out last season on a september hot streak , although you really should allow that gremlin of doubt who is knocking on your door to step into the foyer the gremlin could offer this counterpoint the mets began winning only when they fell irrevocably out of the race mediocre teams do that sometimes \) doing the math suggests the mets should examine their spending habits they keep up the pretense of being a smallmarket team that happens to play in the biggest market in the united states in fact , they are spending 15 million to 16 million per annum on granderson , 85 million on cuddyer in 2015 and , last year , spent 725 million on chris young , who hit not at all for the mets put those contracts together and you end up with more than 30 million per year , which would allow you to purchase a terrific outfielder i digress the mets' management can resemble yogis in its insistence on standing baseball management practice on its head alderson suggests that when attendance rises , the team will spend more that is like a nasa administrator arguing that when mars moves closer , americans will go to mars in a recent interview , alderson noted that fans liked home runs we 're talking about creating a little more excitement , he said that s not going to appeal to the baseball purists but we need more than baseball purists to fill the ballpark well , right , except maybe not the san francisco giants last year drew 336 million people to their rollicking ballpark , and no one on that team hit more than 22 home runs the mets , in their glory days , featured pitching and more pitching , scrappy defense and a little bit of hitting dwight gooden with his live snake of a fastball and his lord charles curve and tom seaver with his dirty knee and crackling fastball drew full houses in august i took my sons to citi field i anticipated the usual banquet of cheap scalper tickets in fact , young degrom was on the mound , tossing fire , and the joint was jammed we paid more and sat farther away than anticipated , and had a grand time you want people to fill that handsome little park out there by flushing bay \? here s a thought try winning
charlotte , nc for much of this city s recent history , there has been an unwritten tradition of regular turnover in the mayor s office with a single exception , none of charlotte s mayors since 1977 have held the post for more than four years but an uncommon sequence of events , including a cabinet appointment , an election and a corruption inquiry , has led charlotte to the point where it will soon have its fourth mayor in less than a year patrick d cannon , who was elected in november , after his arrest by federal investigators it is a big thing to have four mayors in one year , said suzanne m leland , a political scientist at the university of north carolina at charlotte who studies urban politics i think it is an extraordinary event it is all the more unexpected in charlotte , a place with a carefully cultivated reputation for its lowdrama political culture where many residents say they are proud of the government that is in place the city council is set to decide monday who will fill the balance of the term of mr cannon , who resigned hours after pleading not guilty to public corruption charges stemming from an undercover investigation that began in 2010 mr cannon , a democrat , had succeeded , who served the remainder of anthony r foxx s term after mr foxx the united states secretary of transportation under charlotte s system of government , mayors , who are elected to twoyear terms , have limited power still , several of mr cannon s predecessors have used the job as a steppingstone to campaigns for higher office , including harvey gantt , who twice ran unsuccessfully for senator against jesse helms , and , north carolina s current governor , who served as charlotte mayor from 1995 to 2009 and although the charlotte mayoralty is in large measure a ceremonial , parttime role , paying 23 , 052 a year , the events of the past week have shaken a city with unceasing ambition and an especially deep sense of civic pride many are angry , , a member of the city council , said when he offered a prayer ahead of a special meeting on monday to map out the way ahead many are sad and many are disappointed the tumult in charlotte is playing out as the city continues its remarkable run of growth , fueled in part by its emergence as a financial hub in 1980 , the city s population stood around 315 , 000 people but from 2000 to 2010 , the population increased 36 percent it has since inched even higher to more than 775 , 000 residents , according to a 2012 census estimate everyone here prides themselves on that charlotte is atypical when it comes to good , clean governance , said john autry , another member of the city council but as residents elected mr cannon last year with 53 percent of the vote , the federal authorities were more than three years into the investigation that would eventually lead to the mayor s sudden departure from power in a court filing , the department of justice said that mr cannon had accepted more than 28 , 000 in bribes from undercover operatives by the time he became mayor that mr cannon , who founded a parking management company here and was first elected to the city council in 1993 , ultimately accepted more than 48 , 000 in cash , along with a trip to las vegas and access to an apartment for eddie romero , who runs a restaurant just north of the bank of america stadium , home to the carolina panthers , the allegations were both unsurprising and unsettling it s not a crippling effect , but it is negative , said mr romero , a lifelong resident of charlotte who said he had harbored misgivings about mr cannon s ethics since they worked together on an event when mr cannon was a member of the city council it s completely new to charlotte it s part of the growing pains at a recreation center in west charlotte , the participants at the longstanding , a 90minute discussion of local issues over free coffee , avoided talk of mr cannon s troubles as a group but after the event , participants said they were anxious about a new mayor any appearance of upheaval , they said , sends a poor signal it s never easy , and it s never good , said millie ruscito , a retired teacher it s a bad message to be sure , charlotte is not the only major american city in a period of political turmoil the mayor of washington , vincent c gray , has been a subject of a corruption inquiry since 2011 related to his 2010 election the new jersey capital , trenton , has an acting mayor since the conviction in february of mayor tony f mack on charges that included extortion and bribery and last october in detroit , where the mayor has only limited authority as the city makes its way through bankruptcy proceedings , a former mayor , kwame m kilpatrick , was sentenced to 28 years in prison after his corruption trial charlotte officials are adamant , though , that the extent of corruption here does not approach levels seen elsewhere mr cannon reportedly said as much himself i'm not one of those chicago or detroit , uh , folk , mr cannon said in one conversation , according to a court document but some people in charlotte fear that the city will resume business as usual too quickly and might bypass the lessons of a rare scandal we do n't want to be detroit , said david j pasek , a charlotte physician who stood outside the government complex on monday with a briefcase , offering a 10 , 000 reward for information about other official misconduct that he believes may have occurred more than a decade ago we want to be a great city great cities do n't cover up corruption great cities get to the bottom of it , learn from mistakes and never do it again what is clear , though , is that charlotte residents are deeply familiar with the pending charges in a series of interviews , residents routinely rattled off details of the criminal complaint against mr cannon a lot of people were really stunned by it , and that s why everyone is so interested in reading the details of it , professor leland said it reads like a bad movie script but it is a script that officials acknowledge has placed the city and its government in an unfamiliar place , from which there is no immediate exit , no matter how speedily mr cannon s successor is chosen it s a little like losing the reputation you 've earned after years of hard work , said , an atlarge member of the city council it s something that we 're going to have to earn back , and it s something that we 're really committed to
paris when iranian militants seized the united states embassy and took dozens of americans hostage on an overcast sunday morning in november 1979 , i assumed it was just a brief antiamerican sitin my main concern , i told my editors at newsweek , was not how dangerous tehran would be it was whether it would still be a story by the time i arrived there from paris the next day i sure got that wrong the iran hostage crisis , as we called it , lasted 444 days and as demonstrated by the last week to iran s choice for its next united nations ambassador , it is not over during the crisis , president jimmy carter froze iran s assets , broke diplomatic relations , changed his reelection strategy and ordered a failed military rescue mission that left eight american servicemen dead the hostage ordeal helped get ronald reagan elected as president ayatollah ruhollah khomeini defied international law , used the crisis to consolidate the power of his islamic revolution and branded the united states the great satan the crisis was also a historic turning point , the first time and certainly not the last that the united states would prove impotent in the face of a revolutionary movement in the islamic world nearly 35 years later , many americans do not remember or have never heard of that dark episode in american diplomatic history it took the 2012 film argo , which dealt with only one chapter of the crisis , to return it to the american consciousness but politically , the hostage crisis has not been forgotten it still has the power to traumatize washington the current diplomatic firestorm is the result of iran s nomination of , a senior political adviser to president hassan rouhani , as ambassador to the united nations on paper , he is just about perfect a fluent french and english speaker with a doctorate in sociology from a prestigious catholic university in belgium and a former ambassador to italy , australia , belgium and the european union mr aboutalebi admits that he had a bit part in the hostage drama he was not part of the takeover of the 27acre embassy compound or even in town when it happened but the hostagetakers lacked foreignlanguage skills , and early in the crisis , he agreed to be an interpreter and translator on a small number of occasions he was 22 at the time in an interview in iran in midmarch , mr aboutalebi said he had been the interpreter for the vatican s special representative when he visited the embassy he added that one or two other times he had done translations into english or french , including interpreting at a news conference two weeks into the hostage crisis when the occupiers decided to release 13 hostages it was based purely on humanitarian motivations , mr aboutalebi said of his involvement there is no evidence that mr aboutalebi served as a regular interpreter or translator or participated in interrogations of the hostages during the crisis , president carter called the hostages victims of terrorism and anarchy so he could be forgiven for seeking vengeance against iran today instead , mr carter has called on the united states to move on those were college students at that time , and i think that they have matured , he said on a recent radio program , adding , it would be inappropriate for the united states to try to block someone that iran wanted to choose but saying no to iran over an ambassadorial choice comes at no political cost in congress , so it was easy for both houses to vote unanimously to prevent mr aboutalebi from entering the united states and on friday , the white house said it would not grant mr aboutalebi a visa , effectively scuttling the nomination it remains unproved whether mr aboutalebi was an acknowledged terrorist , as senator ted cruz , republican of texas , who sponsored the senate bill , branded him , or even a major conspirator in the hostage crisis , as senator charles e schumer , democrat of new york , called him what is true is that the hostage crisis was an improvised affair that evolved over time the leaders of the takeover had , as i had assumed , planned it as a sitin that would last at most a few days even ayatollah khomeini s initial instinct was to liberate the embassy , and it was only when he saw the masses of enthusiastic demonstrators at the front gates that he decided to support the occupation the demands and threats of the hostagetakers and ayatollah khomeini quickly escalated first it was the return of the deposed shah mohammed reza pahlavi , who had been allowed into the united states for medical treatment , then the return of iran s financial assets abroad , including the shah s personal wealth positions further hardened early in the crisis , when the occupiers gave journalists copies of documents found in the embassy stating that at least three of the hostages were cia officers operating under diplomatic cover among the documents they handed us was a copy of the cia station chief s phony belgian passport under an assumed name , with instructions on how to use it that was hard evidence for iran that the embassy was a den of spies that justified the occupation and perhaps criminal trials of the hostages as spies along the way , some of the hostages would be physically and psychologically mistreated , interrogated , put into solitary confinement and subjected to mock executions iranians of all classes and political persuasions argue that , unlike in other violent acts against americans in the name of islam the sept 11 attacks , and bombings in places like kenya , iraq and afghanistan none of the hostages died during their ordeal but put hostages and iran in the same sentence in washington , and even now , it still comes out terrorism washington s decision to deny mr aboutalebi a visa highlights the distrust that still infects the united statesiran relationship iranians complain that the united states has never apologized for orchestrating a cialed coup against iran s popular prime minister , mohammad mossadegh , in 1953 , which restored the shah to the throne in a speech in 2000 , madeleine k albright , then the secretary of state , acknowledged the damage that had been done to iran by the coup , but stopped short of an apology the iranian government has never apologized for the embassy takeover in an interview with cnn shortly after his 1997 election , president mohammad khatami expressed regret that the feelings of the american people had been hurt by the hostage crisis , but went no further iran and the united states are now engaged in multilateral talks aimed at curbing iran s nuclear program but hardliners in both countries are suspicious of a deal , and harsh international economic sanctions against iran have failed to ignite a spirit of good will among iranians for iran , the stakes are high the ambassadorship in new york is iran s most important diplomatic post in the absence of diplomatic relations with washington , the ambassador is the public face of iran for the american people iran has not backed down it has refused to withdraw the nomination and , once the visa was denied , called the white house s decision regrettable last week , foreign minister mohammad javad zarif , who himself won universal respect as iran s ambassador to the united nations , called mr aboutalebi one of our most rational and experienced diplomats and noted that mr aboutalebi had traveled to the united nations in the past without a problem we do not have a replacement for mr aboutalebi , and we will pursue the matter via legal mechanisms anticipated in the united nations , abbas araghchi , a senior foreign ministry official , was quoted as saying on saturday by iran s official irna news agency it is rare for washington to veto a country s choice of ambassador to the united nations , unless the candidate is a national security threat , a terrorist or both in 1984 , for example , the united states rejected the nomination of nora astorga as nicaragua s ambassador to washington because of her role in the 1978 murder of a top general in the rightwing somoza government who had worked with the cia she had lured the general , reynaldo p rez vega , to her bedroom , where sandinista guerrillas slashed his throat the united nations was different , and the united states had no objection when the leftist sandinista government appointed ms astorga ambassador there in 1986
in the carnage of gaza and the middle east , the most unlikely people have stepped forward from their grief to offer moral leadership the family of naftali fraenkel , a 16yearold jewish boy , after the apparent revenge killing of a palestinian boy there is no difference between arab blood and jewish blood murder is murder likewise , , said i am against kidnapping and killing whether jew or arab , who would accept that his son or daughter would be kidnapped and killed \? i call on both sides to stop the bloodshed thus those who have lost the most , who have the greatest reason for revenge , offer the greatest wisdom yet , instead , it is now hardliners on each side who are driving events , in turn empowering hardliners on the other side look , when militants in gaza fire rockets at israel , then israel has a right to respond , but with some proportionality more than 200 gazans have been killed , threequarters of them civilians , one israeli has been killed in any case , israel s longterm interest lies in deescalating , not moving to the ground war it now threatens remember that the trend had been away from gaza rocket strikes last year , , there were far fewer rocket strikes on israel than in any year since hamas took over gaza in 2006 but then , since june , there were the kidnappings and killings , rockets and the kind of mutual escalation that arises when each side thinks that the other understands only violence when missiles are flying , hardliners on each side are ascendant they purport to be defenders of their people , but , in fact , they 've repeatedly demonstrated myopia and taken actions that ultimately created vulnerability and weakness after all , it was israel itself that helped nurture hamas and its predecessors in the 1970s and '80s , a prominent psychiatrist in gaza , warned israel s governor that he was playing with fire by nurturing religious militants according to the book hamas , by beverley miltonedwards and stephen farrell , the governor replied do n't worry , we know how to handle things our enemy today is the plo similar shortsightedness unfolded to the north the israeli invasion of lebanon in 1982 inadvertently helped lead to the rise of its enemy there , hezbollah likewise , it was hamas extremism and violence that undermined israeli moderates and led to the rise of the hardliners who today are bombing gaza israel helped create hamas , and hamas helped created today s israel the only way out in the long run is a twostate peace agreement it s true that one is not achievable now , but the aim should be to take steps that make a peace deal possible in 10 years or 20 years israel could learn a lesson from britain and spain , both of which managed to defeat terrorist challenges that were once seen as insoluble the analogy is imperfect , for rockets were n't falling on london or madrid but spain could have sent troops to quash basque terrorists , and britain could have bulldozed the offices of the ira s political wing in belfast instead , and prime minister margaret thatcher negotiated an agreement in 1985 that was criticized at the time for rewarding terrorists this was painful and controversial , and it was by no means an instant success thatcher said in her memoir that the results were disappointing eventually , this approach proved transformative today , in middle eastern terms , the analog would be a minimalist response , not a maximalist one it would be a halt to settlements , cooperation to bolster mahmoud abbas and other moderate palestinians , and an easing of the economic chokehold on gaza to strengthen businesses there as a check on hamas none of this is easy or certain secretary of state john kerry s suggests that mutual distrust is so great that it may take years to lay the groundwork , so let s get started when the families of a murdered palestinian and a murdered jew each call for humanity toward the other , it s easy to dismiss the plea as na ve , inconsistent with harsh realities on the ground but what we 've actually seen for decades is that aggression on one side boomerangs and leads to aggression on the other in contrast , what has worked albeit not very well and not very quickly , and in different circumstances is the spanish and british approaches of toughminded conciliation and restraint to change the political landscape that s the approach that empowers not the hawks , but rather the fraenkels and the abu khdeirs , so that an impossible peace eventually becomes possible
voters in four states on tuesday supported measures to raise their minimum wages , bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with congress s failure to increase the federal minimum of 725 residents of washington , dc , and oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana , following the lead of colorado and washington state but in florida , a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment , now permitted in 23 states , failed narrowly though a majority of voters approved the measure , the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to pass support for lowwage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states , covering such topics as genetically modified food , the right to bear arms and the right to bait bears in massachusetts , voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling , after heavy spending by gambling interests , and in another lift for workers' rights , they required employers to give employees paid sick leave though it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide , the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down , according to the initiative and referendum institute at the university of southern california the number of citizenled initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an evennumbered year since 1974 , in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballot just as notable , perhaps , is what was not subject to the popular vote amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing , as were measures requiring voter identification though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration states for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration , except in oregon , where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get driver s licenses some ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable democrats , but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party lines i ca n't stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation , said tsedeye gebreselassie , a senior staff lawyer for the national employment law project and the federal minimum wage has been stuck at 725 since 2009 four states alaska , arkansas , nebraska and south dakota passed measures to increase the minimum wage alaska s measure will increase the minimum wage to 975 in 2016 , the arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to 850 by 2017 , nebraska s will rise to 9 by 2016 and south dakota s goes to 850 by a wide margin , illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage , but the vote was nonbinding both advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the oregon and washington , dc , measures the washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use , while oregon s allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home , and up to four plants the manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the state liquor control commission congress may attempt to block washington s vote on marijuana and representative andy harris , a republican from maryland , has already promised to do so but mason tvert , a spokesman for the marijuana policy project , which supports legalization , said , the movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward it s simply a question of how quickly it moves forward voters in alaska also moved to legalize marijuana in florida , where the issue figured in the governor s race , the story was different there , john morgan , a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the democratic challenger , charlie crist , spent 38 million supporting the medical marijuana measure , according to ballotpedia , an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives sheldon adelson , a casino magnate , spent even more , 55 million , opposing it , according to committee filings mr crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls , potentially bolstering his support , while the republican incumbent , rick scott , and former gov jeb bush , also a republican , opposed it support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls , and mr crist lost to mr scott the vast majority of america has not legalized marijuana , so i do n't think it s a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow colorado and washington state , both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012 , said kevin sabet , the head of smart approaches to marijuana , which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug as the negative effects show up , it could start to turn people off another perennial issue , gambling , has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies in massachusetts , a 2011 law for three casinos and one slotmachine parlor , none of which have been built the initiative to repeal the law attracted deeppocketed opposition from the gambling industry , which vastly outspent anticasino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor , which was under construction , had already done so no state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931 , according to clyde w barrow , a political scientist at the university of texaspan american california had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country , pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests , and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice cases the measure failed , as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it together , the two deeppocketed sides raised more than 70 million california s governor , jerry brown , who won reelection tuesday , also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign both measures passed easily one authorizes 71 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought , and the other requires the state to save more in its rainyday fund and to pay down more debt california voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors some hotbutton issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this year s ballots , but in colorado , the group personhood usa backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in colorado s criminal code and wrongfuldeath act the group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law , and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on tuesday in north dakota , voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception but in tennessee , voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to regulate abortion , a power that was denied by a state supreme court decision in 2000 also in washington , voters approved a measure that would expand background checks on all gun sales as well as transfers , including private transactions a second , rival measure that would have prevented the state from expanding checks beyond what federal requirements was trailing
how does it feel when the country for which you ve lost youth , relationships and health wants to get rid of you \? it feels like betrayal if the army is our family , then this is divorce the week of june 22 was a hard one for army captains after announcing in early december that about 20 percent of captains commissioned in 2006 , 2007 and 2008 would receive pink slips this spring , the cuts were finally handed down starting june 23 those who were chosen for the ax \( or , as army officials more tactfully call it , separation \) were given the bad news in a meeting with a senior officer everyone else waited nervously to see whether they would be next the army isn t the only service enduring reductions the air force , navy and marine corps have announced force shaping , too while officers face separation boards or are denied promotions and , therefore , required to exit even more enlisted service members are being downsized instead of being asked to leave after being reviewed , however , they are simply not permitted to reenlist , an action that had been all but guaranteed when the wars were raging while the army stands at about 520 , 000 soldiers today , the pentagon s 2015 budget proposal calls for it to shrink by almost 60 , 000 by 2017 about 1 , 100 army captains in june heard thank you for your service you have until april 1 to exit the army about 500 army majors were to get the same news this week my husband escaped the reduction this time many of my friends husbands and , by extension , my friends themselves , were not so lucky after giving between seven and as many as 17 years of service , these officers and their families are being ordered to leave many of them don t have a backup career plan when they joined the army they , like my husband and me , planned to stay 20 years or more they have watched buddies die , missed anniversaries , first steps and birthdays and now , just like that , it is all over for the entirety of our army service the enemy has been over there , far away in afghanistan or iraq we grew comfortable with the danger of deployments , reassuring ourselves that in a down economy where factoryworking or cubicledwelling civilian friends faced layoffs , we had job security with a steady paycheck on the 1st and 15th of the month , military service felt safe compared to the nightmare of unemployment but it doesn t anymore officer separations have been used throughout american history as a means of controlling the size of the force targeting cuts at certain commissionyear groups is not new when the military didn t need you anymore , it let you go it happened after world war ii , korea and vietnam downsizing is a normal way for the military to recover from war but none of us were around then we don t care that it s all been done before for us it feels fresh , terrifying and even insulting force reductions feel very personal and , after all is said and done , rather arbitrary when the cuts were announced , army officials said that primarily those with poor evaluations or reprimands on their record would be targeted but nothing ever works as seamlessly in real life as on paper those who deserve it are not the only ones who get fired i just don t understand why us , my friend whose spouse was selected for the cuts told me there are so many others who are worse after giving up her blooming career as a counselor to follow her husband to a new duty station , and spending at least 39 months without him during their relationship thanks to training and deployments , she doesn t understand what more they could have done to deserve to stay there is one kind of survivor s guilt when friends and neighbors are arbitrarily cut down by war there is another kind when friends and neighbors are arbitrarily cut down by peace when my friends husbands were killed or seriously injured downrange , i didn t understand why we made it out unscathed but now i feel a sense of survivor s guilt that my spouse has a job while so many others soon won t did they really escape death on the battlefield only to be a casualty of force reductions \? and while my family is safe for now , this won t be the only time the army makes cuts over our heads hangs the cloud of maybe we re next when a job is a way of life and your coworkers are your family , pink slips feel like betrayal after years of combat deployments , training separations , child births while alone and crosscountry moves , we have given so much in the service of our country the military has become the closest family many of us have ever had and now , just like that , some of us are orphans amy bushatz is an army wife , mother and the managing editor of militarycom s spousebuzz blog you can follow her on twitter at
krasnaya polyana , russia there was a skirental shop at the base of the gondola in exchange for 1 , 400 rubles \( about 40 \) and temporary custody of my american driver s license , i got skis , poles , boots and a helmet for the day my olympic credential got me on the gondola , and the next one , and the next one , until there were no more mountains to climb and the view was all downhill through the snowcapped peaks , the black sea was a dark shadow on the horizon i had an hour to kill before i met danny davis and greg bretz , american snowboarders who had agreed to let me ski with them after the halfpipe competition i wove past the downhill course and a slalom training session the slopes were virtually empty i got to our prescribed meeting point at the top of the first gondola it was hot , and i stripped off my jacket and sat in the shade a man approached he wore a backpack that had a tube protruding , and he poured himself a maltylooking beverage there was a bit of foam at the top he took a sip he pointed to it and raised his eyebrows , the international gesture to ask if i wanted a cup , too in broken english , he said that it made him ski better i used two of the three russian words i knew nyet , spasibo no , thank you the last thing i needed at 10 30 in the morning was a beer a woman came along , and the man cheerfully poured her a beverage funny a guy just hands out beers on the slopes in the morning but then she stepped into the cool shade , and i saw steam rising from her cup i looked at her quizzically the woman raised the plastic cup chai , she said i knew another word after all it was tea i turned to the man yes , of course please spasibo krasnaya polyana , russia mikaela shiffrin had , been saluted by the finishline grandstand crowd in a flower ceremony , held a huge news conference before an international gathering of journalists and found time to hug countless teammates , opponents , coaches and friends with her face flushed and her eyes wide , shiffrin was well aware she was living a shining , definitive moment in a young life but as she left the alpine skiing area late friday night and headed out into a new world of celebrity , there was still one little ritual to complete , something shiffrin had been doing after ski races since she was in grade school she wanted to pose for a picture with her parents in visits to the shiffrin home in the last year , i saw dozens of these kinds of snapshots shiffrin with her parents , eileen and jeff , at the bottom of innumerable racecourses in colorado , new hampshire , vermont , maine , utah , canada and europe in the earliest photos , she was half as tall as her parents slowly , in more ways than one , she began to progress in stature but on the night she became the youngest olympic slalom champion , and with the athletic world buzzing over the possibilities of an 18yearold budding ski queen , shiffrin abruptly stopped the whirlwind enveloping her with the slope where she had just made history behind her , shiffrin threw an arm around each parent , handed over a cellphone and smiled for another picture this was important the photo , a twinkling image from the mountains of southern russia late on a friday night , will look good in the family album krasnaya polyana , russia there is a good chance andi langenhan does not remember me but for a few moments early in the olympics , he provided some muchneeded inspiration ill , freezing and questioning my decision to make the trip , i waited for langenhan , a german luger , to walk through the mixed zone , where reporters can speak to the athletes after their races my assignment was to find , and langenhan had missed a medal by 558thousandths of a second , so he was my target many athletes in this situation can barely hide their disappointment and dish out bromides about their respect for those ahead of them langenhan was different he said that he had hoped to win a medal but that he was pleased that he had improved on his fifthplace finish at the vancouver games bouncing with energy , he seemed eager to start training for the 2018 games the little man in my head always says go on , go on , go harder , for sure , langenhan , 29 , said after but i know i can do it all the other guys who are unknown who come to the top 10 can reach a medal for sure , and everybody is getting older and knows what to do it dawned on me that if langenhan could see the bright side in his dispiriting near miss , then i should be able to do the same thanks to langenhan , my stride gained a step , and my gloom lifted sochi , russia yuzuru hanyu had just become the first japanese man to win it was an unlikely victory three years earlier , hanyu had been skating at his home rink in sendai , near the epicenter of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast japan as the ice rumbled and pipes burst , hanyu fled the rink , running outside in his skates , ruining his blades it might have been tempting to ascribe some civic inspiration to his goldmedalwinning performance when the saints won the super bowl after hurricane katrina , it was said in a glow of romanticism to have helped new orleans heal but hanyu , 19 , selfaware beyond his years , was not a man of sentimentality he knew the limits of sport just as he had reached its zenith after his victory , hanyu was solemn instead of celebrative he expressed gratitude to those who had lent his career financial and spiritual support at the same time , he hinted that he felt guilty for leaving home to train in toronto he knew that his victory could not really help anyone recover in sendai he felt helpless , he said , as if he were not making any contributions but now he had a gold medal it was at least a starting point perhaps , hanyu said , there is something i can do going forward sochi , russia gold gets the glory , but sometimes it s the fight for the lesser medals that impresses the most in the finals of the men s 1 , 000meter shorttrack race , two russians , victor ahn and vladimir grigorev , took the lead by the third lap and never lost it sjinkie knegt of the netherlands , who was in last with five laps to go , slipped into third with two laps remaining , but in the crucial final turn of the last lap , he was edged to the outside of the track by sin dawoon of south korea the phrase at the wrong place at the wrong time was never more apt the korean making a late move ! an announcer on a cbc broadcast of the race shouted knegt and sin bumped each other a bit , and then it was a threestride dash to the line just before they crossed , knegt jutted out his right leg and that was the difference a perfectly timed lunge of the foot until that moment , knegt was best known as the skater disqualified from the european championships for making an obscene gesture a kind of doublegun antisalute , if you will behind ahn s back as the two crossed the finished line now , he 'll be remembered for something else being the first athlete from the netherlands to win a medal of any kind in short track at a news conference afterward , knegt beamed , as elated as any thirdplace finisher has ever looked krasnaya polyana , russia there s an old norwegian fairy tale in which a huge , snarling troll challenges a lost little boy to an eating contest they sit down at a table for porridge , and the boy somehow matches the troll spoon for spoon , and then bowl for bowl and then the boy pulls ahead , putting away a bathtub s worth of porridge while the troll struggles to take another bite the boy wins \( and the troll soon dies a gruesome death \) how did he do it \? well , it was a bit of a cheat the boy dumped the porridge into a bottomless bag secretly taped to his stomach but that s not the point the point is , he never seems full he s always hungry , said ole kristian stoltenberg , one of norway s most prominent biathlon commentators and that s bjorndalen at the sochi games , ole einar bjorndalen , , won two gold medals , the 12th and 13th olympic medals of his career if it s possible to strut on crosscountry skis , bjorndalen did as he flew past the competition in race after race , his poles jauntily jutting out behind him like fred astaire s umbrella at 40 , bjorndalen is old enough to be the father of some of the biathletes he dominated in the sochi games benjamin weger , a 24yearold swiss biathlete , remembers the first time he found himself racing against bjorndalen that was really a great feeling to compete with him , he said that moment was so great weger did n't seem too upset at being trounced by his boyhood idol for me , biathlon is bjorndalen , and bjorndalen is biathlon , he said bjorndalen assumed folkhero status so long ago that now , as he enters middle age , even his injuries have assumed a mythic grandeur in 2011 , reports said he hurt his back while he was helping a friend chop firewood in bjorndalen s hometown , simostranda , norway , there s a 10foot bronze statue of him racing on skis king harald v attended the unveiling the statue s dimensions herculean thighs , broad shoulders are generous bjorndalen is surprisingly small , more elfin than titan when he takes the rifle off his back and removes the laurels from his neck , he could pass as a friendly high school gym teacher but bjorndalen is adored like few other winter athletes in sochi , he was one of the few foreigners whom russian fans unequivocally embraced he s so amazing he s so determined , said tiril eckhoff , 23 , a teammate on the norwegian team he s so old , too in this age of tarnished heroes , anyone who wins gold medals into his 40s has to be looked at askance is he doping \? stoltenberg , the norwegian commentator who has long tracked bjorndalen s every race , seemed offended by the question if he tested positive for doping , i would quit my work , stoltenberg said he seemed to mean it the biathlon press corps has shown bjorndalen a reverence that would make world leaders seethe with envy after bjorndalen won his first gold medal of these games , a reporter asked him what amounted to you 're not the type of athlete to give up , are you \? at another news conference , after another gold medal , a reporter wanted to know what it felt like to win more medals than any winter olympian before him bjorndalen sighed your first feeling is tiredness , he said krasnaya polyana , russia the crowd at the downhill skiing event looked cliquey and potentially badtempered , wrapped in flags , drinking beer , wearing inyourface nationalistic costumes , sitting according to country the germans here , the australians there , the norwegians somewhere else , the russians everywhere on television , which homes in on the loud and the extreme , these sorts of crowds come across as jingoistic , even hostile not in person in the stands were a couple who lived in istanbul and a friend who lived in dubai they had converged in sochi for a minicanadian reunion one of them , melanie wrigglesworth , there with her husband , mike , had bought some red felt in an istanbul market and fashioned cat in the hat style hats appliqu d with white maple leaves mike and the third canadian , greg forgrave it was his birthday also wore elton johnesque novelty sunglasses but rather than screaming go away , their outfits had turned them into a threeperson canadian embassy they could barely watch the skiing , so many people came up to admire their costumes , to trade olympic pins with them , to pose for group photographs in the stands , the canadian hats clashing with the other improvised headgear first were some people from switzerland , who were large and dressed in ski helmets , goggles and house of switzerland sweaters and who waved two flags a swiss flag and a flag with a picture of a beer on it then came some norwegians and some americans and then russian after russian after russian none spoke more than a word or two of english but their delight in being there , in being with other people who were having as good a time as they were was impossible to misunderstand
washington in the early scorekeeping of winners and losers in duty , robert m gates s unsparing account of his days as defense secretary , hillary rodham clinton has fared better than either president obama or vice president joseph r biden jr while mr gates wrote that mr obama could be cynical and controlling , and that mr biden had an unerring capacity to be wrong on big issues , mrs clinton was , in his words , smart , idealistic but pragmatic , toughminded , indefatigable , a very valuable colleague , and a superb representative of the united states all over the world between those gushing adjectives , though , mr gates paints a less flattering picture of mrs clinton as secretary of state and not just because of his wellpublicized claim that she confessed to opposing the iraq troop surge for political reasons during the 2008 democratic primaries that disclosure is less interesting than his descriptions of how the white house kept mrs clinton on a short leash throughout her years at the state department from foisting an unwanted deputy on her , and then granting that person enhanced status in administration debates , to shielding an ambassador she regarded as insubordinate , the white house , in mr gates s telling , all but put mrs clinton in a gilded cage the controlling nature of the obama white house , and its determination to take credit for every good thing that happened while giving none to the people in the cabinet departments in the trenches who had actually done the work , offended hillary clinton as much as it did me , mr gates wrote , summing up their shared frustrations at a time when mrs clinton s tenure as secretary of state has come under sharper scrutiny held up against the hyperactive , risktaking style of her successor , john kerry mr gates s memoir will reinforce the perception that mrs clinton was a respected but cautious figure , with a diplomatic record that now seems oddly evanescent mr gates , for example , says nothing about mrs clinton s role in the middle east peace process , where mr kerry is now engaged in a highstakes effort to broker a deal between the israelis and palestinians he says little about her influence in stiffening policy toward iran , after mr obama s offer of engagement , made early in his first term , was rebuffed \( though he credits himself with advocating the sanctions that finally brought iran to the bargaining table \) to the extent that mr gates praises his fellow midwesterner , it is usually for agreeing with him in the debates over how many troops to deploy to afghanistan , mrs clinton faithfully sided with mr gates and the generals against mr biden and the president s political advisers at times , she could be even more hawkish , favoring gen stanley a mcchrystal s recommendation of 40 , 000 troops over mr gates s somewhat more modest proposal when the arab uprisings began toppling autocrats who were also allies , mrs clinton again sided with mr gates , urging the president not to be too hasty in abandoning hosni mubarak in egypt only later , when mr obama was weighing whether to intervene in libya to prevent col muammar elqaddafi from slaughtering civilians in benghazi , did mrs clinton part ways with mr gates , supporting the arguments of samantha power and other aides that the united states should intervene , while mr gates argued against it mr gates made the most of his alliance with mrs clinton , calling her in singapore when she was on a trip with mr obama to urge her to lobby the president for his afghan troop proposal she laughed and said she 'd do her best , mr gates wrote what mrs clinton got out of their partnership is less clear mr gates was an advocate of a greater state department role in afghanistan but he makes it clear that the effort failed , portraying mrs clinton as a frustrated bystander in a turf battle between her special representative and friend , richard c holbrooke , and two powerful white house aides , tom donilon , the national security adviser , and douglas e lute , who coordinated afghanistan policy that battle provides one of the most revealing glimpses into mrs clinton s predicament mr gates describes how she vented in a white house meeting about the ambassador to afghanistan , karl w eikenberry , who she said was defying her and taking his orders from people in the west wing lashing out against the meddling by the white house and the national security staff , mr gates quoted her warning the president s aides i 'll turn it all over to you and wash my hands of it i 'll not be held accountable for something i ca n't manage because of white house and nss interference despite her demand that mr eikenberry and mr lute be moved out , which mr gates seconded , neither one was it had become clear that eikenberry and lute , whatever their shortcomings , were under an umbrella of protection at the white house , mr gates wrote while mr gates described mrs clinton as unfireable because of her star status a status he said he , too , enjoyed his account tells of a white house that was unafraid to clip her wings early on , mr gates wrote that the president made a reluctant james b steinberg deputy secretary of state after mr obama acceded to his request to be a member of the principals committee , which gave him a seat at the table with mrs clinton at national security council meetings mr steinberg had served in the administration of president bill clinton , but he was not mrs clinton s first choice as deputy , and mr gates recalled him staking out different positions than the secretary of state , sometimes in front of the president i suspect , he wrote dryly , the arrangement caused hillary more than a little frustration \( mrs clinton s aides have said that she and mr steinberg got along well \) beyond these bureaucratic feuds , mr gates s memoir drives home a larger truth about mrs clinton s years at the state department she served during a time when the great issues of the day were about ending wars , not embarking on daring diplomatic gambits mr gates credits mrs clinton with mending relationships frayed after the tumultuous presidency of his former boss , george w bush \( who nevertheless comes in for less criticism than mr obama \) and he praises her for standing up to china when it was bullying its neighbors over territorial disputes in the south china sea for all his kind words , though , mrs clinton emerges less as a power player than his loyal wingwoman shortly before he stepped down , mr gates recounted mr obama s final effort to persuade him to stay longer , quoting the president as saying that mrs clinton had told him , you 're not leaning hard enough on bob in mr gates s telling , that was never a problem the white house had with mrs clinton
sana , yemen the kidnappers pulled up in a pickup truck outside the taj barbershop in an upscale neighborhood here in the yemeni capital one held an ak47 assault rifle and the other carried a as the men went inside , nearby shopkeepers heard shots then a foreigner tall , with the physique of a body builder , and holding a black gun was seen standing over one of the mortally wounded attackers in the doorway of the barbershop , witnesses said the foreigner kicked an automatic weapon out of the man s hands , looked right and left down the street , jumped into a nearby sport utility vehicle and drove away those new details emerged saturday about a shooting last month in which the obama administration from the united states embassy killed two armed yemenis who were trying to kidnap them from the barbershop while much about the encounter remains unclear , a yemeni official said saturday that the two yemeni assailants were part of a cell linked to al qaeda that had planned and executed several attacks on foreigners in the country whether by design or chance , the official said , the americans had apparently disrupted a kidnapping ring that government officials blame for killing a frenchman last week , kidnapping a dutch couple last year , trying to assassinate a german diplomat last month , and attacking the central prison here in february , freeing 19 inmates the shooting at the barbershop led yemeni authorities to the group s leader , wael abdullah alwaeli , said an interior ministry spokesman , col mohamed alqaidi yemeni that they killed mr waeli last wednesday during a shootout in the capital the state department announced wednesday that it had closed its embassy here to the public because of security concerns the shooting on april 24 has opened a rare window into american clandestine operations in , a major battleground against what counterterrorism officials say is al qaeda s most dangerous regional affiliate and it has emerged as a potential source of embarrassment for yemen s president , abdu rabbu mansour hadi , whose government helped conceal the american role in the shooting , allowing the two officers to leave yemen quietly a few days after the shooting yemeni officials have not yet publicly acknowledged that americans were responsible for killing the attackers , referring only to foreigners in washington , spokesmen for the state department , pentagon and cia declined on saturday to provide any details about the shooting american officials , however , said they strongly suspected that the qaeda branch in yemen was behind the attempted kidnapping , and that embassy personnel were targets of other planned kidnappings the state department acknowledged friday only that two embassy officers had shot and killed two assailants who tried to kidnap them , and that the shooting was under investigation two american officials identified the men as a special operations commando and a cia officer the killings have an echo of a 2011 case in which a cia security officer , raymond a davis , was jailed for weeks after killing two pakistanis on a crowded street in lahore on saturday , witnesses and yemeni officials gave a slightly different account of the shooting , saying that only one of the foreigners had actually fired his weapon , striking each of the attackers at least twice colonel qaidi said the kidnappers had pretended to be police officers the foreigner who fired at them was carrying a licensed weapon , he said , and first shot the yemeni man carrying the ak47 before shooting his partner shopkeepers and witnesses said the police questioned the barbershop staff for a few hours , and took away the owner , but he was later released individuals who witnesses believed were relatives of the gunmen came to collect their bodies , argued with the police , and were arrested later that night , officers returned , and took a copy of a recording made by a video camera at the barbershop , shopkeepers and witnesses said , and then destroyed the equipment the shop has been closed since the shooting , though it was opened briefly so the employees could clean it , other shopkeepers said many other questions remain unanswered about what exactly the two americans were doing at a barbershop on a street frequented by westerners in the yemeni capital , apparently with no security detail they just went out for haircut \? it seems a little strange to me , said gregory d johnsen , a yemen scholar and author of the last refuge yemen , al qaeda and america s war in arabia who visited sana five weeks ago a former united states embassy official said the barbershop had been popular with embassy staff members when many lived outside the embassy compound but most folks have gotten their hair cut at the embassy for quite some time now , the former official said , as the requirements to move into town are just too onerous to warrant that level of effort to get a haircut mr johnsen said security was so tight in the capital that embassy personnel he met had to get permission from washington to leave the walled compound but the armed american officers may have been operating under different rules in the past two years , since mr hadi s election , the pentagon has gradually increased its presence in yemen , sending about 50 special operations troops to train yemeni counterterrorism and security forces , and a like number of commandos to help identify and target qaeda suspects for drone strikes , according to american officials while strikes carried out by cia drones operating from a secret base in southern saudi arabia illustrate the bestknown covert program in yemen , the cia also has a significant number of personnel in yemen conducting counterterrorism missions and some training , the officials said the cia has stepped up its cooperation not only with yemen s spy agencies , but also with saudi intelligence , which has deep contacts in its southern neighbor it was saudi intelligence , for instance , that helped by al qaeda s regional affiliate here , , in october 2010 to pack explosives in printer cartridges and load them on cargo planes bound for chicago and it was a saudi double agent who infiltrated the qaeda offshoot to in 2012 to blow up a united statesbound airliner the obama administration s counterterrorism strategy in yemen aims to help president hadi overhaul his nation s military to combat the qaeda franchise in its strongholds in large parts of the country s south and it calls for the united states and yemen to work together to kill or capture about two dozen of al qaeda s most dangerous operatives , who are focused on attacking america and its interests this approach adheres to the white house s global counterterrorism strategy in the wake of the wars in iraq and afghanistan to employ small numbers of special operations troops , cia paramilitary teams and drones against elements of al qaeda that are committed to striking the united states , while arming and advising indigenous security forces to tackle costlier longterm counterinsurgency campaigns whether the strategy will work in yemen is still unclear in yemen , there are a variety of different factions , each with enough weapons and men , but none have enough guns or men to impose their will on everyone else , said mr johnsen so there is lots of maneuvering behind the scenes
rome on a recent evening , two volunteer doctors and a handful of medical students moved gingerly around a dimly lit room , examining dozens of newly arrived migrants from the horn of africa the medics treated blotchy arms , legs and feet symptoms of scabies lighting the infected areas with a smartphone app nearby , a pediatrician listened to the chests of newborns and toddlers the impromptu clinic was set up in an abandoned building on the outskirts of rome , colloquially known as salaam palace , where hundreds of migrants have squatted for years europe s quickening migration crisis has now left the place overflowing , with most new arrivals relegated to an underground parking garage , sleeping on soiled mattresses on the ground the overcrowding of salaam palace is a crisis within a larger , nationwide emergency set off by a fresh surge of since the beginning of the year more already than in all of 2013 the inflow has severely taxed italy s resources , spawning miniature salaam palaces in cities across the country as asylum seekers are distributed to refugee centers , hotels and makeshift dormitories with summer approaching , the numbers are only expected to spike the system is already creaking under the strain a national news program reported last week that one group of migrants , recent arrivals at italy s heel in puglia , had been bused to the capital and left abandoned and disoriented in a parking lot even in rome , salaam palace is just one of several similar squats , though certainly the most famous , or infamous italy s president called the building a national shame in a televised address in 2012 salaam palace is so well known , that migrants from hundreds of miles make it their destination the mayor of rome visited last year and pledged help pope francis has quietly sent his own almoner , or alms giver , to put his social message into action , sending workers to unclog sewers and donating a prefabricated hut with showers but those who live here say each round of attention , and each wave of newcomers , merely underscores the persistence of all that is not working with italy s immigration policies , and those of europe more generally this year , populist parties have gained ground across europe by playing on fears of immigration , shifting the debate toward themes of economic competition and the social cost for a traditionbound continent that seems more inclined than ever to wall itself off from global forces , whether corporate competition , digital innovation or the movements of people none of that , however , has stemmed the tide of people breaching europe s defenses over the last weekend alone , the italian authorities recovered three bodies and rescued more than 5 , 400 people , most crossing the mediterranean from libya in overcrowded , rickety boats run by people smugglers they know about salaam , this place is known in africa , and before they even leave libya they think about coming here , said bahar abdalla , from sudan , a longtime resident we wo n't send anyone away but we 're worried this ca n't continue few migrants voluntarily ask for asylum in italy , but rather hope to continue to northern europe , making salaam palace a way station for some , and a permanent home for others forced to remain in the country as a result of the european union s socalled dublin regulation intended to discourage multiple asylum claims , the rule calls for asylum seekers to request refugee status in the first member state they enter human rights workers say the rule does not provide efficient or effective protection for the migrants , and puts a disproportionate burden on the european countries that border the mediterranean last october , after several hundred , the southernmost italian point in the mediterranean , the european union stepped up naval patrols , both to control the flow of migrants and to assist vessels in distress critics say the patrols have only increased the incentives for migrants to risk the dangerous passage more and more keep coming now they arrive still covered in sea salt , said donatella d'angelo , a doctor with the volunteer group cittadini del mondo , or citizens of the world , which has run the weekly medical clinic at salaam palace for eight years in the past at least they 'd get fed and cleaned in reception centers on lampedusa this crisis has been dumped onto the occupied centers , rather than being handled at a national and european level , on the part of those who have the power to actually do something , she said despairing of waiting for help from the government and local authorities , dr d'angelo recently made a public appeal for soap , towels , sheets , clothing and pharmaceuticals many charities and institutions responded , she said , including an elementary school that took up a collection of toothbrushes and toothpaste on a recent evening , dozens of young men several in their teens and women and children of varying ages lined up patiently to receive toiletries and clothing from volunteers , assisted by longtime residents as it is , it s not easy to live here , we had to set them up in the garage on mattresses because it s all we had to offer , said ibrahim abdala , a volunteer originally from darfur , in sudan , who has lived in the building for six years one young eritrean woman smiled shyly and nodded when rosana patti , a volunteer who normally teaches weekly italian classes here , pulled a pink tshirt from a cardboard box of donated women s clothes if things do n't calm down , ms patti said , i do n't know how we can keep up critics of italy s system say that assistance to asylum seekers and refugees is fragmented among too many different agencies that do not coordinate among themselves without more effective programs to integrate the migrants into society , the situation is a bomb waiting to explode , said christopher hein , director of the italian refugee council first assistance to new migrants is still lacking it s true that we 're unprepared , but we 're unprepared because there is no planning , said daniela di capua , director of the state s asylum protection agency italy keeps trying to keep up with an emergency that has become ordinary rome , like other cities still feeling the strains of europe s long economic crisis , has struggled to provide assistance , and much of the care for those here rests with volunteers there is some evidence that the recent influx has caused the italian authorities to take note the health authorities met with various groups in recent weeks to discuss the situation officials have pledged to refurbish the medical clinic and build a deposit for donated items the international committee of the red cross set up an aid van , and one nonprofit organization has promised to clean up the garage and donate camp beds mayor ignazio marino of rome visited salaam palace last september with a delegation from city hall and also promised help but for those who have lived in salaam palace for years , the assurances of official assistance have little coinage marino came , he spoke with us , but in the end it s as if he had n't come , nothing has changed , it s just getting worse , said ali , a resident of salaam palace who declined to give his last name the residents have protested countless times for help , to no avail , he said governments

a few other magicians and illusionists have made television shows by using their skills to punk the unsuspecting , but none have worked the gimmick better than michael carbonaro does in which begins on thursday night on trutv not only is the guy genial and witty on camera \( not all magicians are \) , but he also has a collection of tricks and illusions that smartly capture this cultural moment , when the pace of technological innovation leaves us unsure of what is possible and what is n't for instance , , posing as a shipping clerk , opens a container the size and shape of a pizza box and , to the astonishment of a customer , pulls out a bowling ball that s how they 're packing them now , he explains to her , deadpan they invert the air he is utterly convincing it makes them lighter for shipping , he adds , selling it perfectly playing the same character , he tells another customer about a new vortex shipping service the item being shipped instantly materializes at its destination then he demonstrates it mr carbonaro , who worked these types of bits in on the tonight show with jay leno , is droll and comfortable , but what makes it all succeed are the reactions of his targets there is bafflement , but it s mixed with a 21stcentury credulity i did n't know technology had advanced that far , you can sense them thinking , perhaps just as they did the first time they were introduced to skype or or any of the countless other miracles of our age
sana , yemen the old man still rises at 5 30 am , as he did during the three decades he ruled this tumultuous country he does some physical therapy to help his scarred body recover from the 2011 bomb blast that nearly killed him he reads the papers and then , sitting in a gazebo in a highwalled compound that rivals the presidential palace , he begins receiving the endless tide of visitors who still treat him as if he were the most powerful man in yemen ali abdullah saleh is a rare figure in the arab world , or anywhere else an autocrat overthrown by popular revolt who nonetheless remains in his country , unmolested nominally , mr saleh , 71 , is a retired statesman writing his memoirs he was granted immunity from prosecution under the terms of the deal that removed him from power in 2012 but his many enemies say he still plays a powerful and poisonous role here they accuse him of arranging terrorist attacks and some of the assassinations of more than 150 highranking officers and political figures over the past two years even the current president , abdu rabbu mansour hadi , who was mr saleh s deputy for 18 years , has accused him of orchestrating the attacks on oil and power lines that scourge yemen s economy and cast an aura of incompetence on the new administration diplomats at the united nations have accused elements of the former regime of playing an obstructive role , and have even hinted at possible sanctions on the former president mr saleh , a gruff man with a proud scowl stamped permanently on his face , showed no emotion when those accusations were repeated these people are not confident of their power , and still consider themselves as employees of ali abdullah saleh , he said during an interview in the vast courtyard of his compound they think anything that happens in the country , large or small , must have been done by ali abdullah saleh he always speaks of himself in the third person around him , aides shuffle , offering papers and phones , and wellwishers and political figures hover in the middle distance , waiting their turn one man stands waiting with an umbrella , ready to protect mr saleh s skin from the sun whenever he steps away from the shade of the gazebo it is impossible to know whether the darker accusations against him are true , diplomats and analysts say investigations of political violence are scant and inconclusive in yemen , and the government is still crippled by corruption there are plenty of other possible culprits , including al qaeda s regional branch , though it is an easy scapegoat there is no doubt that mr saleh still wields enormous power here he remains the leader of mr hadi s own political party , to the president s chagrin many in the military are still loyal to him his residence in the capital is barricaded for blocks in every direction by concrete barriers and soldiers born into a peasant family , mr saleh had little formal education , and he rose through the ranks of the army after yemeni officers overthrew the old religious monarchy in 1962 when he came to power in 1978 , few expected he would last the previous two presidents had been assassinated but he outmaneuvered his opponents , and in 1990 he unified the north with south yemen , previously a soviet client state by the time the arab uprisings started in 2010 , yemen was convulsed with insurgencies and discontent , and mr saleh s hold was weakening recently , he has signaled an alliance of sorts with the houthis , an insurgent group in the far northwest with which he fought a bitter , intermittent war for years the houthis have grown into a broad national political movement since 2011 , fueled largely by a hatred of islah , the yemeni islamist party that is the equivalent of the muslim brotherhood mr saleh hates them both , but he clearly also resents mr hadi , who frequently disparages him few accuse mr saleh of scheming to return to power himself although his mind seems clear enough , he suffered serious injuries in the bombing in 2011 , which killed six guards and maimed many others \( it is still not clear who carried it out \) he moves slowly and haltingly , and the skin on his hands and face is patchy from burns he underwent the latest of numerous operations in january instead , many critics say he aspires to clear a path for his family in the years before his fall , mr saleh appeared to be grooming his son , ahmed ali saleh , much as a former leader of egypt , hosni mubarak , prepared his son gamal for a succession mr mubarak was overthrown , and his son was imprisoned on corruption charges mr saleh installed dozens of other relatives in powerful positions , especially in the military and security services most have now been purged , but none have been prosecuted when mr saleh was asked about these ambitions for his son , his scratchy voice rose in protest i did not want that for him then , much less now , he said he went on to deride the opponents who still seem so focused on him it is not enough for them that i have left power , he said they think they will not rule yemen until i also leave the country , and die it is entirely possible that mr saleh s son or nephews could eventually inherit his mantle many yemenis speak admiringly of egypt s military chief , field marshal abdulfattah elsisi , who forced that country s elected president , mohamed morsi , from power last summer and is now poised to become egypt s next president he has been uncompromising in his dealings with the muslim brotherhood , using lethal force to silence its members and having it declared a terrorist organization despite the democratic yearnings stirred by yemen s popular uprising in 2011 , many people here are frustrated with the country s chaotic politics and view mr hadi as irresolute yemen s major islamist party , islah , has wide popularity , but like the muslim brotherhood in egypt , it is widely distrusted , partly because of its compromises during mr saleh s rule in theory , yemen is healing its political fractures through a process of accommodation , not a return to brittle strongmen last month was the conclusion of the national dialogue conference , a 10month exercise in group political therapy that was called for in the united nationsbrokered deal that removed mr saleh the conference involved endless , often fractious encounters among 565 people representing yemen s many political parties and social classes , tribal sheikhs , religious leaders , businessmen , women and revolutionary youth but as the talks dragged on in the movenpick hotel , on a hill overlooking sana , the rest of yemen fell deeper into chaos tribal rebellions broke out in the south , and al qaeda increased the tempo of its attacks , despite the continuing american campaign of drone strikes in december , an in sana killed 52 , leading many yemenis to conclude that al qaeda had penetrated the army and security services mr saleh offered muted praise of the national dialogue there was a good effort , he said if there is political will , i think there could be some implementation but when asked about the arab uprisings of 2011 , mr saleh returned to the theme that helped keep him and other arab rulers in power for so long fear of the alternative the arab spring was born dead , he said it came in the shadow of hard circumstances in the middle east , and it became a weapon in the hands of the islamic movements
derek fisher has yet to coach a regularseason game for the , but he can sense a distinct advantage to his new occupation my body feels great , that s for sure , said fisher , who , as an nba point guard for 18 seasons , absorbed his share of contact maybe not as much sleep , but my body feels absolutely wonderful fisher patrolled the small parcel of property in front of the home bench at madison square garden on monday when the knicks fell to the , 120107 , in a preseason game fisher was opposed by none other than , late of brooklyn , and perhaps there was a bit of symbolism if not exactly symmetry as two former point guards went about the business of coaching their new teams for fisher , it is all still brand new for the first time , he is responsible for shuffling lineups and seeking chemistry and managing minutes as the knicks build toward their opener against the chicago bulls on oct 29 on monday , the job meant experimenting with amar'e stoudemire at the center position it also meant coping with the unexpected absence of jose calderon , who strained his right calf in the first quarter and did not return and while fisher has constantly emphasized defense , the knicks played little of it the bucks shot 597 percent from the field and were 12 of 24 \( 50 percent \) from 3point range carmelo anthony scored 24 points for the knicks kidd has taken charge of a young roster after his muchpublicized \( and muchcriticized \) departure last june from the nets he was surrounded by a flotilla of tape recorders before the game when fisher poked his head inside the new media scrum to give him a fist bump kidd playfully described fisher as a rookie coach he has all the ingredients to be one of the best coaches in the league , given time , kidd said it was kidd , of course , who jumped straight from playing to coaching in 2013 a move that fisher said was groundbreaking and may have played a role in his landing with the knicks kidd s lone season with the nets was on the verge of tumultuous , but it also set a precedent it kind of opens everybody s minds to what is possible , fisher said i think prior to jason kind of cutting that cloth , most of us thought you have to maybe coach for five or 10 or 15 years as an assistant , or be a scout or a video coordinator or some other combination before you get a chance to become a head coach for now , fisher and kidd are outliers in a league that has long valued the twin concepts of gaining experience and paying dues and in some ways , the spotlight on fisher will be brighter because of missteps that kidd made last season the seasonopening suspension , the spilled soda incident , the demotion of the assistant coach lawrence frank fisher said he sought advice from kidd over the summer kidd , fisher said , told him to stay true to himself and to exercise patience some things are unpredictable injuries , kidd said you ca n't protect against them you just have to go to the next guy , and if you 're not a deep team , it can put you in a bad situation with the knicks , there are sure to be challenges big and small for starters , fisher will need to figure out what to do at power forward , with four players conceivably vying for a starting job stoudemire , andrea bargnani , jason smith and quincy acy bargnani , who missed monday s game with a strained hamstring , and stoudemire , who declared himself to be feeling like a teenager again , are both in contract years smith , an offseason acquisition , has shown a deft outside touch , and fisher has said that he likes acy s energy and rebounding tenacity no matter what fisher decides to do , there is the potential for hurt feelings as someone who has been in similar situations as a player , fisher said he knew he would need to be transparent i think players always appreciate whether or not they like the information that you 're communicating with them and letting them know what s going on , so that they can try to do something about it , he said there are some things that you just have to accept as being part of this league , and being on this team , he added above all , fisher has emphasized team his favorite word of the preseason he wants his players to make sacrifices for the greater good managing a cast of multimillionaires is not the easiest task , and kidd had his share of obstacles in his lone season with the nets then again , he did not always help himself fisher appears to be putting in the hours , having made a clean break from his playing career he still lifts weights , he said , but no longer plays not even the occasional game of pickup the tasks he does now strategizing , planning and organizing are things he always thought about as a player , with one key difference now , he said , it s my job
london neymar is broken cristiano ronaldo left without a trace luis su rez disgraced himself and , according to his own grandfather , the real has not shown up at this world cup with all due respect to antonio cuccitini , messi s grandfather , he is missing something rather special the old man is looking for the boyish messi who , with the smile of a child , danced with the ball around clusters of opponents for fun leo does n't run like he used to , grandpa cuccitini told canal 3 tv during an interview in the family s hometown of rosario , argentina , on messi s 27th birthday just over a week ago in spain , he was electric , he would leave 22 players feeling dizzy now , i do n't know what is wrong maybe none of us know what is happening with messi it is true that there is currently less joy in his play , yet there appears at the same time to be a transformation , a sublimation of skills for the benefit of the team messi at this tournament is n't the impish , irresistible scamp darting in and out of crowded penalty boxes to score seemingly at will , as he did earlier in his career some argentine dubbed him la pulga the flea for the way the diminutive boy flitted and flickered with his ball , daring opponents to stop him , all the while mesmerizing them the flea is morphing into a catalyst he wears the armband as a captain , making others play around him the comparison with winning , or helping argentina to win the 1986 world cup , weighs heavily upon messi maradona , argentina s idol of the 1986 world cup , and pel , brazil s threetime world cup winner , are watching in the stands maybe they know what messi is going through and understand that while he may seem less electric , this change could push his national team to the title that everyone says he needs to compare with his idols this transformation in messi s style on the field is not at all unappealing two things happened to change him , as a player and a person , over the past two years he became a father late in 2012 when his son thiago was born and he spent much of the following season recovering from a series of muscle problems in his thighs and knees that time spent cut off from his obsession with the ball time fretting about his body s ability to tolerate all those twists and turns appears to have made him rethink his game instead of always trying to thrill the crowds , taking on any number of defenders and with his verve and his swerve evading their heavy shoes , he would slow down instead of relying upon xavi hern ndez and andr s iniesta , with their wonderful , selfless passing ability , he would take his turn to drop deeper into midfield , and perhaps supply such passes to others in front of him , or on the wings the dazzler becomes the provider messi still has scored four of argentina s eight goals in this tournament thus far and marvelous , solo goals they have been as well , grabbing victories out of stalemates in tight and absorbing contests but the run and the pass allowing ngel di mar a to strike the lastditch winner against switzerland last week was still messi s goal because he sucked in three defenders toward him , created the space and then freed di mar a to score a similar thing unlocked belgium in saturday s quarterfinal there was the messi magic , the beguiling way that he tricked kevin de bruyne and marouane fellaini in the same move , and instigated the opening from which gonzalo higua n handsomely stroked the game winner , for his first goal of the tournament it is just an ordinary team , said belgium s coach , marc wilmots , of the argentines argentina s coach , alejandro sabella , countered , he is water in the desert when the terrain is dry , he gives us that breath of fresh air every time he has the ball , sabella , a former midfield player , added it is not only about scoring goals he draws three or four opponents he endangers the opponent the influence that he has is decisive look back to that moment when messi sparked the goal against belgium there was the turn to his left to shepherd the ball from de bruyne , followed immediately by a pirouette , still with the ball under his control , that made the tall , angular fellaini look as awkward as a giraffe trying to put a hoof onto a mouse there messi is , and then he , and his precious ball , are gone a mirage , perhaps , but with a purpose in the same game , during which messi was reported to be quiet , he delivered a 40yard pass that dissected the massed belgians and then curved , with the slight backspin he applied , into the path of a teammate on the run there is more happening to messi in every performance than meets the eye his grandfather is also concerned , as many in argentina must be , about the vomiting on the field earlier in the tournament that was not satisfactorily explained as the pressure messi is under on saturday , he equaled maradona s total of 91 caps for their country messi s 42 goals in that time eclipses maradona s 34 , but unless he brings home the trophy that maradona did 28 years ago from mexico , messi knows he will suffer by comparison with his compatriot , and his idol but since messi could not , or would not , express in words what he displays in skills , we have to translate for him he appears to me to be deliberately changing his style , at times even disengaging from the team in order to lead it the boy we so admired is growing into a responsible adult , a leader

hayden , ind erin stoner , a teacher at hayden elementary school , gave the information to her sixthgrade class straight , without sugarcoating it or tiptoeing around it one of the students' classmates , calvin clark , had just sustained a severe head injury during a football game she felt obliged to tell them the truth calvin hurt his brain , and he s has n't woken up yet , she recalled telling them two days after the injury , which happened early this month i'm not going to tell you that he 'll be ok because i do n't know that it s too early to say one of their vocabulary words was responsive , so mrs stoner talked about what that meant , as in , calvin is not responsive eleven and 12yearolds asked questions like when will he be back \? and will he remember me \? she wanted to provide answers but could say only , i just do n't know , guys she explained that calvin , who is 11 , had an operation to repair a burst blood vessel in his brain and that the first 72 hours were crucial the children counted the minutes it s been 36 hours halfway ! one said to her , and mrs stoner responded with an assuring nod but , really , it s been as if all of jennings county has been holding its breath as it watches the clock s hands tick by maybe people in jennings , in southeastern indiana , knew that 2014 had been particularly deadly for football players , and that the deaths of nine high school players had been attributed directly to football maybe they did n't know perhaps they had long thought that those tragedies happened in other towns , to other families , to other children but this time , without warning , the issue of football safety has landed directly on their doorstep , in this closeknit community where many people know one another and work on farms or in factories it was a marvel to see how people in this county of about 28 , 500 including the 6 , 728 in north vernon , calvin s hometown and the big city here rallied to help one of their own within hours of his injury , dozens of people on facebook had made their profile picture a growling panther \( jennings county high school s mascot \) with the words praying for calvin tshirts with praying for calvin on the front and calvin s last name and football number , 48 , on the back , were sold for 10 as a fundraiser to help pay for his medical expenses bake sales for calvin soup dinners for calvin silent auctions for calvin his classmates came up with the saying calvinstrong , which soon popped up around the county , on tshirts , on signs posted along the streets and even on badges that were made and worn by first graders the principal at hayden elementary , brent comer , said he did n't even think the children knew what a hashtag meant , but they thought it was cool , so he decided to order rubber bracelets with the phrase calvinstrong , to sell for 2 all of it , again , to raise money for calvin s family we can moan and groan and be angry and be sad about what happened , but the family wants us to give them positive vibes , so that s exactly what we 're trying to give them , said mr comer , who drove with mrs stoner to try to see calvin right after his injury we consider calvin one of our family , and none of us are thinking about why it happened , or about football , right now not yet , at least so many other places in the united states recently have gone through situations like this small towns larger cities parts of the country that live for football and parts that do n't about a month ago , in the span of one week , it was troy , ala , then rolesville , nc , then wading river , ny all places where high school players died after sustaining playing football how many more communities will be forced to consider , in the harshest , most personal manner possible , how safe it is for their children to play football \? it s jennings county s turn to ponder it maybe not now , but soon these days here , there has n't been much time for introspection calvin was injured on nov 1 , when he and his county youth travel team played in an endofseason allstar tournament in columbus , about 30 miles from here the event lasted two days , with doubleheaders each day several witnesses said that calvin , a wispy running back , was horse collared in the first of two games that saturday , which meant that an opposing player had pulled him down by grabbing the inside of his shoulder pads one of his teammates and classmates , raul ruiz , told me calvin was later blindsided by one tackle , got up from the ground , then dropped his head and grabbed his face mask , appearing distraught he was in the huddle crying , but when the coach said , you , ok \? ' he just said , yeah , ' and kept playing , tough little guy , said raul , who is 12 and considers himself calvin s best friend after getting tackled during the second game that first day , calvin walked to the sideline and told the coach and his father that he felt sick moments later , he collapsed , unresponsive , several witnesses said an ambulance brought him to a hospital , and then he was airlifted to riley hospital for children , in indianapolis , where he had brain surgery and stayed raul s mother , laura white , was at the game and said all the parents congregated near the field , shocked at what had just unfolded even some top experts in the subject of sports concussions ca n't agree whether children as young as 11 , like calvin , or 12 , like raul , should play tackle football some experts now say children younger than 14 should n't play because their brains are still developing and their neck muscles are n't yet strong enough to stabilize their heads during tackles to me , that makes sense better safe than sorry , right \? others contend that a new focus on player safety has made youth football safer than ever , and that there is no reason to keep children from tackle football until there is scientific proof that it is more dangerous than , say , riding a bike raul , for one , said he was not thinking about quitting the game at 5 feet 5 and 200 pounds , he thinks his size will protect him i'm not scared , but i'm scared for my smaller teammates , he said he acknowledged , though , that just before calvin was injured , he almost pulled himself out of the game because his head was hurting from one tackle his headache lasted for two days , he said scientists are still in the early stages of gathering data on young players a trailblazing 2012 study showed that seven players age 7 and 8 sustained some hits as forceful as the more severe ones on the college level calvin s immediate family declined a request to be interviewed , but other family members and there are a lot of them here , as calvin s mother has nine brothers and sisters said the episode would most likely give calvin s parents pause as to whether their three boys should continue to play football one aunt , who did n't want her name used out of respect for calvin s parents , said she had thought about pulling her young son from the sport , but had not he really loves it , she said and besides , he s really good at it and wants to play division i football calvin s injury ca n't be pinned on x or y , his aunt said , and even his doctors ca n't say definitively why his blood vessel burst that day , she said two weeks after calvin got hurt , the fundraisers are still going strong at the high school girls' basketball team s season opener on friday night , 254 was raised for the family in a 5050 raffle more than 1 , 500 praying for calvin tshirts have been sold mr comer , calvin s principal , last week drove more than two and a half hours roundtrip to bloomington to pick up a signed football and a gameworn jersey with calvin s name sewn on the back , a gift to calvin from indiana university football coach kevin wilson raul , calvin s buddy , said he often thought about whether calvin will recognize him the next time they meet , which makes him tearyeyed and mrs stoner continued to give her class honest updates on friday , she shared the good news that calvin was breathing on his own but you still ca n't visit him , and he s still not talking , she told them it still will be a long road , and he might have to learn how to do things like eat and read again , so we all have to be here for him of course , his classmates will be there and this community will be there in jennings county , it s ingrained in people to watch out for one another the introspection about football s safety issues will come , in time for now , calvin s desk remains as he left it his classmates have vowed not to touch the top of it until he returns the reality is that the clock s hands might tick for weeks , or months , before calvin is back , perhaps so long from now that the superman water cup atop his desk gathers dust it s a reminder that the legions of children who play football though tucked inside their helmet and pads of superhero armor are nowhere near invincible
when masahiro tanaka left yankee stadium in the second inning of friday night s game , he could not have known how important his job would be saturday as is customary for many starting pitchers , tanaka headed home early friday , to his manhattan apartment , to ensure he had a good night s rest but that was not the case for most of his teammates friday s game lasted 14 innings and ended at 12 58 am saturday , resulting in a jarring loss for the it ended so late that preston claiborne and john ryan murphy slept on couches in a conference room near the yankees' clubhouse , but tanaka said he stayed up to watch the entire demoralizing affair when he arrived back at the stadium saturday , his task was clear the yankees had used every one of their relief pitchers the night before , and many were not available not only did the yankees need a good outing from tanaka , they required a long one i was aware i needed to go as long as i could , tanaka said through an interpreter there is uncertainty surrounding the yankees' rotation these days , and tanaka has emerged as their most dependable starter with c c sabathia and hiroki kuroda struggling in recent starts , and ivan nova and michael pineda injured , the yankees could not afford to lose with tanaka on the mound the early indications were not particularly good tanaka gave up three runs in his first four innings , and the yankees' offense remained in a state of slumber but tanaka , pitching without his best stuff , stabilized himself , and mark teixeira hit a tworun homer to ignite the offense and so , on a day in which a win seemed as vital as any could in early may , the yankees fought back to beat the , 93 i think it s important , manager joe girardi said i also think it s really impressive i think this is a resilient group and a veteran group that understands you 're going to have games like last night s it s extremely frustrating when it happens , but every day is a new day the win helped wipe away the sting of the previous night , when the yankees could not push across a run in extra innings it also extended tanaka s regularseason unbeaten streak to 40 starts \( and one relief appearance \) dating to aug 19 , 2012 during that stretch , he is 320 in the regular season , including four wins at the end of 2012 with the rakuten golden eagles , a 240 mark last season and a 40 record in his rookie season with the yankees the streak does not include his game 6 loss in the japan series in october , his only defeat during that time tanaka allowed three runs and eight hits over seven innings , recorded five strikeouts and walked none he threw 113 pitches and gave up home runs to desmond jennings in the first inning and wil myers in the fourth , both with the bases empty tanaka criticized his stuff , saying his signature splitfinger fastball felt more like a changeup , without the dive it usually displays he can attack you in a lot of different ways , catcher brian mccann said he s not just a onepitch pitcher even when he does n't have his best stuff , he s able to maneuver through lineups mccann also said that david dejesus s single that glanced off tanaka s left ankle in the second inning was bothering tanaka more than he let on he got smoked , mccann said but tanaka found a way to fight through and was aided by not only teixeira , but also jacoby ellsbury , who continued to be the yankees' most valuable player ellsbury had three hits , including a double , and drove in a run , scored two more runs and stole a base he raised his batting average to 346 and is off to as good a start as he could have pictured after signing a sevenyear , 153 million deal with the yankees , or at least it would seem that way i could have pictured doing better , ellsbury said we 're playing well as a team , and it s a good environment i'm just happy to come to the yard each and every day and put on a yankee uniform but there s always room for improvement teixeira s home run , his fourth in the past five games , cut the yankees' deficit to 32 ellsbury s double in the fifth tied the score , and kelly johnson gave the yankees the lead for good with his fourth home run girardi said that had the score remained close , he would have sent tanaka back out in the eighth , at least to pitch to matt joyce but the yankees scored twice in the seventh , so dellin betances pitched the eighth claiborne , who woke up on the couch only hours before , took care of the ninth i set my alarm for 9 and got a good seven hours of sleep , claiborne said so did tanaka and after five extra innings of frustration on friday and a sluggish start saturday , the yankees' bats finally woke up , too inside pitch the yankees called up alfredo aceves from class aaa scranton wilkesbarre on saturday and designated chris leroux , who surrendered five runs in the top of the 14th inning on friday , for assignment
the latest legal challenge to texas' sweeping abortion measures in a federal courthouse in austin last week , as federal judges around the country grapple with the question of how far states can go in regulating abortion a question that seems likely to end up in the united states supreme court the crux of the matter is what the supreme court meant when that abortion regulations may not impose an undue burden on women seeking an abortion some judges have held that as long as a law has a rational basis and does not prevent most women from getting an abortion , it does not impose an undue burden but others have suggested that laws making abortions harder to get must have a good reason for doing so states can protect unborn life , but they have to do so in ways that reason with women , rather than just interpose obstacles to women , said reva siegel , a yale law school professor who has written about roe v wade these laws do interpose obstacles , and they claim to do so on women s behalf , and the question is whether that purpose is a legitimate one the texas lawsuit , brought by abortion providers , challenged the requirement that abortion facilities meet the standards for ambulatory surgical centers those standards , which include hallway widths and pipelines for anesthesia , have proven too expensive for most texas clinics to meet fewer than 10 clinics in the state and none in the lower rio grande valley or west texas will remain open if the provision goes into effect sept 1 , as scheduled united states district judge lee yeakel , who is hearing the texas case , is expected to rule before then supporters say the regulations will make abortions safer critics argue that they have no medical justification and are intended to limit abortions by forcing clinics to close the has dropped to fewer than 20 from 41 in 2012 because of regulations that went into effect in november requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals judge yeakel , which mirrors laws passed in several other states in recent years , in october , but the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit and  in the fifth circuit , judge edith h jones held that since there was at least a rational basis for believing the law would make abortions safer , and it would not prevent a large fraction of women in the state from getting an abortion , it did not impose an undue burden she dismissed the argument that greater driving distances alone could violate that standard other courts have taken a different view in december , judge richard a posner of the seventh circuit about a wisconsin admittingprivileges law that the undue burden test required judges to weigh the state s justification for the law against its effects on women seeking abortions the feebler the medical grounds , the likelier the burden , even if slight , to be undue' in the sense of disproportionate or gratuitous , judge posner wrote it is not a matter of the number of women likely to be affected judge myron h thompson of united states district court followed a similar approach in on monday , holding that the restrictions did not serve enough of a medical purpose to justify shutting down three of the state s five clinics the wisconsin case is still in progress , but if the seventh circuit strikes down that law , the disagreement among appeals courts would create a circuit split , said john robertson , a law professor at the university of texas at austin \( the university is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune \) that might persuade the supreme court , which tends to avoid abortion cases , to settle the issue
kiev , ukraine an eerie calm and a light mist shrouded president s sprawling residential compound just outside the capital on saturday morning as street fighters from the center of kiev made their way inside , gingerly passing a wroughtiron gate and cautioning one another about booby traps and snipers they found none of either but discovered instead a world surely just as surreal as the charred wasteland of barricades and debris on the occupied central plaza that has been their home for months it was a vista of bizarre and whimsical attractions on a grand scale , a panorama of waste and inexplicable taste they saw about a halfdozen large residences of various styles , a private zoo with rare breeds of goats , a coop for pheasants from asia , a golf course , a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship , with the name galleon on the stern one man in the 31st lviv hundred , the small band of antigovernment militants that took control of the compound , hung a ukrainian flag on a lamp post a few dozen others walked about , seemingly dazed by what was happening some raised their clubs , pipes and bats into the air and yelled , glory to ! and glory to its heroes ! whether it was the toppling of ferdinand marcos of the philippines or of col muammar elqaddafi of libya , the breaching of the presidential palace gates is a milestone of a revolution but kiev on saturday was unusual in one sense there was no sacking the opposition unit that took control of the president s complex , called mezhigorye , kept it intact , at least for now on saturday , the president fled , and the presidential guard melted away but members of the lvivbased hundred , who had repeatedly confronted mr yanukovych s security forces on the streets , posted guards around his residential compound and prevented looting even as swarms of gawking kiev residents strolled through its grounds the reason , the street fighters said , was to preserve evidence of the ousted leader s lavish lifestyle for his prosecution one of the lviv militants walked onto a gazebo ringed with plaster urns , removed his green military helmet and gazed out at the park and the dnieper river another pair , wearing fetid , sootsmeared clothing from the square and carrying baseball bats , walked into an outbuilding , sat in chairs with plush blue and gold upholstery , pulled large yellow drinking glasses from a cabinet and began to photograph one another on their cellphones as if raising toasts we hoped for this but did n't expect it , said one , roman dakus mr dakus had been in kiev at independence square , or maidan as it is known here , off and on for three months , he said it was very , very difficult to stay on the square in the cold at night but we warmed one another with our hearts and our souls people really changed their mindset because of these events , mr dakus added before , people thought , nothing really depends on me' they preferred to say that and to think like that but after this situation , they think differently they believe in their struggle when they are all together within a short time , a crowd gathered outside the gates the street fighters threw them open , and ukrainians , who were arriving by the thousands by early afternoon , flowed into the compound what a nightmare , one man said in disgust , looking at the dining room of mr yanukovych s pirate ship , moored at the river bank , all oak and brass trim the complex was once a modest government site that mr yanukovych turned into a private residence and then expanded , saying acquaintances had built or paid for many amenities previous ukrainian presidents had not lived at the residence the street fighters decided not to open the buildings , saying they would wait for prosecutors and experts on valuable art to arrive and assess their contents autocrats seem to have a propensity for private zoos , and mr yanukovych s palace complex contained multiple enclosures for exotic animals rare pheasants with magnificent , iridescent red tails scratched about in their cages , nervous from the crowds walking past and snapping pictures the labels on the cages identified them as diamond pheasant and japanese longtailed pheasant other cages held dogs , and there were pens for goats and what appeared to be rare breeds of pigs the street fighters also found a heap of ash from burned documents , and used a raft to fish others from where they had been thrown into the river , laying them out carefully to dry the complex extended well over a mile along the river and was immaculately landscaped with hedges , lawns and birch trees , and a golf course of graceful swales , sand traps and pools of crystalline water even as the crowds grew , there was no sign of looting by evening , a vast traffic jam formed on the highway from the capital , and crowds walked along the road s shoulder to see the open palace the grounds filled with ukrainian citizens , awed by what they saw i 've never seen luxury like this , said one man speaking of mr yanukovych , ihor knyazov , a cook , said he could n't stand up and tell the people , i give up' so he just ran away , the coward it s beautiful here , said svetlana gorbenkova , a realtor , as she walked about it s so peaceful but why all this for just one person \? this was all stolen from us it s obvious now how much he stole why did n't he give anything to the people \? when he was running for president , one of his slogans was , i will listen to every one of you' but he did n't listen to any of us
kashgar , china visitors walking through the mudbrick rubble and yawning craters where closepacked houses and bazaars once stood could be forgiven for thinking that the ancient silk road city of kashgar had been irrevocably lost to the wrecking ball a billboard looming over the ruins tries to counter that impression inherit and preserve the historical culture to showcase a brand new kashgar the chinese authorities set out five years ago to modernize kashgar s fabled old city district while promising to preserve its dense casbahlike charms but the results underscore the growing divide between the government and the ethnic minority that lives here the uighurs , a muslim , turkicspeaking people who have chafed at beijing s rule since communist troops took over their traditional homeland in 1949 the region , in china s far west , is now known as xinjiang , a mandarin term meaning new frontier the official narrative of the modernization project justified tearing down 65 , 000 homes and resettling 220 , 000 uighur residents as crucial to improving their lives houses in the old city of kashgar are mostly old and dilapidated , extremely vulnerable to earthquakes and fire , said a 2010 report by xinhua , the state news agency , that was widely republished in the chinese governmentcontrolled media the renovation of the old city zone in kashgar is a project that complied with the wishes of the people , the report claimed but propaganda slogans posted across the old city , like everyone has the responsibility to create peace and security , hint at political tremors in xinjiang that are much more worrying to the chinese government than any natural disaster uighurs have protested discrimination , restrictive religious policies and suppression of uighurlanguage education as people from the han majority have settled in xinjiang by the millions the tensions have spilled over into increasingly violent clashes on saturday , violence spread to a railway station in a distant southwest chinese city , kunming , where a group of and wounded 143 the chinese authorities described the mass slaughter as a premeditated , violent terrorist attack perpetrated by separatists from xinjiang for many uighurs , the demolition of kashgar s old city is a physical symbol of the chinese government s efforts to destroy their cultural identity more than twothirds of the centuriesold houses there have been razed and replaced with new buildings made to look old and equipped with central heating , indoor plumbing and electricity the government pays for building a new house s first floor residents must pay for everything else some residents are pleased even though the neighborhood has changed , we 're much happier with our new house , said a dressmaker who identified herself only as ayesha , standing in her new kitchen though none of the arabesque filigree details of her family s 500yearold residence were preserved , she said , her family incorporated traditional design elements into the new doors and windows it s a lot safer , she added but many of the former residents could not afford what is essentially gentrification by government fiat , and they have not returned to the neighborhood the uighurs who have come back tend to be the wealthier ones , government employees and successful merchants whose economic wellbeing depends on their cooperation with the handominated authorities the rest have been scattered to drab apartment blocks on the city s outskirts , far from their traditional way of life local officials silenced any complaints and introduced a socalled zerotolerance system to keep residents from airing their grievances to higher authorities out of earshot of the tour guides and police minders who invariably follow visiting foreign reporters , some uighurs say the government has shown little interest in preserving the city s architectural heritage at the end of a dusty alley , an aging uighur woman eagerly welcomed visitors into her 300yearold courtyard home built by a wealthy silktrading ancestor , the house has seen better days in the main room , now used for storage , a naked bulb illuminated diamondshaped mosaics of green and white tile , framing recessed antique shelves with foliated arches but the raw logs propping up the ceiling were a more recent addition , installed after construction work by her neighbors caused long cracks in the room s walls officials offered to help finance repairs but refused to replicate the original craftsmanship if it was rebuilt , all the beautiful history would be lost , she said eventually they decided to leave the house in its current condition as a draw for tourists kashgar has been viewed as the jewel of uighur civilization for centuries , a center of trade and islamic learning on the caravan routes linking europe and persia with china marco polo visited in the 13th century today , it is the westernmost sizable city in china , near the borders with tajikistan , kyrgyzstan , afghanistan , pakistan and india beijing gave it the privileged status of a special economic zone in 2010 in the hope that a flood of investment and infrastructure projects would help quell political instability but ethnic tensions in xinjiang have increasingly boiled over into violence , most notably in deadly riots in urumqi , the regional capital , in 2009 clashes over the past year have claimed more than 100 lives , many of them uighurs killed by security forces during what officials describe as terrorist attacks uighur exile groups put the blame for the bloodshed on paramilitary police officers they say have been given the green light to use deadly force against unarmed protesters the first sign that the strife was metastasizing beyond xinjiang appeared in october , when a vehicle carrying three uighurs in beijing and wounded 40 others before bursting into flames the chinese authorities said the attack was the work of the east turkestan islamic movement , a militant uighur group in kashgar , security forces standing guard with guns and shields are a familiar sight they are particularly visible in people s square , which is dominated by a statue of mao waving toward the han area of the city his back is to the demolished uighur quarter what remains of the old city is rapidly being turned into an ethnic theme park , with a 5 admission charge the beijing zhongkun investment group has leased the area from the neighborhood communist party committee and is marketing it as a living uighur folk museum according to xu lin , vice president of the company s kashgar branch , 20 households have signed contracts to open up their homes for tourists , earning around 8 , 300 annually from the sale of food and trinkets now every family wants to join , ms xu said she added that the company hoped the old city might one day be designated a world heritage site by unesco those hopes , though , have crumbled along with the old houses beatrice kaldun , unesco s cultural specialist in beijing , called the redevelopment of kashgar one of the black spots of heritage conservation recalling a mission to kashgar in 2009 to meet officials and inspect the government s construction plans , ms kaldun said she was shocked by the scale of destruction it was like a desert in the city , she said though she made delicate diplomatic requests that the authorities respect local people and building customs , chinese officials used her trip in a propaganda campaign to imply that unesco had endorsed the redevelopment ms kaldun rejected that assertion she likened the razing of the old city to the taliban s in bamian , afghanistan , in 2001 , saying it was too late to save either one nothing can stop this train anymore
geneva fin her final days as the united nations high commissioner for human rights , navi pillay has neither slowed down nor shied away from controversy in midjuly , ms pillay , 72 , a south african , released a report setting out the right to privacy under international law and how this right had been violated by the dangerous habit of mass surveillance among the intelligence agencies of countries including the united states and britain days later , at the , ms pillay called on israel and on hamas , the islamist faction that dominates the gaza strip , to account for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity through indiscriminate attacks on civilians she criticized israel s blockade of gaza and told world powers that they needed to do far more than they have done to end the cycle of violence as members of her staff dig through the resulting avalanche of hate mail from both those who support israel and those who side with the palestinians , ms pillay is preparing to meet members of the united nations security council next week to discuss conflict prevention her tenure will end on aug 31 after six years , the longest term that anyone has served in the job since it was created 20 years ago born into apartheid and reared as the daughter of a tamil bus driver , ms pillay rose to become the first nonwhite woman to open a law practice in south africa and the first to be appointed as a judge in the nation s high court i leave office with a sense of pride , ms pillay said in an interview last month in her lakeside geneva office in promoting human rights , she said , i have pushed my mandate to the limit as evidence of the growing influence and authority of her office , foreign policy analysts noted that ms pillay had briefed the security council more often in her six years in the job than all six previous high commissioners combined but ms pillay said she felt a touch of despair that the world had gone backward on human rights , citing the drawnout conflicts in syria and other regions and the failure of the international community to end them i , and my predecessors and successors as high commissioner for human rights , can only offer the facts , the law and common sense , ms pillay told the human rights council last month , however much we are criticized for it human rights activists give her high marks for speaking up early and vigorously on syria as well as on a string of crises in the middle east , africa and , most recently , ukraine reports from commissions of inquiry , which ms pillay set up to document atrocities in syria and north korea , are seen by many diplomats as authoritative , groundbreaking documents that provide a solid basis for eventually bringing those responsible to justice her record over all is a very strong one , peggy hicks , advocacy director of human rights watch , said in an interview from new york she has spoken out forcefully and effectively she has been a powerful presence pushing for the world and the un system to do more on those issues some of her predecessors showed more deference to governments , noted , a professor specializing in government and human rights at harvard s john f kennedy school of government ms pillay has shown no such inhibitions now , in 2014 , we have an office that is often robustly critical , professor ignatieff , a former member of the canadian parliament , said in a telephone interview it did n't begin with her , but it s been accelerated by her this is an important development , and she should be praised for that in the process , ms pillay has attracted heavy criticism , most publicly and ferociously by governments whose actions , she insisted , warranted independent international investigation , particularly israel , sri lanka and syria her statements , she said , invariably brought ambassadors to her office to vent their capitals' anger or disappointment syria s ambassador to the united nations , bashar aljaafari , called her a lunatic , and sri lanka s staterun media denounced her as a tamil tigress , implying racial bias and sympathy for separatist tamil tiger rebels eviatar manor , israel s ambassador to the united nations in geneva , told her last month that she , like the human rights council , had failed dismally in protecting the human rights of israelis the pressure never worked , ms pillay said , because i feel strength in the fact it is a mandate created by all members of the un because they felt the need to have an independent voice still , there has been a price in the job , she has visited 50 or 60 countries she has lost count but some prominent locations never made it onto her itinerary china invited her to visit but could never find a suitable date i should think it s because they see me as someone who speaks out for victims , ms pillay said the united states never invited her , despite her asking to visit several times in hopes of taking up the many issues that trouble us , she said , specifically drone strikes and targeted killings that does not show the united states in a good light , ms pillay said to preserve its authority in the world , she said , america cannot exempt itself , or its allies , from the standards it invokes to chastise other countries such bluntness appears to have cost ms pillay in other ways she acknowledges the american backing that she received for some of the causes she pursued in the human rights council but in 2012 , when her first , fouryear term as commissioner ended , she did not receive a full second term diplomats cited by the news media at the time said that american displeasure with her criticism of israel had been a factor in that decision human rights commissioners are appointed by the united nations secretary general , subject to approval by the general assembly , but major powers have a decisive say ms pillay was offered , and accepted , two more years in the job , faring better than any of her predecessors , none of whom received an extension but , she said , the halfmeasure was not accidental ms pillay said she had been told that certain countries did not want a high commissioner who was too independent other governments viewed the work of her office with suspicion some feared that she was pushing for broader democratic rights , and others challenged her support for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender causes they all argued that she should avoid creating new rights that came up again and again , she said what troubled ms pillay most , she said , was the failure of the united nations and its member states to allocate the funding for her office to keep up with the workload created by evergrowing demands from a handful of staff members in new york 20 years ago , the human rights division has grown into an operation that maintains a presence in 58 countries , she said , yet it receives less than 3 percent of the united nations' budget no organization can work like that , she said her agency s field offices , which monitor events , train officials and help draft laws or constitutions , are where we translate the rhetoric of human rights into action , ms pillay said as an example , she said that egypt , after an international outcry over recent rulings in its courts , had requested training for its judges but her office is so strapped for cash , she said , that she has been unable to answer 20 government requests for assistance that s my biggest disappointment and fear for this office , ms pillay said , that lack of resources will cripple the work

seattle outmatched denver from the beginning of the game to the end , crushing peyton manning and the broncos offense times reporters , editors and photographers offered updates all day and throughout the game on everything from the weather to the commercials , from the traffic to the halftime show they even mixed in some football analysis even the most ardent fans of the seattle seahawks were likely not predicting super bowl xlviii to be so lopsided from the flubbed snap on the game s first play right up through the fourth quarter , seattle outplayed the denver broncos in every way a week that was dominated with talk of peyton manning s legacy ended up with one of the most embarrassing losses in super bowl history , and manning was largely responsible for his team s struggles this super bowl proved a number of things experience can sometimes be less important than talent a great defense and a good offense beat a great offense and a mediocre defense and just because you call something the first coldweather super bowl does not mean it will actually be cold metlife stadium proved to be a good site for the actual game , with the main issues centering on the inability to provide adequate public transportation for the 80 , 000plus fans in attendance whether or not there is another outdoor super bowl in a coldweather city is uncertain commissioner roger goodell was noncommittal when asked about plans for more but it would be surprising for the league not to try again after this experiment has seemingly been a huge success as the few remaining fans \( all of whom appear to be seahawks fans \) linger in the stadium s lower seats , the nfl season is officially over  benjamin hoffman apparently all of richard sherman s powers of braggadocio were contained in his injured ankle his postgame comments , even if they were screamed , seem like the words of a much more humble and gracious man than the one the world met after the nfc championship game we had a lot of hard work , a lot of dedication and the team deserves it , sherman said russell wilson , earl thomas and kam chancellor , they deserve this the legion of boom , baby i hope we etched our names in the history books this is the no 1 offense in the history of the nfl and we were able to play a good game against them peyton manning may go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game , and we re just blessed to have an opportunity to play against him i can t believe it  benjamin hofffman marshawn lynch was noted for being tightlipped all week he kept that up in his press availability after the game he answered three of the questions with a total of 12 words but he did open up about not celebrating on the field man , they know how i feel about it this is big time this has been a tradition since i came , since forever it s just what i do everybody knows it they respect it for lynch , that was quite a bit of talking for his teammate richard sherman , that would barely be enough words to clear his throat  benjamin hoffman we had bounceright , counterright we were calling for it all week we knew it was a good chance we had to put that on film all year , and the guys did a heck of a job blocking as soon as i caught the ball it was open field percy harvin on his 87yard kickoff return for a touchdown  benjamin hoffman the whistle has blown , the seahawks have won and the ad bowl within super bowl xlviii is over a quick wrap on the last quarter 11 spots , by my count , on par with the third quarter , also 11 , confirming previous patterns of networks running more spots in the first half than in the second half , as insurance against just the kind of lopsided result there was sunday night many might say the ad bowl saved the best for last , or at least the mostwatched and mostliked before the game for last , in that puppy love spot for budweiser ran in the fourth quarter it kicked off an allnice , allawwwwww , hap , hap , happy commercial pod it was followed by a cheery song in a godaddy spot and the second of two doritos spots that won a consumer contest , which featured a boy , a dog and a cute ending \( question for the creator of the doritos spot do kids really still play cowboys , or is that something out of dennis the menace \? \) another notable ad in the fourth quarter was for sodastream , featuring scarlett johansson it had a different line from a previous version because fox would not let the company knock cocacola and pepsicola as it wanted to do \( the spot fox would not run was uploaded to youtube , a strategy that sodastream followed last year , too , when cbs rejected a coke pepsi poke in an ad \) in an unfortunate juxtaposition , the sodastream spot was preceded by one of three ads for tmobile the third tmobile spot was a plainlooking thing , with only text on screen , and joked that maybe next year tmobile would run an ad with overpaid movie stars then came the sodastream spot with ms johansson oops ! the 11 ads in the fourth quarter , added to 11 in the third , 17 in the second and 15 in the first , brings the super bowl xlviii ad count to 54 that is about par for recent ad bowls looking back across the entire evening , there were some dominant themes and approaches among the spots patriotic appeals and celebrations of americana were plentiful , in ads for , among others , weathertech , chrysler and cocacola as noted in a previous post , the parade of stars was one of the biggest in recent super bowls , with the later quarters adding to the ranks ms johansson , danica patrick , three cast members of full house , three british actors known for playing bad guys , johnny galecki , richard lewis , bob dylan , bruce willis , laurence fishburne and mandy patinkin and there was , in general , a sweeter tone to many of the ads compared to previous years when sexy sales pitches , sight gags and sarcasm predominated to be sure , there were some brands that sought to be daring , like butterfinger with the sex joke in the marriage counselor s office but brands like bank of america , beats music , budweiser , cheerios , chevrolet , cocacola , doritos , godaddy , honda , microsoft and toyota took a higher road be sure to come back here on monday , and check the print edition of the new york times , for another look back at all the ads of super bowl xlviii  stuart elliott an announcement was just made in metlife stadium that anyone hoping to use public transportation should remain inside the stadium until given further instruction congestion is apparently so bad that the platforms cannot handle the waiting passengers as the night starts to get colder , the success of the first coldweather outdoor super bowl could be tarnished if fans are expected to stand around for too long the line for the train at metlife is really long super bowl http tco q2a1imlzdc  steve eder \( steveeder \) 3 feb 14  benjamin hoffman malcolm smith was named the super bowl most valuable player the award had gone to an offensive player in 40 of the previous 47 super bowls , but smith s interception and fumble recovery were crucial to the seattle win all week the team s secondary , known as the legion of boom , got the attention , but it was smith who intercepted a pass to clinch the nfc championship , and once again he came up huge for his team the thirdyear player was the 242nd pick in the 2011 draft  benjamin hoffman there is blue and green confetti everywhere , with plenty of it still floating in the air my colleague steve eder points out there are cannons full of orange and blue confetti somewhere sitting unused , right \? it makes you wonder if that confetti is then sent to lesser events , similar to the way the denver broncos super bowll xlviii champions tshirts will all be sent to developing countries what happens to all the unused orange and blue confetti \? superbowl http tco zsndkj3prm  steve eder \( steveeder \) 3 feb 14  benjamin hoffman the concourse outside the openair press box became a sea of orange as denver broncos fans fled one man in an orange broncos jacket and cap , who said his name was mike , had three words for what had happened in the stadium epic failure , he said disappointing it s just football , though , you know what i mean \? he said there s more important stuff in life than football games and no , he would not say what his last name was i m a family member of a player , he said  james barron i feel like that budweiser commercial made me want to buy a puppy more than buy budweiser  jacob giesler \( jacobgiesler \) 3 feb 14 the most anticipated commercial of the super bowl and that s because budweiser floated this ad out early last week , and it stars a puppy finally ran during the twominute warning obviously , budweiser was hoping its heartstringpulling puppy clydesdale love story would get the most attention this late in the game and that strategy backfired with a dreadful blowout that has put fans in a coma that said , you can t not love this commercial hate bud hate commercialism hate bad super bowls but you have to love the puppy  lynn zinser as the confetti was fired from cannons and fell back down onto the players heads , van halen played because a more recent song would just be far too scary but for seattle , a brandnew team with a young roster , this could be the first celebration of many , and a fresh song would have felt more appropriate seattle won this game by sticking to the team s principles and exploiting the weaknesses of a team that until now did not seem to have any flaws it was a perfect example of playing together to reach a team goal while some fans left early , undoubtedly trying to avoid the transportation nightmare they experienced getting here , most of the fans made it through a noncompetitive game that at some point started to feel like a commercial for just how good the seahawks are every super bowl team has its share of players who suddenly believe they should be paid far more money and leave the team for greener pastures , but this team is filled with lowerround draft picks in their first few seasons , so they should have at least a few more years together to continue to dominate the nfl  benjamin hoffman that s it a shockingly lopsided super bowl ends with a shockingly lopsided score the seahawks win their first title , and peyton manning is the bridesmaid again the real star of the game was the seattle defense , which produced a safety on the game s first play and never let up the broncos didn t pick up a first down until the second quarter , but lost four turnovers and looked out of sorts all night seahawks quarterback russell wilson passed for 208 and 2 touchdowns \( both the jermaine kearse \) for seattle , but more important avoided the mistakes that haunted denver all night in addition to manning s two interceptions , the broncos had four fumbles , losing two of them manning finished with 34 completions \( a super bowl record \) and 280 yards , but he also threw two interceptions , including a crusher that malcolm smith returned for a touchdown in the second quarter adding to his forgettable night this crushing defeat was manning s 12th postseason loss , the most in nfl history  andrew das not surprisingly , tarvaris jackson \( ! \) couldn t lead the seahawks into the end zone so manning will get a couple more plays here and we wind it down pete carroll , meanwhile , will join jimmy johnson and barry switzer in adding a super bowl ring to an ncaa football championship well done his team was unstoppable today  andrew das he s waiting just off the field , with his foot in a boot , to join in the celebrations  andrew das question can tarvaris jackson call himself a super bowlwinning quarterback after this game \? i say yes  benjamin hoffman manning keeps trying , but at this point he s just padding numbers no one s going to remember on fourth down he drops back and gets the ball knocked out of his hands by chris clemons as he throws fumble ! ! ! and of course seattle recovers it at the denver 29 there s 3 44 left and seattle can rub their noses in it if they want  andrew das  bob eckstein with the seahawks about to win a super bowl for the first time , the list of teams that have never won it all has shrunk to 13 the minnesota vikings , buffalo bills , cincinnati bengals , philadelphia eagles , san diego chargers , atlanta falcons , tennessee titans , carolina panthers and arizona cardinals all came up empty in their super bowl appearances the cleveland browns , detroit lions , houston texans and jacksonville jaguars have never even had the chance to lose the browns and lions at least had a life before the super bowl , each winning nfl championships before the creation of the league s signature event seattle will now have championships in football and basketball \( seattle supersonics in 197879 \) the rabid sports fans of their city can now focus their attention on getting the mariners and sounders to join the city s champions club  benjamin hoffman they are disconsolate , the denver broncos fans who have tickets that let them retreat to the huge , heated lexus club at metlife stadium i can t stand to be outside waiting for my team to show up , said jim grunditsch of vail , colo i can take three steps and get a painkiller , or stay outside , where seattle fans will wave towels in my ear what would you do \? jamie darvish , wearing a washington redskins jersey , said he too was rooting for denver he said he had paid 6 , 000 for a ticket with a face value of 2 , 500 , but he had his reasons for leaving his seat and going inside it s all seattle fans where we are , he said , so i will stay in here if you had to pick two teams that have the mostchilled fans , it would be these two oh , that was tough sorry you missed that touchdown but still  james barron three quarters down , one to go , and already there is mumbling online about the lopsided score and whether advertisers in the second half of the game will regret their ad buys that is why there historically have been more ads in the first half of a super bowl than in a second also , the last few games were close until the final whistle , so buying later in the game is not on its face a foolish idea in any event , there were by my count 11 national spots in the third quarter , including a biggie from chrysler for the new chrysler 200 with a new theme , america s import , echoing imported from detroit with eminem from a previous big game this time , bob dylan replaced eminem and delivered a paean to american manufacturing and detroit that was the second such spot in the game , after weathertech in the second quarter and who would have bet that two commercials in a 2014 super bowl would feature mr dylan , much less two in the same quarter \? a chobani ad in the quarter used his song i want you \( chobani brought another bear , too , after carmax and beats music poor stephen colbert , he hates them ! \) there were many kinder , gentler ads in the third quarter , among them the goldieblox girl power salute , sponsored by intuit axe peace s paean to love the heinz ketchup salute to happy audi s pitch for adopting rescue dogs and a surprise honda spot with bruce willis urging hugs as a proxy for auto safety fortythree commercials down , by my count , let s see what the fourth quarter brings  stuart elliott demaryius thomas has 13 catches and was just targeted by peyton manning for the 17th time he already holds the super bowl record for receptions , many of them coming against richard sherman , and has been the only thing working for denver he may not come away with a super bowl ring , but he has had a memorable performance unfortunately for the broncos , he has been the only thing working on offense all game  benjamin hoffman manning has 33 completions and demaryius thomas has 13 catches both are super bowl records and nobody will care the broncos turn the ball over on downs just under 10 minutes left , and if this was a college game the walkons would be a getting a run  andrew das he was helped off a few plays ago , limped behind the bench and now is riding to the locker room on a cart and you know what \? he doesn t have to say anything today as muhammad ali famously noted , it ain t bragging if you can back it up  andrew das by my count , after tonight five super bowls will have been decided by 30 points or more the broncos will have been on the losing end of three of them update yup , just checked that s right super bowls xxii \( vs redskins \) , xxiv \( vs 49ers \) and xlviii  andrew das those denver fans had traveled so far , paid so much and come with such hope and with a quarterback like peyton manning , some could still believe even down by 368 in the third quarter but the truth is , broncos fans have started heading for the exits at metlife stadium more than one fan wearing a manning no 18 has been spotted inching toward the door and it might be their best play of the night , especially for those relying on public transportation on the reverse commute a bottleneck at secaucus , nj , made for a long , tough , journey to the game for some while seattle s big lead has made for a less competitive game , it might take some pressure off the transit system as the night wears on broncos fans have seen enough letsbeatthecrowds http tco zflheeg9mb  steve eder \( steveeder \) 3 feb 14  steve eder denver really comes up small after ending the shutout after recovering an

budweiser came next with a hero s welcome for a solder coming home to winter park , fla was probably a bit over the top , but hey , who s going to criticize for being to sentimental about soldiers \? no one  lynn zinser here come the broncos baby ! ! well , not really but manning finds demaryius thomas from 14 yards \( really nice catch under pressure , by the way \) to spoil the shutout \( that catch was his 12th , a super bowl record , and pushed him over 100 yards for the game so , um , yay for thomas \) the broncos go for 2 , and manning hits welker out of the backfield for the conversion seahawks 36 , broncos 8 they re just spoiling betting pools now  andrew das with that touchdown , the broncos are off the hook they will not be the first super bowl team to be shut out they are , however , still down by 28  benjamin hoffman there has never been a shutout in the super bowl , but the lowest score by a losing team came in the last coldweather super bowl in super bowl vi the miami dolphins scored just 3 points with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees at tulane stadium in new orleans despite the broncos currently losing 360 and having possibly the worst ever performance in a super bowl , their fans have stayed remarkably resilient there are few empty seats , and the color orange is prominent throughout metlife stadium while some have headed for the exits , the others have just stayed standing in their seats in stunned silence as their team s rocketfueled offense has looked absolutely pedestrian  benjamin hoffman if only denver had had a signal early in this game that it wasn t going to be its day  andrew das the super bowl most valuable player has been a defensive player seven times \( in super bowl xii , two cowboys defenders shared the award \) , and there is a strong likelihood that malcolm smith will make it eight his pick6 was completely demoralizing for the broncos , and his fumble recovery certainly seems to have wrapped things up as denver was moving the ball a little and suddenly was once again without the ball the last defensive player to win was dexter jackson of the tampa bay buccaneers in super bowl xxxvii it s only too bad for smith that al davis is no longer with us he loved nothing more than signing super bowl mvp s to ridiculous contracts  benjamin hoffman russell wilson with a short ball to jermaine kearse at the 23 he spins out of the first tackle , then another , then dodges another bronco touchdown ! yep , that s it everyone game over 360 five broncos had a shot at kearse all of them missed  andrew das  bob eckstein peyton manning throws , and only bad things happen , i want to go home  andrew das manning with a nice midrange ball to demaryius thomas on a run down the seam , and it looks like a big gain at last until he takes on a defender and fumbles the ball ! ! ! ! malcolm smith of course scoops it up at the 20 and returns it to his 27 wah , wah , waaaaaaaaaah  andrew das malcolm smith has really good timing an interception to end the nfc championship game , a pick6 in the super bowl and a fumble recovery in the super bowl i do not think he will be getting a christmas card from peyton manning  benjamin

have to tip your hat to audi for the sheer absurdity of the doberhuahua ad it was a silly idea that the ad writers took to even sillier lengths a dog show attacking guitars terrorizing a city street they even get kudos for the tag line , compromise scares us too  lynn zinser there has never been a super bowl shutout the lowest total came in miami s 243 loss to dallas in super bowl vi , in 1972 it s been 13 years since a team failed to reach double digits \( ravens 34 , giants 7 in 2001 \) the broncos , meanwhile , have just punted again after running a draw play on thirdand10 it lost a yard tick , tick , tick  andrew das this seahawks team is outrageously good and is the secondyoungest team in the league they are crushing the greatest regularseason offense in nfl history , and they are not even making it look hard it really is an embarrassment of riches in the nfc west , where the 49ers could easily be the team running away with a win here and the rams and the cardinals are a lot better than people realize considering the hardhitting nature of all four teams , the only thing holding them back in the next few years is how much they beat each other up  benjamin hoffman  bob

m especially excited to see him back there on kickoff return if you kick the ball to us , you never know what s going to happen with him an 87yard kickoff return for a touchdown says tate knows what he s talking about  benjamin hoffman  bob eckstein the scary thing about how well the seahawks defense played in the first half is that it did so without sacking peyton manning even once they have limited manning to a passer rating of 463 with none of the broncos famous receivers managing even 10 yards a reception the legion of boom got most of the credit for seattle s defensive efficiency this season , but the team s front seven did have the eighthmost sacks in the nfl if cliff avril and company can get to manning in the second half , this could get even uglier than it already is  benjamin hoffman before the second half starts , take a moment to enjoy this review of ren e fleming on the artsbeat blog with ren e fleming , super bowl xlviii gets an operatic opening ren e fleming became the first opera singer to perform the national anthem at the super bowl on sunday at metlife stadium in east rutherford , nj , but the word opera went unmentioned in her introduction new jersey s bruce springsteen performed at the halftime show in 2009 , the year before his home state was awarded this year s game guessing he still would have done it if asked  andrew das the second quarter is done , meaning the first half of the ad bowl inside super bowl xlviii is done , too by my count , there were 16 commercials nationally in the second quarter , plus the pepsi spot that ran a moment ago to promote pepsi s sponsorship of the halftime show three of the spots in the quarter were from advertisers that did not previously raise their hands to say they were buying time on the game geico , sonos and subway the geico and subway spots were not new not sure about the sonos spot spots not made for the super bowl , or making their debut on the game , are usually less liked than allnew ones , and sure enough , there have been several complaints on twitter already about the geico and subway spots other highlights included the following the first of two spots for cocacola was shown , with a very definitive message about diversity and inclusion , coming as cocacola is facing protests from activists unhappy that the company , which is also sponsoring the winter games in sochi , russia , has not come out against the russian treatment of gays in a news release , cocacola said that it would show a longer version of the spot during the olympics the multicultural , multiracial cast included a vignette that by my eye was meant to be a samesex male couple with their daughter weathertech ran its commercial about making its products in america , a topic very much in the news some spots with sweet themes and content were shown , including the toyota highlander spot with the muppets serenade , the volkswagen spot riffing off the line from it s a wonderful life about how angels get their wings and of course the coke spot the 16 spots in the second quarter , the pepsi spot and the 15 spots in the first quarter total 32 commercials beamed into living rooms and onto second screens nationally on to the second half  stuart elliott i will give bruno mars this he stuck to his promise to make the performance about his songs the stage theatrics were minimal and his band put on a good show it seemed anticlimactic when you consider some of the megastars who preceded him , but he certainly acquitted himself well and it was a good move by the nfl to embrace a current artist , as the league has often been overly safe of course , midway through the show the red hot chili peppers came out to sing songs that were popular 20 years ago , so it s still baby steps brunomars is killing it he s still no jtimberlake , but i m with nailajeanmeyers on this why not have a current , nonwashedup star \?  melissa hoppert \( mhoppertnyt \) 3 feb 14  benjamin hoffman before you kill

the rhetorical question , is it possible to make a terrible ad starring the muppets \? the answer , unfortunately , is yes as a band of muppets takes over driving a poor , unsuspecting man s suv , absolutely no hilarity ensues in fact , it was painful to watch even kermit looked pained at the end  lynn zinser russell wilson 9 of 14 , 94 yards , 0 interceptions peyton manning 17 of 23 , 104 yards , 2 interceptions anyone else identify the problem \? the picks were crushing sapping momentum and , of course , costing denver 7 points on the smith return but 17 completions for only 104 yards \? that s not nearly good enough for manning the running games have been negligible percy harvin is seattle s leading rusher , with two carries for 45 yards , but 30 came on one reverse marshawn lynch has 17 yards on 11 carries , while denver s knowshon moreno has 5 carries for 17  andrew das they have just turned off the heat lamps in the auxiliary press box for notbeyonc s performance this is not making me like him more but i m willing to be turned around by a good show so i hope he studied the black eyed peas performance in dallas and plans to do nothing like that  benjamin hoffman fox cut away before we could see if one of them stood up and said hey , how about you stop complaining about us \? and stop throwing the ball to the other team while you re at it \? and that s the half maybe the broncos can hug it out in the locker room  andrew das this game has been a little boring \( unless you re a seahawks fan \) , and in a few minutes the halftime show is going to star bruno mars , whom i will refer to as notbeyonc in his news conference on thursday , notbeyonc seemed quite nice , and had very tall hair but he failed at being beyonc in a way that is hard to describe  benjamin hoffman manning finds moreno at the 20 , but that s short of the first down denver takes a timeout , then eschews the field goal and goes for it bad idea manning , under pressure , underthrows his receiver on the left sideline so they get nothing  andrew das you , stephen colbert got robbed ! nobody should have their commercials anywhere near david beckham in his underwear  page \( acarygrantfan \) 3 feb 14 stephen colbert s debut hawking pistachios had an interesting twist the first part of the ad was unimpressive , unless you really like birds in fluorescent green ties but if you hung through the beefcake ad that was david beckham for hm , you got the payoff it was so fitting of a colbert bit that you would swear he wrote it do you think he did \?  lynn zinser manning has quietly , and quickly , moved the broncos to the seattle 27 , or what s also known as fieldgoal range at this point , given the way the half has gone , they ll take anything that gets that goose egg off the scoreboard  andrew das unless things change rapidly , there will be plenty of jokes at peyton manning s expense after this game some of the jokes will be deserved , but the truly unfortunate thing is that he will undoubtedly be judged as a failure to the legacy of john elway that shows a selective memory by broncos fans , as elway won two super bowls , but also lost three , including a 5510 drubbing at the hands of joe montana and the san francisco 49ers in super bowl xxiv regardless of the final result , manning is an alltime great if he were to come back and win a super bowl before retiring , his losses would be forgotten , just as they were for elway  benjamin hoffman denver keeps the ball  andrew das the officials give the ball to the seahawks , but a replay sure makes it look as if he was down before the ball was out there will be a review of the turnover denver needs this call  andrew das malcolm smith , with crucial interceptions in consecutive playoff games , had two career interceptions heading into this year s playoffs apparently the thirdyear player out of southern california only goes for the ball when it really matters  benjamin hoffman among recent denver broncos quarterbacks , the strongest performer so far tonight is tim tebow , in something of an upset  ben rothenberg \( benrothenberg \) 3 feb 14 when tmobile announced it had signed tim tebow for a super bowl ad , well , it was going to be worth watching no matter what the ad used the irony of tebow being out of football perfectly , asking , what can you do with out a contract \? part of the answer was find and tackle sasquatch not bad tmobile hopes viewers like tebow better than nfl coaches did  lynn zinser manning is hit as he throws on thirdandlong by orlando franklin , and the resulting duck is plucked out of the air by linebacker malcolm smith and he s gone returning it 69 yards for a touchdown ! the only part of the play smith bungled was his spike over the crossbar after running more than 70 yards , he got only about nine feet high oh well , they don t take points off the board for style seattle 22 , denver 0 and the momentum that had been slowly shifting swings closed like a garden gate wow  andrew das and the first quarter of the ad bowl inside the super bowl is complete three quarters to go , assuming there is no overtime there were by my count 15 national commercials in the quarter , including two from the bud light upforwhatever campaign , much promoted before the game two from chevrolet , one with a charity component one of two godaddy spots another charitythemed ad , from bank of america the first commercial from chrysler group , for the new maserati and one of the winners of the annual crash the super bowl contest sponsored by doritos , inviting consumers to create ads overall impressions so far are mixed , with a notable , if not uncommon observation lots of celebrities three in the bud light spots , ellen degeneres in the beats music spot , john c reilly supplying the narration in the turbotax spot john turtorro helping a woman quit her job in the godaddy spot u2 singing for bank of america and jeff bridges narrating the hyundai genesis spot two charity ads in one quarter also seems to suggest a kinder kind of tone to the super bowl commercials  stuart elliott malcolm smith stepped right in front of a wobbling pass by peyton manning and took it back for a picksix it should be noted that it was smith who was in such fantastic position to catch richard sherman s deflection in the nfc championship game that won it for seattle manning s second interception was an absolute crushing blow for denver  benjamin hoffman kam chancellor has returned to the game , but denver has continued to show some movement for the first time this game peyton manning is looking more animated and the denver half of the crowd is waking back up a score here would certainly be good for helping this game avoid turning into a blowout  benjamin hoffman with 10 30 left in the first half , knowshon moreno bulls over the right side for denver s first first down of the game is it the start of something \? let s see them get another first but don t think for a minute that 15 points is enough against peyton manning  andrew das kam chancellor seemed to be ok when walking off the field after being shaken up on a kickoff , but if he is unable to return it is hard to quantify how bad that would be for seattle one of the absolute keys to seattle s style of play is the interaction between chancellor and earl thomas losing either safety for an extended period would hurt seattle more than losing richard sherman , as hard as that is to believe \( especially for richard sherman \)  benjamin hoffman seattle s kam chancellor , the hardhitting defensive back , was injured making a tackle on the kickoff after the seahawks touchdown always a peril when a starter plays on special teams he s walked off on his own  andrew das both golden tate and doug baldwin spent the week being asked about the return of percy harvin while both remained optimistic that harvin would be a huge help to the team , they also could be excused if they wanted some credit for helping get seattle to the super bowl one thing cited by all of the seahawks was the presence harvin would provide and how that would open things up for the other receivers so far that seems to be working as baldwin is the team s leading receiver with 3 catches for 50 yards while harvin s contributions have come on running plays  benjamin hoffman  bob eckstein after a pass interference calls gives them a firstandgoal , seattle shifts into beast mode with marshawn lynch slamming into the line twice and delivering a 1yard touchdown the extra point makes it 150 three minutes into the second quarter you re fooling yourself if you don t think it feels as if it should be a lot more  andrew das did radio shack just admit they are old and outdated \?  ken boxx \( kboxx97 \) 3 feb 14 radio shack decided to tease the coming redesign of its stores in hilarious fashion the 80s called it wants its store back so , in comes everything from alf to mary lou retton only possible problem \? if you didn t live through the 80s , does any of that strike you as funny \?  lynn zinser turnovers and time of possession are often what people look to when trying to decide who will win a game so far , this one is all seattle there are many slightly chilly fans wearing orange who are having second thoughts about paying four figures to go to a football game  benjamin hoffman denver is actually pretty lucky it s still a game if the broncos defense hadn t held seattle to two field goals , they d be in danger of getting blown out in the next few minutes  andrew das sometimes omaha means omaha and hurry means hurry and sometimes , it seems , the offensive linemen of the denver broncos aren t sure which is which that , at least , seemed to be what happened on the first play of the super bowl quarterback peyton manning stepped toward his linemen to scream instructions when the ball went flying past his head perhaps center manny ramirez misunderstood the snap count or saw manning move in anticipation of a snap or perhaps manning was being manning and tried to call a new play based on how seattle s defense lined up manning , after all , is the master of the audible who uses a complex matrix of code words to alert his teammates of new plays while simultaneously deceiving defenses the system works particularly well when manning plays at home because broncos fans \( and colts fans before them \) lower their voices so the broncos can hear manning s calls during a playoff game against the chargers several weeks ago , it was so quiet that microphones near the field picked up manning yelling omaha dozens of times but at metlife stadium , manning lined up near the seattle end zone where many seahawks fans were sitting could the 12th man have helped their team score the first 2 points of the game \?  ken belson nope even worse manning overthrows julius thomas down the middle on third down and the ball lands right in the arms of seattle s kam chancellor at the denver 37 ruh roh richard sherman , your thoughts \? are you kidding me \? ! \? ! you re going to try to come over the middle with a sorry throw like that ! don t you ever throw that ball ! thanks , richard talk later \?  andrew das kam chancellor just did his best to lower the boom on wes welker luckily for welker , chancellor s 6foot3 frame is simply too tall to get a clean hit on a 59 wide receiver he shot right over him then chancellor showed his versatility , picking off manning and setting up yet another seattle drive on offense the seattle secondary is easily looking as good as advertised  benjamin hoffman wilson finds jermaine kearse in the end zone , but denver s nate irving pops the ball out of his hands , so hauschka comes on for another field goal seattle now leads , 80 , in the third inning i mean , first quarter denver coach john fox used his challenge just before the thirddown play , to question whether an incompletion was actually a lateral \( he was wrong \) but the challenge almost seemed as if he was just buying his defense a minute to try to figure out what the heck is going on to their credit , they re keeping manning in this game by forcing field goals but they ve been on the field a lot in the early going  andrew das the seahawks have now scored three times , and yet peyton manning and the highpowered broncos offense could tie the game with one touchdown and a 2point conversion while denver has shown little ability to move the ball against seattle , this game is still wide open considering how much seattle has appeared to dominate on both sides of the ball , that s truly remarkable  benjamin hoffman well , turbo tax good commercial until it turned out to be for turbo tax  steve hofstetter \( stevehofstetter \) 2 feb 14 turbo tax has turned up its ad game for this tax season , with some nice , unusual ads this month , but its first super bowl effort really tested the edges of creativity since when does a high school promlooking dance have something to do with online tax filing \? not sure i know even after watching it but they get points for bold  lynn zinser marshawn lynch has not done much so far \( five carries for 6 yards \) , but seahawks fans know a runner of lynch s style often takes quite a while to get going on each play , denver is committing multiple interior players to bringing the big running back down , and over the course of the game those big players tend to wear down if seattle shows a commitment to giving lynch the ball , he ll eventually find holes that are not opening so far  benjamin hoffman make that 7 of 10 for wilson , for 82 yards , after doug baldwin runs under a beautifully floated pass over champ bailey for a 37yard gain first and goal at the 6 and denver can t seem to do anything to stop it  andrew das russell wilson is 6 for 8 after a short pass to percy harvin , and the broncos can t seem to lay a glove on him he s had plenty of time in the pocket , but when there s not enough , he s gone all the broncos can do is chase  andrew das michael robinson , who just reeled in a 7yard catch , is useful for many things other than serving as the temporary voice of marshawn lynch \( as he did during the seahawks media availabilities \) the big fullback was a quarterback and wide receiver during his time at penn state he is talked about a lot less than derrick coleman , but robinson is a solid football player who contributes to seattle in a number of ways  benjamin hoffman the broncos go nowhere a 3yard run , and passes of 2 and 3 yards but look at the bright side at least they didn t go backward eli manning pulls out his cellphone and texts peyton s number dude , when i won my two super bowls , he s what we did  andrew das so far , bud light and doritos are tied for worst super bowl commercial in 2014  ant \( soulvester \) 2 feb 14 the latest doritos ad is always much anticipated in the super bowl , and the first one wasn t a disappointment it featured a kiddriven time machine that seems to work when dad comes out to discover his son has gotten old or not it wasn t worth a belly laugh , but worth a smile  lynn zinser it should be pointed out as often as possible that knowshon moreno s name is a combination of his father s nickname \( knowledge \) and his mother s name \( varashon \)  benjamin hoffman five minutes into the game , he ll get to touch the ball for the first time on denver s second play  andrew das holding the seahawks to a field goal has to be seen as a victory for the broncos off to a brutal start in which their one offensive play resulted in 2 points for the seahawks , the broncos now have the ball back and are less than a touchdown behind as for the cold weather , it is official that super bowl vi will keep its title as the coldest super bowl on record at kickoff it was a balmy 49 degrees , or 10 degrees warmer than the broncos and the dolphins had way back when  benjamin hoffman carroll was wrong , and it ll cost him a timeout a penalty pushes the seahawks back as they line up to kick , but steven hauschka laughs at your extra 5 yards hahaha ! and bangs the kick from 31 seattle 5 , denver 0 with 10 21 left in the first quarter if you thought that 5 you drew in your super bowl squares was never going to happen , things may be looking up for you  andrew das it s really easy to forget about russell wilson as a runner the seahawks offense is focused so heavily on marshawn lynch that wilson flies under the radar in terms of his ability to scramble and do planned runs but that speed , which he used to set up a fourthand1 \( seattle challenged the play but the call on the field stood \) , is a weapon not only on a broken play , but also to give him time to throw denver s defense is nothing special , and chasing wilson all day will wear out their front seven  benjamin hoffman seattle gets to denver s 14 , but on thirdand6 russell wilson keeps the ball and rolls left diving for the firstdown marker he ends up a yard short though , so seattle will have to settle for a field goal but hold on pete carroll is challenging the spot \? replays show he s wasting his time  andrew das 6 , 0001 safety on first play think about that  matt hayes \( matt hayessn \) 2 feb 14 how much do you believe in momentum \? the seahawks were gifted a 20 lead on a bad snap \( the resulting safety was the fastest score in super bowl history \) and percy harvin , who had all of one catch this season , just reeled off a huge run with the seahawks now in the red zone , the broncos have immediately been put on their heels , and if seattle can score on this possession denver will have quite a hole to climb out of  benjamin hoffman after the penalty forces a short kickoff , seattle safely navigates a first down and then hands to percy harvin on a reverse only a step out of bounds after a 30yard gain prevents a touchdown denver appears to be on mountain time still better get the engine firing soon , because seattle is flying  andrew das after the broncos trindon holliday runs the kickoff back to only the 14 , peyton manning steps up to change the play on first down as his center , manny ramirez , snaps the ball over his head the broncos knowshon moreno covers it in the end zone , but that s a safety \( they actually had a penalty on the play too , so , you know , great job guys \) seattle 2 , denver 0 after 12 seconds  andrew das so much talk this week centered on experience peyton manning , the most experienced man on the field , just flubbed a snap that resulted in a safety and a 20 lead for seattle so i guess maybe experience isn t everything \?  benjamin hoffman seattle has elected to have its defense on the field to start the game that makes sense considering the legion of boom is undoubtedly excited to get booming receiving the ball to start the second half will be nice as well if only matt hasselbeck , the former seahawks quarterback , had been there to declare , we want the ball and we re going to score ! as he did after winning a coin toss before overtime in 2004 of course , the seahawks lost that game  benjamin hoffman but only after the referee almost steals joe namath s thunder by flipping the coin himself i guess the players aren t the only ones with nerves seattle will kick off enjoy the game  andrew das untrue super bowl fact no 1 a team led onto the field by a woman on a white horse has never lost the super bowl  andrew das there was one thing that could unite broncos and seahawks fans on sunday public transportation as fans wearing both teams colors spilled into metlife stadium , a number were sharing tales of a horrible commute to the game it was those who took trains from manhattan through secaucus who seemed to have gotten the worst of it there , fans described a scene where it was hot they guessed that it was over 95 degrees they said they saw people fainting some said people were urinating as they waited in the shouldertoshoulder crowds it was an epic fail , said joe knittel , 32 , of seattle , after he spent four hours making his way to the game from manhattan , finally arriving about an hour before kickoff even after making it through secaucus , he and his friends said they waited in a long line to enter the stadium that , too , they said was problematic , as fans lining up outside the security screening tents freely cut in front of each other as busloads of people arrived , prompting arguing and shouting  steve eder  bob eckstein seattle cornerback richard sherman s postgame rant to the fox reporter erin andrews after the nfc championship game , shortly after he made a critical defensive play that helped the seahawks reach super bowl xlviii , instantly catapulted him into the national spotlight  on the first day of player availability , shortly after the seahawks touched down in new york , sherman was surrounded by television cameras and reporters , about 20 people deep meanwhile , the seahawks young star quarterback , russell wilson , had about only 20 people total lingering around his podium at the jersey city westin the trend continued throughout the week , especially at media day , where sherman drew the biggest crowd of players from both teams wilson did not seem to mind asked if he was surprised that sherman had received so much attention in the past week , he replied no i mean , he s a great football player wilson , who also played minor league baseball , continued all of the things that he s done for our football team , he deserves the attention with the way that he plays i love that about richard sherman , laughing and smiling through it all , embraced the attention but also asked for his teammates to be recognized i think that these cameras could be anywhere , he said they could be on all my teammates , and they deserve it  melissa hoppert the seahawks are introduced first , and the boos that greet them give a sense of how the crowd is leaning the broncos run out next

it is almost game time for madison avenue as well as for the nfl , as marketers and agencies get ready for the annual ad bowl inside the super bowl more than 50 commercials are planned to appear during the game , from a mix of mainstay super bowl advertisers among them , anheuserbusch , cocacola , general motors , godaddy , mars , movie studios and pepsico and newcomers like beats music , chobani yogurt , jaguar , squarespace and weathertech although most of the commercials have been available for viewing before the game , in social media like youtube , there are some that are being kept under wraps until they appear for instance , chrysler said late on friday that it would return the company has garnered considerable attention in recent super bowls for spots with content that surprised viewers like a halftime appeal by clint eastwood come back here during the game for comments after each quarter , looking at some highlights and lowlights of the super bowl xlviii spots  stuart elliott football coaches are notorious creatures of habit , and among those habits is programming every minute leading up to kickoff of a game the super bowl is where seasonlong habits go to die the broncos and the seahawks have been shooed from the field to make room for pregame pageantry , and they will be forced to sit and sit , and sit for roughly 30 minutes until the game starts it is just one thing that makes the super bowl a bit of a different experience for teams the length of the halftime show is another we wrote about this a few years ago , when the giants and patriots played in the super bowl their coaches , tom coughlin and bill belichick , are not known for having the patience of today s coaches , seattle s pete carroll and denver s john fox  john branch ren e fleming , who will be performing the starspangled banner in a few minutes , had a vision in her head of bringing dancers with her to the super bowl to turn the national anthem into a live opera on the field instead , she decided to play it straight and perform with a recording by the new jersey symphony while people were betting heavily on her going over the standard 1 minute 40 seconds , fleming was mostly concerned about how being amplified would affect her performance the native of rochester was hardly worried about the cold  benjamin hoffman after broncos receiver eric decker tells fox about how it s been a week full of emotion but now it s time to play some football , richard sherman s not looking so bad anymore , is he \? usually you have to wait until after the game to ignore insight like that  andrew das known as the city that never sleeps , new york welcomed the super bowl spectacle with open arms the big game was met with no shortage of big parties , so many in fact that ones that would normally be considered a hot ticket were all of a sudden a lot easier to get into consider that jay z s roc nation sports party at the 40 40 club on saturday night , attended by the yankees ace cc sabathia , a roc nation client , and former and current nfl players like ladainian tomlinson and adrian peterson , was actually overshadowed by the directv party at new york s pier 40 stadium , hosted by , you guessed it , jay z , with a special appearance by his wife , beyonc that did not dampen the mood at the 40 40 club , where eagles linebacker mychal kendricks and friends occupied a prime table mistaken by some as the hiphop artist chris brown , kendricks relished the attention even brown s exgirlfriend rihanna sees a resemblance , recently naming kendricks her crush on man crush monday on twitter other hot tickets were parties held by maxim \( including justin bieber misbehaving \) , playboy \( situated between the intrepid museum and the bud light hotel \) and espn \( headlined by the singer robin thicke \) at the foxsports1 party in the meatpacking district on thursday , aaron paul of breaking bad had his picture snapped with bill murray as the band kings

restaurants and guest appearances by dj questlove of the roots and constantine maroulis of american idol and the broadway show rock of ages  melissa hoppert the fans are all charged up or they were hours ago now some of them are discovering that their cellphones are running low , and they are desperate to find a charger it took forever to get here , said jordan springer of mercer island , wash , who said he had downloaded a transit app on his apple iphone before he boarded the train from manhattan he talked to people in seattle on the way to metlife stadium and i was taking pictures , which i sent , he said gerard smith of garden city , ny , borrowed a charger from a reporter in the auxiliary press box when he realized his iphone was also close to death i was taking a thousand pictures the moment i walked in , he said , adding that he was thinking about finding a phone with longer battery life but that will have to wait until after the game  james barron you d have to go back 15 super

mentioned in it  andrew das seattle wide receiver percy harvin missed all but one regularseason game because of hip surgery although he returned for the divisional playoff round , he sustained a concussion that forced him to miss the nfc championship game despite all of that , look for the seahawks to attempt to establish harvin early as a threat he can serve as an effective decoy , if not

one traveler asked , could riders find the connecting trains to metlife stadium once they arrived in secaucus \? follow everybody else , an employee said though winding lines formed beside ticket windows as early as 1 pm , many fans said that the first leg of their trip getting to secaucus had gone relatively smoothly , despite the swelling crowds still , visitors appeared to greet penn station itself , long derided by locals , with ambivalence it s functional , said toby anderson , 45 , a broncos fan from sacramento as far as the cleanliness , you know , what are you going to do \? along platforms and near ticket machines , a series of chants and taunts filled the space go hawks ! , omaha ! and , in one clear reach , peyton manning is mediocre at best other atypical occurrences for the station included fans happily snapping photographs at ticket windows and at least one seahawks supporter massaging the shoulder of a new jersey transit employee then there were the regular commuters , caught in the undertow of russell wilson jerseys i have no involvement with the super bowl , ashley glaser , 19 , a student from park ridge , nj , said to a ticket agent i just want to get home glaser said in an interview moments later that the scene on stpatrick s day had probably been worse but she cautioned that it was early no one is too drunk yet , she said  matt flegenheimer the main concerns with a new york super bowl were the potential for cold weather and the problems with transporting so many people through the new york metropolitan area having left manhattan in the first wave of media buses , i was able to get here and through security without any issues now seated in the auxiliary press box , the massive heating system installed to deal with the weather is so strong that no jacket is needed so if the hiccups are transportation and weather , the nfl is 2 for 2 so far the lack of vegetarian meal options will have to be investigated , but otherwise we re all systems go there are not enough fans in the stands to get an idea of whether this crowd will be rooting for denver or seattle , but one thing is clear against the gray seats of metlife stadium , the orange broncos jerseys show up quite a bit better than the blue and gray seahawks jerseys , so it may end up looking like a broncos home game  benjamin hoffman media bus no 1 was scheduled to leave times square for metlife stadium at 1 15 pm it was full by 12 15 a 56passenger commuter bus packed with reporters and photographers then came the security check two police officers and a dog boarded about

driver just kidding but the driver closed the door and no one has gotten on or off since departure time remained 1 15  james barron i got a chance to take in the atmosphere of super bowl week from a couple of locations  bob eckstein there is an old scandinavian saying that roughly translates to , there is no bad weather , only bad clothing early last week , it looked as if 80 , 000 fans in metlife stadium would be testing that theory in real time when the seahawks played the broncos in super bowl xlviii but having bet on the league s ability to handle its first coldweather super bowl , the nfl has seemingly caught a break the temperature at kickoff is expected to be as high as the mid40s , falling short of the coldest in super bowl history , a distinction held by super bowl vi in new orleans it was 39 degrees at tulane stadium when mike clark of the dallas cowboys kicked off to mercury morris of the miami dolphins and 81 , 023 people watched the cowboys win , 243 with sunday s weather largely taken out of the equation , the fans in the stadium and at home will be free to focus on the matchup of the most productive offense in nfl history and a young defense that already appears to be one of the best ever assembled  as with all super bowls , there have been plenty of subplots to keep people talking the players were hounded all week , and the consensus from the news media was that richard sherman talked too much , marshawn lynch talked not enough , and peyton manning was just right along the way , there was enough discussion of macklemore and legalized marijuana to make you occasionally forget that a football game was going to be played but when the ball kicks off sometime after 6 25 pm eastern , the nfl will have its two best teams playing in the nation s

conway , sc joe moglia s life story sounds as if it was concocted in hollywood , but as improbable as it may seem , it is not fiction there is no fudging on his r sum , no invented jobs only an unlikely narrative that would make a good movie there is a fair chance it will at some point his story goes like this a journeyman assistant football coach , toiling at the college level , moglia eventually abandons his passion to pursue a career on wall street he quickly rises to a top job at a giant firm , then quits to run an upstart brokerage in omaha having earned billions for investors and many millions for himself , moglia steps down at 59 to resume his quest to be a head football coach rejected at nearly every turn , he lands at an upandcoming college program in a small southern outpost and promptly leads it to a no 1 ranking and a shot at a national title in the second tier of division i football and there was another twist in the past week , when moglia suddenly found himself being touted as a dark horse to fill one of the most coveted jobs in the business head coach at nebraska , where the incumbent was fired last weekend but that talk was squelched on thursday , when nebraska picked oregon state s mike riley to fill the position still , it was remarkable in itself that moglia was part of the conversation i 've been incredibly fortunate to have two careers that i 've been pretty good at and both of which i really love , moglia said recently as he sat in his office it s a great story indeed , as he prepares to lead the chanticleers of coastal carolina university into a football championship subdivision playoff game saturday against richmond , moglia has become a 65yearold marvel over the past week , as he delivered speeches to his players , interviewed recruits and met with his staff , he was chased by reporters wanting his thoughts on the nebraska job , which would have been the perfect topping on his layer cake of careers not that he is n't reasonably satisfied now i do n't have to take a bigger job because of the money , said moglia , who makes roughly 185 , 000 a year as the coach of coastal carolina my ego does n't tell me i 've got to play in a bigger stadium in a twist and there have been many for moglia it was the justdismissed nebraska coach , bo pelini , who was instrumental in helping moglia manage the leap from finance back to football in 2008 , moglia was near the end of his seventh year as the chief executive of td ameritrade , a brokerage firm based in omaha he had taken on the job after being lured away from merrill lynch by ameritrade s founder , joe ricketts , whose family now owns the chicago cubs and wrigley field it had been a wise move for moglia , but he wanted to step down as chief executive to pursue his football dream , although he agreed , in departing , to become the chairman of ameritrade , a parttime job with bigtime responsibility \( it is a title he still holds , making him the only college football coach who currently oversees the management of a multibilliondollar enterprise \) but how did he find a college willing to hire him as its coach after all those years in the financial world \? and for that matter , how did he land on wall street after working as a football assistant for more than a decade after leaving college \? simple in both cases , he was willing to start at the bottom here s a guy with a career under his belt , he s a little older than the other guys , he has several kids , but he s not such a bad bet , moglia recounted as he thought back to how his 1983 application to join a merrill lynch training program might have struck the company merrill lynch apparently took the same view moglia did , and soon he was training alongside several dozen graduates with mbas from there , moglia , who once worked at his father s fruit stand in manhattan , ended up with a job at the brokerage selling bonds , then quickly rose through several layers of management he used the same approach when he decided , all those years later , to return to football he reached out to tom osborne , the former nebraska coach , who suggested that moglia shadow pelini , then in his second year with the cornhuskers , to get reacquainted with the sideline pelini agreed to the idea so for the next two years , moglia served as an unpaid executive assistant , studying nebraska game plans , watching film and counseling players about what moglia called life after football all the while , he sought a college that would take a chance on a retired chief executive who had cashed his last paycheck as a football coach in the early 1980s a few places nibbled , but none bit , so moglia took the only offer that came his way from the omaha nighthawks of the shortlived united football league the nighthawks won just one of their five games in the 2011 season but for moglia , it was vital experience two months later , in a move that stirred up a tempest in the world of south carolina football , david decenzo , coastal carolina s president , , of his duties and hired moglia to succeed him it s either going to be the most phenomenal decision i 've ever made , or i'm going to look back and say , ohoh , ' decenzo said at the time bennett had been a popular figure , a man with local roots who had recently been coach of the year in the big south conference he had even drawn national attention when his performance at a news conference in 2011 went viral on youtube sharing a story that he had told his players about a stray cat , bennett concluded be a dog we do n't need no meows , we do n't need no cats  when bennett was pushed aside , his supporters immediately speculated that moglia had used his wealth to buy the job moglia and decenzo denied that , but the rumors flared anew this fall when td bank , which owns about 40 percent of ameritrade , agreed to pay 5 million for the naming rights of the athletic complex at coastal carolina would this have occurred without joe \? i doubt it , said wilbur prezzano , a director on the boards of td bank and ameritrade who lives in charleston , sc prezzano , a former executive at kodak , said he had been impressed by how successfully moglia made the transition from the financial industry back to coaching occasionally , though , moglia still travels in the other direction on nov 20 , for instance , two days before the final game of coastal carolina s regular season , moglia left his team and flew to new york to have dinner with the directors of ameritrade and pay tribute to j peter ricketts , a son of the founder , who was about to become governor of nebraska the next day , moglia served as chairman of ameritrade s board meeting in manhattan , which lasted more than five hours as soon as it was over , he was on a private jet back to south carolina and the next day , brooks stadium was buzzing as fans wearing teal filed in to see the undefeated chanticleers host liberty , a conference rival coastal took a 73 lead early in the second quarter and led , 1412 , late in the fourth as liberty drove toward a goahead score on the coastal carolina sideline , the coaches discussed whether to allow liberty to score a touchdown quickly so there would be enough time to respond but moglia decided against it his defense held liberty to a field goal , leaving coastal carolina 1 minute 20 seconds to get into range for a winner and it did , moving to liberty s 6yard line with three seconds left but alex catron , a senior who had missed his only previous attempt in the game , kicked a low wobbler that was blocked asked afterward if he had considered sending out a different kicker at the end , moglia said he had never lost faith in catron instead , moglia blamed himself for the loss that s on me , he said repeatedly he has tried to instill a certain philosophy in his players , which he summed up in three words be a man it strikes a chord with parents like bruce mapp sr , the father of the team s leading receiver i do n't think it s corny at all , mapp said from his home in philadelphia you never forget the life lessons you 're taught when you 're young he said he had seen steady maturation in his son under moglia s mentorship and said he was especially proud of how his son acted after the tough loss to liberty my son went down there and shook everybody s hand , mapp said , even though the liberty players were whooping it up on the field coastal carolina finished the season 111 and fell to a no 7 seeding in the playoffs if the team gets past richmond , the chanticleers will probably have to travel to fargo to face north dakota state , which has won three straight championships winning it all may be a long shot , but it would be just one more twist in the continuing joe moglia story somewhere down the road , he has said , he wants to work on his italian and his piano playing for now , there are more games to coach and who knows what else awaits \?
washington the dismal flood of news out of could hardly be more discouraging for president of  the downing of , apparently at the hands of russianbacked separatists , and the ghastly scenes at the crash site shocked the world after months of dithering , western leaders have imposed sweeping economic sanctions against russia the separatists themselves are in retreat , battered and bloodied mr putin appears to be cornered so why are western leaders so antsy \? because a cornered prey is unpredictable a memorable passage from mr putin s 2000 quasi autobiography , first person , tells you everything you need to know growing up in a dilapidated leningrad apartment building , mr putin used to chase rats with sticks once i spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until i drove it into a corner , he recounted it had nowhere to run suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me i was surprised and frightened now the rat was chasing me mr putin s risky , impetuous moves have surprised many observers , me included annexing crimea framing russia s foreign policy around protecting the russian world \( the kremlin s code word for the legions of russian speakers scattered throughout the former soviet union \) and subcontracting the insurgency in eastern ukraine to marginal figures like ultranationalists , con artists and runofthemill criminals none of this seemed plausible before it happened even now , six months into this crisis , western leaders do n't know how far mr putin will go in ukraine president obama said as much at a recent news conference , fretting that while mr putin should want to resolve the crisis diplomatically , people do n't always act rationally unfortunately , something more insidious than irrationality may be at work using sanctions as the principal tool to punish and deter moscow has created a situation in which mr putin may reasonably believe that the west s real goal is what he has long suspected regime change in russia , not just in ukraine and that he cannot afford to retreat but even if western governments wanted to explore a quiet compromise , it s not clear whom they could talk to in moscow nearly all of the important figures in the russian power structure are on the sanctions list save mr putin the obamaputin phone calls , which are closely monitored by both countries' foreign policy bureaucracies , have become a poor venue for real give and take for want of a better option , western powers seem to be banking on letting the ukrainians bloody moscow s nose , which might set up a more fruitful diplomatic process somewhere down the road combined with the sanctions effort , the west s policy is based primarily on the hope that mr putin will eventually change course or that elite and public support for him will fracture unfortunately , time is not on the west s or ukraine s side moscow is once again building up its troop presence along the border , and there is growing fear that mr putin will intervene militarily even the severe sanctions on the stateowned russian banking sector will take time to bite , given moscow s hard currency reserves and limited refinancing needs the longer the war continues , the more challenging it will be to sustain ukraine s ravaged , dysfunctional economy , especially as winter approaches against the backdrop of mr putin s skyhigh popularity and a surge in nationalist sentiment , the kremlin can simply blame foreign enemies for any economic difficulties it encounters preventing russia from establishing a protectorate or frozen conflict in eastern ukraine is an urgent and worthy goal but we need to ask whether the course we 're on is too risky one immediate priority should be reestablishing real channels of communication with mr putin and his inner circle we still do n't know what they want while reminding mr putin not to underestimate western or ukrainian resolve , mr obama can highlight the cost to russia of further escalation and put on the table three proposals , which must be closely coordinated with kiev the first would be to establish a lasting , verifiable ceasefire under the auspices of the united nations or the organization for security and cooperation in europe , combined with a reinforced bordermonitoring effort to block additional military assistance to the separatists second , kiev would agree to honor its commitments to transfer power to regional governments , protect the russian language and arrange for direct election of local officials all objectives of the russianbacked groups the third proposal would be to begin a conversation about the future of ukraine between russia and the west even such ideologically different geostrategists as zbigniew brzezinski and henry a kissinger are on record as favoring some form of neutrality for ukraine for the foreseeable future mr putin may not be receptive to these ideas , of course , but mr obama can remind him that it s probably only a matter of time before the united states supplies lethal military assistance to the ukrainians and nato expands its presence along russia s borders any durable solution to the ukraine crisis will require both kiev and moscow to find political wiggle room and to forge a muchneeded longterm accommodation on political , economic and energy ties that cannot be replaced by the west at the same time , mr putin s capabilities and willingness to wreak havoc inside ukraine and even farther afield in places like the baltics are not going to disappear anytime soon we should keep that in mind before betting on his unconditional surrender
it s hard to believe , but almost six years have passed since the fall of lehman brothers ushered in the worst economic crisis since the 1930s many people , myself included , would like to move on to other subjects but we ca n't , because the crisis is by no means over recovery is far from complete , and the wrong policies could still turn economic weakness into a more or less permanent depression in fact , that s what seems to be happening in europe as we speak and the rest of us should learn from europe s experience before i get to the latest bad news , let s talk about the great policy argument that has raged for more than five years it s easy to get bogged down in the details , but basically it has been a debate between the toomuchers and the notenoughers the toomuchers have warned incessantly that the things governments and central banks are doing to limit the depth of the slump are setting the stage for something even worse deficit spending , they suggested , could provoke a greekstyle crisis any day now , declared alan simpson and erskine bowles some three and a half years ago asset purchases by the federal reserve would risk currency debasement and inflation , declared a who s who of republican economists , investors , and pundits  the notenoughers a group that includes yours truly have argued all along that the clear and present danger is japanification rather than hellenization that is , they have warned that inadequate fiscal stimulus and a premature turn to austerity could lead to a lost decade or more of economic depression , that the fed should be doing even more to boost the economy , that deflation , not inflation , was the great risk facing the western world to say the obvious , none of the predictions and warnings of the toomuchers have come to pass america never experienced a greektype crisis of soaring borrowing costs in fact , even within europe the debt crisis largely faded away once the european central bank began doing its job as lender of last resort meanwhile , inflation has stayed low however , while the notenoughers were right to dismiss warnings about interest rates and inflation , our concerns about actual deflation have n't yet come to pass this has provoked a fair bit of \( if there has been any rethinking on the other side of this argument , i have n't seen it \) , but notenoughers continue to worry about the risks of a japantype quasipermanent slump which brings me to europe s woes on the whole , the toomuchers have had much more influence in europe than in the united states , while the notenoughers have had no influence at all european officials eagerly embraced that allegedly justified fiscal austerity even in depressed economies \( although america has de facto done a lot of austerity , too , thanks to the sequester and cuts at the state and local level \) and the european central bank , or ecb , not only failed to match the fed s asset purchases , back in 2011 to head off the imaginary risk of inflation the ecb reversed course when europe slid back into recession , and , as i 've already mentioned , under mario draghi s leadership , it did a lot to alleviate the european debt crisis but this was n't enough the european economy did start growing again last year , but not enough to make more than a small dent  , while far below the ecb s target of 2 percent , and prices are actually falling in debtor nations it s really a dismal picture mr draghi co need to do whatever they can to try to turn things around , but given the political and institutional constraints they face , europe will arguably be lucky if all it experiences is one lost decade the good news is that things do n't look that dire in america , where job creation seems finally to have picked up and the threat of deflation has receded , at least for now but all it would take is a few bad shocks and or policy missteps to send us down the same path the good news is that janet yellen , the fed chairwoman , understands the danger that she would rather take the chance of a temporary rise in the inflation rate than risk hitting the brakes too soon , the way the ecb did in 2011 the bad news is that she and her colleagues are under a lot of pressure to do the wrong thing from the toomuchers , who seem to have learned nothing from being wrong year after year , and are still agitating for higher rates there s an old joke about the man who decides to cheer up , because things could be worse and sure enough , things get worse that s more or less what happened to europe , and we should n't let it happen here

istanbul president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey keeps making global headlines first it was for claiming that muslims discovered the new world then it was that you cannot put women and men on an equal footing last week , it was for supporting the arrest , by turkish police , of a number of journalists but in the long run , it is his reforms of the turkish education system that will likely be the most influential and detrimental to the global competitiveness of the country s next generation earlier this month , mr erdogan by turkey s national education council to make ottoman turkish an older version of the language , written in arabic letters mandatory in religious high schools , and available as an elective in secular high schools flouting earlier rulings by the european court of human rights , the council also proposed that religious education be compulsory from age six the president s response to sharp criticism of these initiatives from turkish politicians and civil groups was characteristic the changes would take place whether they like it or not , mr erdogan said in other words , as is often the case in turkey , a war over ideology dominated the agenda , while the practical needs of turkey s future generations were overlooked the national education council did not put any emphasis on foreign language instruction , for example , despite the fact that turks generally fare poorly when it comes to speaking any language other than their own particularly languages like english , chinese or arabic that could help turkish businesses grow , both in the region and globally nor was there any emphasis on critical thinking or democratic values the very qualities that could help transform turkey s insular , rigid and intolerant political culture some might view these proposals as a sign of turkey s regression from an openminded , secular past , initiated some 90 years ago by the republic s founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , to a dogmatic islamist era spearheaded by mr erdogan but it would be more accurate to say that turkey is merely replacing one official dogma with another like mr erdogan , ataturk devalued critical thinking , preferring citizens to accept the truths he decreed as an allknowing leader during his singleparty rule from 1923 to 1938 , ataturk tried to reshape the nation according to his kemalist ideology , making sweeping reforms in culture , religion , education , language and science some facets of the kemalist program were relatively eccentric like ataturk s pseudoscientific thesis that prehistoric turks in central asia were the progenitors of human civilization today , after over a decade as prime minister and with plans for at least another decade in power as president , mr erdogan seems to be embarking on a similar mission of nationreshaping he is using a language and symbolism that is increasingly similar to ataturk s like ataturk , he is attempting to teach his people the correct version of their history and , like ataturk s , his political opponents are branded as traitors the big difference , however , is ideology ataturk was a secular nationalist who wanted to westernize turkey \( it was ataturk who abolished the ottoman language , in favor of a more modern , latinized turkish \) mr erdogan is a conservative muslim nationalist who sees westernization as a historic mistake but was n't mr erdogan the same leader who once put turkey on a path toward european union membership \? that was certainly the case during the initial phase of rule by his justice and development party , or akp , from 2002 to 2010 at the time , turkey was under the thumb of kemalist generals who threatened elected politicians hence , the european union , and its liberal democracy , looked like a savior for mr erdogan yet once the military was subdued , the incentive to europeanize began to fade now mr erdogan even appears to be convinced of a great western conspiracy to topple his rule a supra intellect none other than the united states , according to some of his supporters in the media that manipulates the middle east and creates trouble for the glorious new turkey the irony is that despite all this antiwestern rhetoric in domestic politics , turkey remains a member of nato ankara still welcomes western leaders and mr erdogan vowed , just last month , to strengthen the strategic partnership between turkey and america the deeper trouble is that while mr erdogan s muslim nationalism may boost turkish selfconfidence , it risks depriving the next generation of the skills they will need to succeed in a global economy sure , turkey boasts some success stories like turkish airlines , which is frequently ranked europe s best but it still does not have a highly skilled , creative or innovative workforce to raise the latter , turkey needs a much more globalist approach to education , and stronger commitments to the rule of law and meritocratic advancement \( the lack of which is rightly recognized by prime minister ahmet davutoglu \) the masters of the new turkey must curb their lust for power and control and help build an open society that rewards talent if they do n't , they will go down in history as a poor imitation of the kemalist old turkey they have criticized for decades with their own official dogma , cult of personality , and endless witch hunts for enemies within and turkey will not move forward , but will fall into the vicious cycle once outlined by the great medieval muslim historian ibn khaldun conquerors of a system eventually adopt the habits of that system hope for change lies only in newcomers from the wilderness
six years after the financial meltdown there is once again talk about market bubbles are stocks succumbing to exuberance \? is real estate \? we thought we had exorcised these demons it is therefore with something close to despair that we ask what is it about risk taking that so eludes our understanding , and our control \? part of the problem is that we tend to view financial risk taking as a purely intellectual activity but this view is incomplete risk is more than an intellectual puzzle it is a profoundly physical experience , and it involves your body risk by its very nature threatens to hurt you , so when confronted by it your body and brain , under the influence of the stress response , unite as a single functioning unit this occurs in athletes and soldiers , and it occurs as well in traders and people investing from home the state of your body predicts your appetite for financial risk just as it predicts an athlete s performance if we understand how a person s body influences risk taking , we can learn how to better manage risk takers we can also recognize that mistakes governments have made have contributed to excessive risk taking consider the most important risk manager of them all the federal reserve over the past 20 years , the fed has pioneered a new technique of influencing wall street where before the fed shrouded its activities in secrecy , it now informs the street in as clear terms as possible of what it intends to do with shortterm interest rates , and when janet l yellen , the chairwoman of the fed , declared this new transparency , called forward guidance , a revolution ben s bernanke , her predecessor , claimed it reduced uncertainty and calmed the markets but does it really calm the markets \? or has eliminating uncertainty in policy spread complacency among the financial community and actually helped inflate market bubbles \? we get a fascinating answer to these questions if we turn from economics and look into the biology of risk taking one biological mechanism , the stress response , exerts an especially powerful influence on risk taking we live with stress daily , especially at work , yet few people truly understand what it is most of us tend to believe that stress is largely a psychological phenomenon , a state of being upset because something nasty has happened but if you want to understand stress you must disabuse yourself of that view the stress response is largely physical it is your body priming itself for impending movement as such , most stress is not , well , stressful for example , when you walk to the coffee room at work , your muscles need fuel , so the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol recruit glucose from your liver and muscles you need oxygen to burn this fuel , so your breathing increases ever so slightly and you need to deliver this fuel and oxygen to cells throughout your body , so your heart gently speeds up and blood pressure increases this suite of physical reactions forms the core of the stress response , and , as you can see , there is nothing nasty about it at all far from it many forms of stress , like playing sports , trading the markets , even watching an action movie , are highly enjoyable in moderate amounts , we get a rush from stress , we thrive on risk taking in fact , the stress response is such a healthy part of our lives that we should stop calling it stress at all and call it , say , the challenge response this mechanism hums along , anticipating challenges , keeping us alive , and it usually does so without breaking the surface of consciousness we take in information nonstop and our brain silently , behind the scenes , figures out what movement might be needed and then prepares our body many neuroscientists now believe our brain is designed primarily to plan and execute movement , that every piece of information we take in , every thought we think , comes coupled with some pattern of physical arousal we do not process information as a computer does , dispassionately we react to it physically for humans , there is no pure thought of the kind glorified by plato , descartes and classical economics our challenge response , and especially its main hormone cortisol \( produced by the adrenal glands \) is particularly active when we are exposed to novelty and uncertainty if a person is subjected to something mildly unpleasant , like bursts of white noise , but these are delivered at regular intervals , they may leave cortisol levels unaffected but if the timing of the noise changes and it is delivered randomly , meaning it cannot be predicted , then cortisol levels rise significantly uncertainty over the timing of something unpleasant often causes a greater challenge response than the unpleasant thing itself sometimes it is more stressful not knowing when or if you are going to be fired than actually being fired why \? because the challenge response , like any good defense mechanism , anticipates it is a metabolic preparation for the unknown you may now have an inkling of just how central this biology is to the financial world traders are immersed in novelty and uncertainty the moment they step onto a trading floor here they encounter an informationrich environment like none other every event in the world , every piece of news , flows nonstop onto the floor , showing up on news feeds and market prices , blinking and disappearing news by its very nature is novel , adds volatility to the market and puts us into a state of vigilance and arousal i observed this remarkable call and echo between news and body when , after running a trading desk on wall street for 13 years , i returned to the university of cambridge and began researching the neuroscience of trading in one of my studies , conducted with 17 traders on a trading floor in london , we found that their cortisol levels rose 68 percent over an eightday period as volatility increased subsequent , as yet unpublished , studies suggest to us that this cortisol response to volatility is common in the financial community a question then arose does this cortisol response affect a person s risk taking \? in a , my colleagues from the department of medicine pharmacologically raised the cortisol levels of a group of 36 volunteers by a similar 69 percent over eight days we gauged their risk appetite by means of a computerized gambling task the results , published recently in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , showed that the volunteers' appetite for risk fell 44 percent most models in economics and finance assume that risk preferences are a stable trait , much like your height but this assumption , as our studies suggest , is misleading humans are designed with shifting risk preferences they are an integral part of our response to stress , or challenge when opportunities abound , a potent cocktail of dopamine a neurotransmitter operating along the pleasure pathways of the brain and testosterone encourages us to expand our risk taking , a physical transformation i refer to as the hour between dog and wolf one such opportunity is a brief spike in market volatility , for this presents a chance to make money but if volatility rises for a long period , the prolonged uncertainty leads us to subconsciously conclude that we no longer understand what is happening and then cortisol scales back our risk taking in this way our risk taking calibrates to the amount of uncertainty and threat in the environment under conditions of extreme volatility , such as a crisis , traders , investors and indeed whole companies can freeze up in risk aversion , and this helps push a bear market into a crash unfortunately , this risk aversion occurs at just the wrong time , for these crises are precisely when markets offer the most attractive opportunities , and when the economy most needs people to take risks the real challenge for wall street , i now believe , is not so much fear and greed as it is these silent and large shifts in risk appetite i consult regularly with risk managers who must grapple with unstable risk taking throughout their organizations most of them are not aware that the source of the problem lurks deep in our bodies their attempts to manage risk are therefore comparable to firefighters' spraying water at the tips of flames the fed , however , through its control of policy uncertainty , has in its hands a powerful tool for influencing risk takers but by trying to be more transparent , it has relinquished this control forward guidance was introduced in the early 2000s but the process of making monetary policy more transparent was in fact begun by alan greenspan back in the early 1990s before that time the fed , especially under paul a volcker , operated in secrecy fed chairmen did not announce rate changes , and they felt no need to explain themselves , leaving wall street highly uncertain about what was coming next furthermore , changes in interest rates were highly volatile when mr volcker raised rates , he might first raise them , cut them a few weeks later , and then raise again , so the tightening proceeded in a zigzag traders were put on edge , vigilant , never complacent about their positions so long as mr volcker lurked in the shadows street wisdom has it that you do n't fight the fed , and no one tangled with that bruiser under mr greenspan , the fed became less intimidating and more transparent beginning in 1994 the fed committed to changing fed funds only at its scheduled meetings \( except in emergencies \) it announced these changes at fixed times and it communicated its easing or tightening bias mr greenspan notoriously spoke in riddles , but his actions had no such ambiguity mr bernanke reduced uncertainty even further forward guidance detailed the fed s plans under both chairmen fed funds became far less erratic whereas mr volcker changed rates in a volatile fashion , up one week down the next , mr greenspan and mr bernanke raised them in regular steps between 2004 and 2006 , rates rose 25 percent at every fed meeting , without fail tick , tick , tick as a result of this more gradualist fed , volatility in fed funds fell after 1994 by as much as 60 percent in to the cato institute in 2007 , mr bernanke claimed that minimizing uncertainty in policy ensured that asset prices would respond in ways that further the central bank s policy objectives but evidence suggests that quite the opposite has occurred cycles of bubble and crash have always existed , but in the 20 years after 1994 , they became more severe and longer lasting than in the previous 20 years for example , the bear markets following the nifty fifty crash in the mid70s and black monday of 1987 had an average loss of about 40 percent and lasted 240 days while the dotcom and credit crises lost on average about 52 percent and lasted over 430 days moreover , if you rank the largest oneday percentage moves in the market over this 40year period , 76 percent of the largest gains and losses occurred after 1994 i suspect the trends in fed funds and stocks were related as uncertainty in fed funds declined , one of the most powerful brakes on excessive risk taking in stocks was released during their tenures , in response to surging stock and housing markets , both mr greenspan and mr bernanke embarked on campaigns of tightening , but the metronomelike ticking of their rate increases was so soothing it failed to dampen exuberance there are times when the fed does need to calm the markets after the credit crisis , it did just that but when the economy and market are strong , as they were during the dotcom and housing bubbles , what , pray tell , is the point of calming the markets \? of raising rates in a predictable fashion \? if you think the markets are complacent , then unnerve them over the past 20 years the fed may have perfected the art of reassuring the markets , but it has lost the power to scare and that means stock markets more easily overshoot , and then collapse the fed could dampen this cycle it has , in interest rate policy , not one tool but two the level of rates and the uncertainty of rates given the sensitivity of risk preferences to uncertainty , the fed could use policy uncertainty and a higher volatility of funds to selectively target risk taking in the financial community people running factories or coffee shops or drilling wells might not even notice and that means the fed could keep the level of rates lower than otherwise to stimulate the economy it may seem counterintuitive to use uncertainty to quell volatility but a small amount of uncertainty surrounding shortterm interest rates may act much like a vaccine immunizing the stock market against bubbles more generally , if we view humans as embodied brains instead of disembodied minds , we can see that the risktaking pathologies found in traders also lead chief executives , trial lawyers , oil executives and others to swing from excessive and illconceived risks to petrified risk aversion it will also teach us to manage these risk takers , much as sport physiologists manage athletes , to stabilize their risk taking and to lower stress and that possibility opens up exciting vistas of human performance
there seems to be no respite for school children in malala yousafzai s home province of khyberpakhtunkhwa days after the 17yearold received the nobel peace prize for advocating girls' right to education , the taliban launched the deadliest attack in s history , killing at least 148 people , including 132 children , at a school in peshawar the people of pakistan are shaken , angry , confused and fearful the government just lifted the moratorium on the death penalty and yet the attack in peshawar will not be pakistan s 9 11 moment terrorist attacks against schools in tribal areas are an old story muhammad khorasani , the spokesman of the pakistani taliban \( also known as tehriketaliban \) , said the peshawar attack was retaliation for the deaths of civilians killed in operation zarbeazb , an antimilitancy campaign the pakistani military started in june whatever measure the government takes , the militants seem undeterred another , and greater , problem is that the pakistani government is fundamentally ambivalent about the need to eradicate all militant groups the national counterterrorism authority , the agency tasked with coordinating the government s antiterrorism policy and its implementation , has been largely ineffectual just this week a court granted bail to zakiurrehman lakhvi , the suspected mastermind behind the 2008 terrorist attacks in mumbai although prime minister and gen raheel sharif , the army chief , have promised to go after all types of terrorists , no such consensus actually exists within the government rather , pakistan s leaders want to keep at least some militants around to fight india and reestablish some influence in afghanistan even as the pakistani military was conducting its antitaliban offensive in north waziristan in recent months , it refrained from going after the haqqani network , an insurgent group that staged several attacks in afghanistan this summer , or the thousands of militants in punjab and sindh who the military thinks might one day serve as proxy fighters against india one popular narrative distinguishes these various terrorist groups according to three broad categories those fighting other sectarian groups in pakistan , those fighting in afghanistan and those fighting in india but these differences are illusive lashkaretaiba , whose primary purpose is to challenge india s control over kashmir , also calls for jihad generally its supporters leave graffiti in streets throughout pakistan calling for war against the united states and the west sipahesahaba , lashkarejhangvi and jaishemuhammad are revivalist sunni groups that call for the establishment of a shariahbased political system , but they multitask , too all are tolerated by the government jaishemuhammad , which is known to cultivate links with and the taliban , is allowed to run madrasas in south punjab and to produce literature that calls for killing religious minorities and burning alleged blasphemers hafiz saeed , the leader of lashkaretaiba , has appeared on television advocating jihad against india the party of prime minister nawaz sharif , the pmln , is accused of maintaining close ties with the leaders of punjabbased militants the opposition pti is seen as a taliban sympathizer its leader , imran khan , said at a political rally earlier this year that the taliban did not want to enforce shariah in the country at gunpoint , but wanted to liberate it from the us war , according to dawn , a pakistani newspaper the power base of the ppp , the socialdemocrat party of the bhuttozardari clan , includes rightwing politicians and their militant partners in the southern province of sindh more important , none of these political actors has the strength to challenge the military s policy of tolerating terrorist groups that are hostile to india the army s position seems not to flag even after taliban attacks against the children of military personnel it is simply too apprehensive of india s growing contacts in afghanistan , and thinks that having militant proxies in afghanistan is the only way to influence kabul s political future \( gen pervez musharraf , the former military dictator and president , has even blamed india for the killings in peshawar \) but this runwiththehareandhuntwiththehounds approach has allowed al qaeda to reinvent itself in the region the head of al qaeda in the indian subcontinent reportedly is an indian who trained in pakistan and afghanistan with terrorist groups friendly with the military when pakistan s leaders profess helplessness in the face of the country s militancy problem , they tend to bemoan institutional limitations pakistan s judiciary and law enforcement are not designed , equipped or prepared to fight extremism but that argument skirts the central issue , which is that the attitude of the power elites toward terrorist groups is opportunistic if pakistan wants to save its children from death and destruction , its leaders will first have to agree that the primary threat to the state is militancy , in any version
there was a situation with some bald eagles on the internet the other day the drama played out in a large , disheveled nest somewhere in minnesota , in front of a camera that had been streaming the lives of those birds onto the internet for the last two years maybe you were watching or maybe you d clicked over to one of the hundreds of other cameras set up around the world to funnel the realtime activities of various wild animals online polar bears , hummingbirds , sea lions , wolves , jellyfish , whooping cranes , wood ducks these wildlife cams aren t delivering the kind of cheeky , viral animal video that the internet is famous for the tiny hamsters eating tiny burritos  buttermilk the goat jumping over other goats but a weird genre of nonnarrated , unedited nature documentary that demands a lot more of its audience all they offer is a sustained stream of animals doing whatever they happen to be doing , which , let s be honest , often doesn t look like that much bison stand around in saskatchewan a beaver sleeps in its dam every blip of action every swipe a grizzly takes at a salmon in alaska tends to be offset by hours of moping and loafing often , you click on one of these cameras and there aren t even any animals standing in the shot we spend our days racing around an internet of buzzfeed quizzes and upworthy headlines and umbrage and porn this churning , digital machine , increasingly optimized to dole out quick bursts of dopamine and wring all the clicks from our fingers and still , loads of us also apparently like to keep a bunch of puffins open in another browser tab , just doing their thing last year , people spent more than a million hours watching the audubon society s three seabird cameras alone the decorah eagle cam set up at a bald eagle nest in iowa in 2007 , and generally credited , like a kind of avian sopranos , with giving birth to this entirely new genre of slowpaced , bingewatched prestige drama gets about a hundred million views a year watching a wildlife cam dials down the loneliness of office life , maybe or it fills those last , hauntingly quiet hours before the kids come home from school or it s a way to zen out or it s voyeurism i m not sure until recently , i d never given the appeal of these things much thought all i know is , as i type this , i am , according to the counter at the bottom of the screen , one of 556 , 749 global internet users watching a family of great horned owls sit in a tree in texas all the owls are asleep in any case , the bald eagle incident in minnesota started like this one thursday night in early may , people watching the eaglecam run by the nongame wildlife program of the state s department of natural resources noticed that one of the three eagle chicks in the nest was immobile it appeared to be suffering bald eagle chicks are endearing , but not , in any traditional sense , cute their unwieldy , disproportionate wings and legs wind up contorting into all kinds of crazy tangles when they lie around the nest \( go online and look for yourself , but to my eye , they look like coils of uncooked sausage coated in dryer lint \) the eaglecam audience had grown intensely attached to these young birds , though after all , many had been following them since their eggs were laid back in february the nongame wildlife program makes a point of not naming the birds but on facebook , fans had taken to calling the chicks snap , crackle and pop snap was the one having trouble the little bird couldn t get up to eat clearly , it wouldn t survive much longer by the next morning , the nongame wildlife program was bombarded by emails , phone calls and notes on social media , pleading with it to step in and get snap some medical attention many people speculated or at least hoped that snap was merely stuck in the muddy floor of the nest , and would need only a little jiggle to get free \( there was a good basis for this theory apparently , some eaglecam viewers also watch another bald eagle cam , set up elsewhere in minnesota , and two years ago a chick there named harmon had a similar problem \) the nongame wildlife program , however , had a policy to let nature play out and not intervene it doesn t want to compromise the essential eagleness of the eagles on its eaglecam in an informational video about the eaglecam that the agency produced , a public relations specialist , lori naumann , addresses this exact situation hypothetically we re not going to turn the camera off , she says we re not going to climb in the nest to try and save any chicks the agency had posted the video the previous day , only hours before anyone noticed snap struggling the public outcry , ms naumann later told me , was getting more hostile as the day went on it became hard to ignore at one point that friday afternoon , she found herself on the phone with a woman who simply couldn t accept the agency s refusal to help snap she was crying and crying and could not be consoled , ms naumann said meanwhile , ms naumann was periodically checking in on the eagles , via the eaglecam , and noticed that one of the adult birds had brought a dead female pigeon into the nest to feed its chicks ms naumann knows the pigeon was female because , once the eagles ripped it open , they discovered an egg inside and so they ripped the pigeon s egg open too and ate its contents it must have made for great television , frankly and yet , ms naumann told me , none of the people criticizing the government for its willingness to let snap die seemed to mind watching their birds tear apart a mother pigeon and her unborn chick so , she ventured , there was something contradictory about that the emails kept coming that day they were emphatic some were written in all caps the nongame wildlife program doesn t disclose the eagle nest s location , but a few people threatened to find it and rescue snap themselves finally , late in the afternoon , ms naumann got a call from the governor s office they were getting pummeled with phone calls , too , and wanted to know how the nongame wildlife program intended to play this a decision was made within a couple of hours , two utility workers got into a bucket truck and gently lifted snap out of the nest the chick wasn t stuck in mud it was badly injured most likely trampled accidentally by one of its parents it had a severely fractured wing and a systemic infection there was no chance of recovery snap had to be euthanized fly high and fly free , little snap you taught us humans so much , one eaglecam viewer posted a few days later on facebook the mood online was mournful , but grateful there were frowny face emoji and bulging pink hearts hundreds of people thanked the nongame wildlife program for listening to them and helping the chick , if only helping him die a more comfortable death the community of eaglecam viewers felt it had been spared a lot of discomfort , too thanks , one woman wrote , for not making us suffer watching it die i m not up for that learning experience ms naumann felt more conflicted she explained to me that wildlife advocates generally look at these cameras as a way to deliver wildlife to people who don t otherwise go out of their way to notice it a livestream of bears or birds brings nature to our tablets or phones with the longterm hope of eventually bringing us back to nature but maybe it s kind of backfiring on us , ms naumann admitted in minnesota , the public had managed to turn the eaglecam into just another app rather than appreciate what they were seeing on its own terms , they saw something that didn t feel right , swiped at it , and changed what was happening on the screen in truth , that isn t so different from how we ve always interacted with nature offline , too we manipulate and manage the world s wild things to reflect our ideas about what s right and wrong , about what belongs in nature and what s an abomination there was a time when america s relationship with bald eagles was less mushy and sympathetic , more brutal around the turn of the 20th century , eagles , like all kinds of other avian and mammalian predators , were being eradicated they were vilified as murderers and vermin they were imagined to be grave threats to sheep and small livestock and competitors for fish and game birds newspapers printed exaggerated stories of bald eagles attacking small children , blinding , disfiguring or even carrying them away in their claws , like a 3yearold girl named nettie in wilkesbarre , pa , in 1896 \( an older girl was said to have stopped the attack by stabbing the bird in the head with her hatpin \) in 1901 , the los angeles times described an eagle seizing a 6monthold baby the child s mother , emma goulding , reportedly chased the bird for eight miles on muleback , then climbed a rocky cliff toward its nest , deflecting attacks from both the eagle and its mate as she ascended , killing both eventually , mrs goulding found her baby lying in the eagles nest unharmed , then tore her skirt up , fashioned it into a rope , and rappelled them both down to safety by the 1920s , all this vitriol and killing was pushing the bald eagle toward extinction early conservationists , trying to warn the public about the eagle s predicament , found it challenging to defuse all the hatred that had gathered around the bird slowly , of course , public opinion turned in the bald eagle s favor for a variety of reasons , few of which had anything to do intrinsically with bald eagles the environmental historian mark v barrow jr points out that passage of the first national law to protect eagles , the bald eagle protection act , in 1940 , was partly a byproduct of newly booming patriotism on the cusp of world war ii and in the 60s , the bird became a sympathetic poster child for the new , pernicious form of damage that the pesticide ddt and other pollutants were leveling on the environment it was one of the first species listed under the endangered species act in 1973 even now , seven years after the species has been declared recovered and taken off that list , it remains protected by other state and federal statutes we love bald eagles so much that we ve swaddled them in a big tangle of regulation \( how close you are permitted to get to a bald eagle s nest , under federal law , depends partly on what sort of vegetation is growing in the vicinity \) and even death can t rip a bald eagle from that bureaucratic embrace if you happen to find a bald eagle carcass anywhere in the united states , you are supposed to pack it up and ship it to the federal government s national eagle repository , outside denver , which has been set up to collect and distribute dead eagles to native americans for religious use the process is carefully controlled those making requests from the eagle repository must file the appropriate paperwork on the request form , there are boxes to check for pair of wings only , 10 quality loose feathers 8 wing 2 tail and so on that inventory now includes snap the chick s body arrived last week , by fedex rip little one , read one facebook tribute to snap you are no longer suffering , so soar high with all the eagles at the rainbow bridge well , i guess so our relationship with animals must have felt so much more straightforward , and less mushy , when we viewed them in more strictly utilitarian terms a century ago , we had no use for bald eagles , and we believed they were a threat to the domestic animals and fish we did have a use for and so it seemed reasonable for us to kill them like crazy now , emotional and aesthetic values have overpowered those pragmatic ones when it comes to animals , we deal mostly in feelings feelings of tenderness , or empathy or fear or awe and in the bald eagle s case , feelings of patriotism too we began to love bald eagles , and so it seemed reasonable to protect them like crazy those feelings about animals are so much harder to articulate and defend than the old calculus of useful and not useful even the name of ms naumann s department , the nongame wildlife program , basically throws up its hands at explaining what , exactly , the kinds of animals it s responsible for are actually for all we know is they aren t game animals not the ones we want to hunt but the paradoxical upshot of snap s story may be that not killing certain animals is the way we use them now the need these creatures are satisfying is our need to protect them we have a destructive history when it comes to the natural world , and we all know more damage is inevitable maybe we latch on to the species we ve willfully not destroyed as proof of our compassion , and as living props with which to demonstrate that compassion again and again maybe it just feels good to know they re still out there , in some safeseeming corner of the wilderness and maybe that s why we ve pointed a bunch of webcams at them so we can check in whenever we want and keep watch jon mooallem is a contributing writer for the new york times magazine and the of a sometimes dismaying , weirdly reassuring story about looking at people looking at animals in america
philadelphia clambering upward in dim violet light , stepping from one glass platform to another , you trigger flashes of light and polyps of sound you climb through protective tubes of metallic mesh as you make your way through a maze of pathways you are an electrical signal coursing through a neural network you are immersed in the human brain well , almost here at the , you 're at least supposed to get that impression you pass through this realm \( the climbing is optional \) as part of your brain the largest permanent exhibition at this venerable institution , and one of its best that show , along with two other exhibitions , opens on saturday in the new 41 million , 53 , 000squarefoot nicholas and athena karabots pavilion this annex designed by , with an outer facade draped in a shimmer wall of hinged aluminum panels created by the artist expands the institution s display space , educational facilities and convention possibilities it also completes a transformation that began decades ago , turning one of the oldest handson science museums in the united states \( as the franklin puts it \) into , which typically combines aspects of a school , community center , amusement park , emporium , theater , international museum and interactive science lab while also combining , as do many such institutions , those elements' strengths and weaknesses that brain immersion gallery gives a sense of this genre s approach it is designed more for amusement , effect and social interaction \( cherished science center goals \) than understanding so i climb , but i'm not convinced i hardly feel like part of a network of dendrites and axons as i weave through these pathways i try , though , to imagine these tubes of psychedelically illuminated mesh filled with dozens of chattering children leaping around that might offer a better inkling of the unpredictable , raucous complexity of the human brain but i end up appreciating the ambition anyway , partly because the exhibition itself is so fine , and partly because sense stimulants have become expected lures in science centers they are like carnival barkers , addressing visitors who might , for example , find the introductory gallery here , with its humble plastinated brain or its model showing mri brain images , or even its elongated neuron of a , a bit staid the brain is more complicated , more astounding , maybe even more frightening than it appears so why not be thrust into this mysterious play space as you read a small , awkwardly worded sign the signal patterns in your brain code your thoughts , memories , skills and sense of who you are the question is how do you get from signal patterns to human consciousness \? this exhibition reminds us very quickly just how far we are from knowing the answer how is vision synthesized in the brain \? how are conflicting sensory data reconciled in the anterior cingulate cortex \? how do regions of the brain work together \? we 're not sure , is the recurring answer in a 2010 noted that the human brain is probably the most complicated object in the universe here , we learn that it contains some 86 billion neurons , each making connections with about 7 , 000 others in changing configurations and firing up to 100 times a second by the time you were 3 , the exhibition tells us , your brain had made about 1 , 000 trillion connections \( adults , i was sorry to be reminded , lose about half of them \) given this intricacy and the vast extent of our ignorance , what can be shown \? some evidence of interaction between body and mind can be made plain touch two protruding prongs with your fingers , and you feel them both touch them to the palm , and you feel them as one there are more receptors in the fingertips but what about more subtle brain functions \? the exhibition , whose lead developer is , the chief bioscientist at the franklin , uses an exhibition strategy that has become crucial in other museums , particularly the in san francisco it is related to the fact that when the brain is working properly , its operations are nearly undetectable by us but when it fails , when it is baffled , when it confounds expectations , those are when its operations become evident \( which is why brain injuries provide so much information about brain functions \) the most effective displays here surprise our minds with the operations of our brains a central part of the exhibition is a street scene saturated with illusions lines look crooked but are straight stationary objects seem to move large objects become small sit in a dark , fourseat movie theater \( the seatbelts puzzle at first \) and watch fred astaire dance , as all the seats seem to tilt and revolve a queasy unease takes over it turns out , of course , that the seats are stationary the surroundings and screen revolve \( if the information the brain receives is in conflict , we are told , you feel dizzy or confused \) or try to read this sentence that a demonstrator holds up i cdnuolt blveiee that i cluod aulacity uesdnatnrd what i was rdanieg all the brain needs are each word s first and last letters to make sense of the text it discovers meaning where there seems to be none another display shows that such discoveries can be based on expectations and experience you hear a spoken phrase that seems incomprehensible then the same sounds are spoken clearly \( you dropped your train ticket \) when the gibberish is repeated exactly as first heard , you wonder how you could have failed to understand or look at an animated stick figure walking on a screen sliding some controls can alter its movements , affecting the sway of the body or the swing of the arms , and these shifts take on emotional connotations simple moving lines start to seem nervous or relaxed , happy or sad in these cases , the brain leaps ahead of what the body senses , drawing conclusions they are sometimes wrong , sometimes subtly correct and sometimes extraordinarily imaginative some exhibits here are less successful , including those that offer discussions of ethical issues , where visitors are asked to vote \( if a drug could erase a day of memory , should people be allowed to use it \? \) and there are important aspects of the subject that are not explored medications and brain chemistry , brain injuries , brain research about the manipulation of artificial limbs or computer software but when the exhibition threatens to become too thin or abstruse , its themes are made vivid through interactive displays this stagecraft demonstrates the strengths of the experiential science center , particularly when it is able to hold at bay its growing and its broad embrace of , which hold more sway in the neural network playroom in two traveling exhibitions also opening here saturday , the appeals to sensation are closer to the surface , and , at least in the first , the scientific content is far less evident in science under the big top , visitors identify shapes of animal scat or read about the physics of the bungee cord but explanations are cursory , tacked on this exhibition s governing genre is the amusement park it includes a tightrope walk you can take in harnessed safety another exhibition , , celebrates creations ranging from paper to the world wide web it is billed as a unique , immersive , multiscreen media presentation , but since it was n't yet ready at my visit , i do n't know how well the content thrives amid the sensation but the possibilities of the new should n't eclipse the glories of the old that brain immersion gallery is meant to recall a 1956 exhibition that remains an enduring attraction here , according to the institute s incoming president and chief executive , larry dubinski it is a walkthrough , plaster and papierm ch model of the human heart as a child , i was amazed by its mysterious intricacies as i climbed through its thumping chambers , following the path of a drop of blood on a recent visit , i had to step aside a few times for racing school children i was clogging arterial passages the pathways of the franklin s wiremesh brain will surely become just as hyperactive but i doubt those webs of neural networks will have the lifespan of the papierm ch heart
los angeles when kyle anderson was in middle school in new jersey , he watched s basketball team , with players like kevin love and russell westbrook , who helped the bruins reach the final four , catching his eye now , with anderson a college sophomore , not only does he hope to follow in the footsteps of westbrook and love , he might even call them to talk about it players at storied programs have deep connections championship banners and legions of successful nba players are the ties that bind players at colleges like duke , kansas , kentucky , north carolina and syracuse at ucla , the connections may be a bit more personal , and they span generations it s one big family , said reggie miller , a 1987 graduate it s a brotherhood what separates ucla is not necessarily the 11 championship banners that hang in pauley pavilion \( the bruins have won only one title since 1975 \) and other programs have had revered coaches , even if none of them possess quite the stature of john wooden what ucla has that others do not is its location when star players leave for the nba , they often return to their college towns only on occasion but for many exbruins , and many nba players , los angeles is an offseason or postplayingcareer home la is definitely one of the main characters in being at a school like ucla , said baron davis , a former nba guard who chose ucla over kansas that s where your resources are that s where relationships are that build for your career and life a prime factor for me was after i'm done playing , i want to go to a school where i wanted to live that s la for decades , nba players have kept in shape with pickup games at ucla , at the old men s gym or at wooden center , the student recreation center when miller was in college , he sometimes found himself playing with or against magic johnson , larry bird and michael jordan , as well as former bruins he looked up to , like rod foster these days , it is not uncommon for pickup games to involve westbrook , love and other exbruins , along with others who spend time in los angeles , like carmelo anthony , james harden and dwight howard to have those players there , you 're just an 18 , 19yearold kid , you 're wideeyed , miller said in a telephone interview from memphis , the site of the ncaa tournament s south regional , for which he will be a turner sports and cbs commentator it was during those games that he got to know kiki vandeweghe , who had helped the bruins reach the ncaa title game in 1980 and had established himself as a scorer in the nba he and i would do shooting drills , miller said , but he 'd also talk about life lessons , about the pitfalls of the nba and expectations of playing at ucla although bruins through the years may not have had shared experiences , they all can relate to the expectations you do n't come to ucla unless you expect to win a national championship period , said tracy murray , a radio analyst whose senior season ended in disappointment when the bruins were routed by indiana in the 1992 west regional final if you fall short , it feels like you failed bruins of almost every generation have had mentors for bill walton , it was kenny washington , a role player on the late1960s team that walton idolized while growing up near san diego after walton became the first high school player to make a united states national team , he roomed with washington on a summerlong tour of europe he s still one of my best friends , walton said through the years , one former player has continued to make connections with players of all generations mike warren , the point guard on the 1967 and 1968 title teams , who earned acclaim as an actor on the television series hill street blues in the 1980s warren lives near the ucla campus and has been a fixture at games for years that was my guy , miller said warren was a steadying influence on portland trail blazers guard earl watson , a kansas city , kan , native who was away from home for the first time and he was an early influence on davis , the former nba guard , who played youth basketball with warren s son , cash that relationship helped steer davis to crossroads school , a small private school in santa monica , calif , known for its arts , not athletics , program it showed me basketball can take you a different avenue , said davis , an nba analyst on tnt , where he has distinguished himself with mock documentarystyle shorts about his plans to launch a comeback here s this guy who has won national championships starring on tv shows it really opened my eyes to the possibilities davis also remembers that when he was 14 , gerald madkins , then a starter for the bruins , would allow davis to work out with him and that others , like murray and darrick martin , would encourage him davis s teammates in his two seasons at ucla included todd ramasar , who would become his agent , and sean farnham , who is a broadcaster bob myers , now the golden state warriors' general manager , graduated the year before davis arrived davis , like others , has made a point of paying his relationships forward , providing a willing ear and whatever advice might be needed to anderson , the centerpiece of ucla s resurgence it s very valuable , anderson said of those relationships it means a lot that there are guys who have been in my shoes before as 19 , 20yearold kids handling playing for ucla in westwood it s a big deal this ucla team , which will play topseeded florida in a south regional semifinal in memphis on thursday , has an everyday conduit to the bruins' past tyus edney , the team s director of basketball operations , made probably the most famous play in ucla s history , to defeat missouri in the 1995 tournament the bruins went on to win their only national title of the postwooden era just as pooh richardson took edney under his wing , edney is trying to give players the perspective that others on the staff cannot there s an incredible bond , walton said there s nothing more special than being part of the ucla basketball family and i love this team you win championships with offense , team , commitment , style all the things ucla represents right now i could not be more proud or loyal than i am with this team walton s hyperbole aside , he is not alone
kissimmee , fla b j upton was having the most dreadful season of his career and his brother justin was in the same atlanta clubhouse , a perfect shoulder to lean on as he navigated through the unfathomable time but he did not seek comfort from him in fact , he did not reach out to anyone for help it was difficult , but i'm kind of a loner , upton said , his gaze fixed skyward as he sat in the dugout on a recent dreary day in training camp i handle things my own way that s just kind of the way it is justin is three years b j s junior , shorter and stockier , but in his face and the timbre of his voice , the resemblance is unmistakable the younger upton shook his head when asked if it surprised him that b j did not ask for his support when he dealt with hitting 184 and being benched in his first year with the , after signing a fiveyear , 7525 million contract nobody s going to help you fix yourself , justin said people take that a little too far , i think until something clicks with you in your mind , things wo n't go the right direction you have to fix yourself before anyone else can but surely b j talked to his parents , with whom he is close , about his problems \? no not his mother and not even his father , manny upton , who is known as bossman , and the reason his son melvin emanuel is known as bossman junior , or simply b j what could anyone really say to me \? he said none of them had gone through what i had gone through last year nobody could relate , so i dealt with it on my own but scores of people offered unsolicited advice and that s the problem , upton said , everybody wants to throw in their two cents all the time , and you start trying to listen to everybody and before you know it you 've got 100 people in your head and you 're trying to play with him telling you something and him telling you something , and you just kind of take it with you to the field upton , who was the second overall pick in the 2002 draft by tampa bay and made his major league debut at 19 , does not fault those who reached out to him now almost 30 , he feels he should be able to handle his problems alone braves manager fredi gonzalez is comfortable with not putting too much pressure on upton asked what would he consider a successful season after upton s disastrous debut with the braves , gonzalez said just a good , solid year something that he would have on the back of his baseball card , something that he s done prior to last year those numbers are pretty good in eight seasons with the rays , upton hit 255 with a 336 onbase percentage , and piled up 232 stolen bases with 118 homers when upton discusses 2013 , he does it with a dismissive tone , certain it was an aberration he said he let the negativity of last year go as the braves took the field for the national league division series against the los angeles dodgers when i started sitting the bench in the playoffs , he said , i went from starting to a defensive replacement then he made a vow to himself this wo n't happen again i know it wo n't happen again
london nemanja vidic is a hard man from serbia , known for his noneshallpass defense through eight seasons at  diego ribas is the opposite , a brazilian traveler in search of a stage to display his occasional beauty on tuesday , both did one of the toughest things in european soccer scoring the first goal to open up a tense and tight champions league match vidic had been doing his thing , organizing a manchester defense that time and again denied the greater attacking talents of bayern munich in front of 75 , 000 at old trafford but then , as big men do , the united skipper loped forward for a corner kick as the hour approached when that kick came in from wayne rooney , it was fired high and hard and behind its target , vidic but the serb rose high off the ground he somehow twisted his upper torso in midair and glanced the ball off his head , over his shoulder and inside the far post bayern goalie manuel neuer was entitled to ask why no german defender had gone within a yard of such an obviously tall man in the goalmouth bayern would complain after the game that it had done the overwhelming amount of pressing and attacking during this quarterfinal away from home munich is europe s champion for a reason its team balances virility with a passing rhythm that few can resist or break down and it has a fighter s mentality , too that is personified by its own big man , bastian schweinsteiger schweinsteiger negated vidic s strike within eight minutes when he drove through the united defense to even the score with a superb halfvolley from a knockdown by mario mandzukic later , schweinsteiger was dismissed from the game after the spanish referee issued him with a second yellow card for a foul bayern complained that rooney had exaggerated the contact by falling theatrically referee carlos velasco carballo stuck to his opinion , meaning that schweinsteiger is out of the second leg next week in munich , as is defender javi mart nez , who also received a yellow card on tuesday we 'll go out there to play the same way , vidic said on television after the game ended 11 in manchester they 're going to have a lot of possession at their ground , so we have to keep our shape but i think we can hurt them he might think that bayern s arjen robben , franck rib ry and thomas m ller will think that the united goalkeeper david de gea surely cannot be as defiant as he was at old trafford should bayern go through , this will be the last stand for vidic in a united shirt in the champions league it took him five seasons to score a goal in the competition , but in that span , the wear and tear , particularly in his knees , has become so bad that , at 32 , he has had to call time on his career in england he will depart for inter milan after this season club soccer is , in that sense , a revolving door for some diego is one of those nomadic brazilians who undoubtedly has artistic talent but never seems to settle in one place his career has taken him to brazil , portugal , italy and several stops in germany , and in january , he opted to go back to madrid in hopes of european glory summoned off the bench tuesday after the other diego diego costa broke down with a hamstring injury , diego seemed barely in the contest it was , predictably , more a day for the atl tico defenders they took no prisoners in all , six of them received yellow cards , and they seemed to foul lionel messi , andres iniesta and company systematically but not just foul the third diego , coach diego simeone , has atl tico so organized , so energetic and so stubborn that in three previous contests against this season , neither side could win or lose tuesday was more of the same , with the same score as in manchester , 11 the brazilian nomad , diego , struck first with a shot from outside the penalty area that surprised barcelona goalkeeper jos manuel pinto in the way that it rose , swirled and dipped suddenly beneath the cross bar many may say that pinto , the reserve for the injured victor vald s , should have stopped that shot because he got his fingertips to the ball pinto told reporters that he would watch the replay again when he was alone in his room , but his initial thoughts were when you concede a goal like that , a great shot that goes in the upper angle , all you can do is congratulate diego and congratulate the other goalie , the 21yearold belgian thibaut courtois , who remains on extended loan from chelsea at atl tico he made great saves , said pinto , and we did n't win because of him indeed , courtois was in top form diving here and there , high and low , he kept out messi and neymar and iniesta as much as his defenders kept them out by tight defense , high pressing and at times calculated foul play we were expecting that kind of game , bar a s xavi told reporters after the game we had the majority of the chances , but they did a good job one chance was taken it fell to neymar , whose finish was bold and brave but it was created by iniesta , who ran with the ball 30 yards out , spotted neymar s move between the central defender and fullback and curled in the pass that pass , perfect to within an inch and exquisitely timed , was as much an art as diego s shot for the goal out of a night of stalemates in two full houses , beauty prevailed
in 2003 , when the walmart heiress nancy laurie founded , it sounded like a whim yet , over time , the troupe earned respect by filling a hole in the market , commissioning work by rising european choreographers gaining buzz abroad but little seen here this is a valuable service , even if the effect so far has been to make new york dance audiences feel that they have n't been missing much the company has performed in its chelsea headquarters and at the joyce theater , but for its 10th anniversary , it has moved up to the howard gilman opera house at the brooklyn academy of music three programs sample five works recently created for the troupe , none awful and yet none worth seeing again opening night on wednesday featured the longest work , s orbo novo when cedar lake this piece in 2009 , it was a coup this indemand belgian choreographer s first dance for an american group alas , it was a disappointment , and it remained one on wednesday alexander dodge s mobile set huge lattice structures that the cast of 15 rolls to form walls , cages and jungle gyms looked at home on the big stage live music by the mosaic string quartet and the pianist aaron wunsch was classy and the dancers showed off highdefinition technique in committed performances but five years on , they still sounded juvenile reciting from my stroke of insight , a book by the neuroanatomist jill bolte taylor about her own stroke the text explains the difference between the left and right hemispheres of the brain , the left supposedly concerned with past and future , the right with the present when it comes to neuroanatomy , both dr taylor and mr cherkaoui are rightsiders , advocating the power to choose rightbrain thinking in order to merge with the universe and promote world peace mr cherkaoui s choice to spread dr taylor s firstperson account among the dancers is logically consistent but it s also obvious , as are most of mr cherkaoui s ideas underlining the reductive , polemical text with bald pantomime syncing predictably with szymon brzoska s score and mr cherkaoui s wet noodle choreography ever undulant , continually collapsing , heavy on floor work , weak on footwork has a tendency to leak energy with repetition , what is boneless comes to seem mindless it need not be so , yet the antiintellectual false dichotomies of find unfortunate echoes in the rest of cedar lake s brooklyn academy of music programs the exception is grace engine , by crystal pite , whose two works for the troupe are its best it s good news that she has signed on as associate choreographer , a smart choice for the future
it can probably all be explained by the hat , the indelible success of pharrell williams the hat , of course , is the signature that he wore to the grammys in january sitting atop his head as if it were pasted on with adhesive , the hat part cowboy , part park ranger added several inches to his height and several months to his cultural relevance with one small stroke almost an afterthought , given that he 'd bought the hat several years before mr williams managed to redraw himself completely that night , he was a performer , a winner several times over , including for producer of the year , and also a very slick , gentle disruption but that is mr williams in a nutshell taking an old idea , something that s been in currency for quite some time , and , with a touch of panache and a willingness to look slightly out of place , make it seem utterly new he makes the familiar seem idiosyncratic now 40 , mr williams has been producing and writing songs for over two decades , first a force in hiphop and rb , and later in pop after a brief lull out of the spotlight , he s been one of the most transformative music figures of the last year , with his hands on two of 2013 s biggest singles , robin thicke s blurred lines and daft punk s get lucky and now there s g i r l \( columbia \) , his second album as a solo performer it s intensely catchy and harmlessly empty , and succeeds largely because of mr williams s bravery at standing firm on territory no one else is trying to claim the sunny g i r l which mr williams wrote , produced and sung almost in its entirety reaches back to the utopian black pop of the '70s and early '80s , full of soft funk and cushy soul it s an overwhelmingly positive album , cheery in mood and instrumentation , as if mr williams knows something the rest of us do not take , which first appeared on the soundtrack of and which is nominated for best original song at the oscars on sunday , at which mr williams will also perform the song is unrelentingly bright , like a peek of unfiltered sun between clouds on an overcast day clap along if you feel like a room without a roof , mr williams sings clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth were you so inclined and certainly you are not you could watch the for the song , with guest appearances from jamie foxx , jimmy kimmel and the rap collective odd future , among others again , this is 24 literal hours of happiness , punishmentlevel glee and yet happy , which is out of lock step with almost the whole of pop music , reached no 2 on the billboard hot 100 mr williams may be the most prominent pop music figure to have identified a bubbling shift away from cynicism in youth culture , or he may be the first person to make adultcontemporary pop that actually sounds contemporary either way , he manages to tap into broad pleasures while coming off like a minimalist or an aesthete there are moments of musical ostentation on g i r l , but they are few instead , mr williams delivers a gut check of pareddown rb and disco with almost military rigor lost queen is among the highlights a virtual lullaby , with nods to dancefloor strings pulse vibrantly through gust of wind , gush and marilyn monroe i know who you are has the faintest contour of loversrock reggae , with alicia keys singing dully about empowerment \( in fairness , ms keys s voice was not built for subtlety \) brand new , with its wanton jackson 5 horn homage , shows that mr williams has n't been too troubled by the lawsuit filed by the heirs of marvin gaye , who alleged that was too derivative of mr gaye s work without proper remuneration justin timberlake sings on this song , and mr williams manages to deemphasize him , turning an unfair vocal fight into a clear victory for mr williams none of the ideas on these songs are original , but they are for the most part out of fashion , and therefore mr williams s boldness and facility with them feels refreshing the album is a light massage , fingertips gently brushing your back , a reminder of deeper and more nuanced pleasure mr williams has always been a believer in sketches most of the genreshifting beats he made as half of the neptunes \( alongside chad hugo \) clipse s grindin' , snoop dogg s , and so many more were mere outlines , emphatic in their simplicity mr williams is an expert at pointing a listener in a direction , then stepping out of the way , confident that the rest of the path is clear in his music and his public presentation , mr williams glows with an incandescent calm that s part na ve , part smug where he is is the only place he can be and exactly where everyone else should be the most vital comparison point for g i r l may be its opposite , the other extreme black pop album of the last year , kanye west s yeezus , a stern album through and through g i r l is in many ways the antiyeezus \( though both albums have a dirty streak \) mr williams and mr west have grown up in parallel , though mr williams s ability to transform pop predates mr west s while mr williams helped set the table for mr west s avantgardeness , he has never craved it for himself instead , he s satisfied with being contemporary pop s great reconciler he has worked with britney spears , mystikal and hans zimmer he was a spirit guide for miley cyrus during her recent transition from countryinclined postdisney upstart to salacious pop phenom mr williams produced a pair of songs on her album bangerz \( rca \) , and she returns the favor here with guest vocals on come get it bae as a performer , mr williams is a true chameleon , but he has no natural home he s a tremendous accent piece , but can you build a room around him \? he has a neutral , almost ahistoric voice he s not a powerful singer so many times on this album , his vocals are thickened , bolstered with harmonies , and so on his tone is unmistakable , but his force is on loan and there s nothing gnomic about his lyrics coming from almost anyone else , they 'd be pilloried for excess simplicity plenty of times on this album , he sings lines that are vexing duck dynasty' is cool and all but they got nothing on the female s call , on hunter on marilyn monroe , he sings lyrics that sound like we cannot help who we 're attracted to so let s all dance and elevate each other instead , where mr williams excels is in pacing and rhythm , and finding pockets of delivery that feel intuitive , or at least lined so deeply with historical memory that they 're instantly familiar and comforting he sings in a percussive manner , full of vocal stabs , and his voice congeals easily into a sweet coo , precise and seemingly effortless mr williams has released one other solo album in my mind \( star trak interscope \) , in 2006 this was a different pharrell mostly a rapper , a wry braggart , bawdy and thrilled to get away with it he had n't yet transcended category but mr williams has shifted the culture in a fashion similar to g i r l once before as the neptunes were reaching their commercial peak as pop and hiphop producers , they chose to spend that clout by effectively reformatting \( with the addition of a vocalist \) into a rock band , the debut nerd album , in searchof \( virgin \) , originally released in 2001 , was a brilliant hodgepodge of rock , soul , electro , hiphop and more , the tablet on which mr williams laid out his polyglot vision it had no clear precursor , and no clear peers and though it was n't a breakthrough commercial success , it s been a quiet influence in the years since like g i r l , and like that hat , that , too , was something dug out from the back of the closet , a backward look that turned out to be the way forward
auchterarder , scotland with one struggle concluded and another set to begin , this ancient slategray town in the russetleaved approaches to the scottish highlands has been busy in recent days , swapping the political passions of last week for the breezier enthusiasms involved in preparing for what many local residents regard as the greatest sporting event ever to be staged in scotland with days to go before the first round of the ryder cup at gleneagles , a golf resort three miles from auchterarder , townspeople have chosen to move beyond the divisive feelings stirred by on whether scotland should break its bond with britain and retake the independence it lost in the acts of union of 1707 fifty miles southwest , in glasgow one of only four districts in the 32 across scotland that voted to secede festering resentments on friday in auchterarder , though , there has been nae bother in the wake of the vote , as some here expressed it perth and kinross , the central belt region that includes auchterarder , was one of the districts that voted most strongly to reject independence , 602 percent to 398 the margin across scotland was 106 percentage points in the aftermath of the referendum , what many here refer to as the cleanup has progressed from taking down political emblems to grooming sidewalks and touching up the paint of local hotels , which sold out all their rooms months ago , as did almost all the hotels within 50 miles of gleneagles 135 , 000 ryder cup ticket holders are expected to arrive for the three days of the tournament , which begins friday among business people in auchterarder , two words have been repeated at almost every turn since the referendum result came in it s over , people said , referring both to the vote and to its bitter divisions , as a visitor conducted an impromptu poll at grocery stores , bakeries , real estate offices and main street eateries , like cocoa mountain that cafe is run by carol wood , who is also the chairwoman of a committee negotiating with ryder cup officials over issues affecting the town these include creating a sealed ring around gleneagles for all but cupsanctioned vehicles , including the buses that will ferry in ticket holders from up to an hour away , and controlling through traffic on a nearby highway , which will be allowed into the town only on a restricted basis wood , who led a bitter fight on behalf of local companies against an earlier plan that appeared likely to stifle business in the town for two weeks or more , is more relaxed now we were very disillusioned , she said , describing a feeling that local businesses would be the losers in an event that is expected to generate up to 250 million in revenue for the european ryder cup organization and for other businesses directly linked to the tournament in gleneagles one story being passed around was that the owner of a local estate had struck a deal with visiting americans for about 170 , 000 to rent his mansion and its helicopter landing pad for the week wood said she was now satisfied that enough customers would be allowed to filter into auchterarder to keep local store owners happy but concerns have not abated among the townspeople as constable euan mitchell , assigned by police scotland as a community liaison officer for the months leading up to the cup , handed out leaflets over the weekend declaring auchterarder to be open for business during the competition , he was pressed by agitated residents who worried that they would not be able to walk their dogs , send their mail or go to church you 'll be fine , ma'am you can stop for as long as it takes to post your letter , he told one elderly woman who said she worried about getting a parking fine for stopping at a mailbox on a street where parking had been banned for the cup other concerns have been raised at auchterarder golf club , which has been forced to suspend play on its sixth hole for the duration of the cup after officials ruled that wildly errant shots by club members could cross a boundary fence and strike players and spectators on the 15th hole of the jack nicklausdesigned centenary course at gleneagles that will be used for the cup lastminute preparations have been underway across gleneagles every road and pathway has been busy with golf carts , mobile cranes and trucks fairways are being groomed and regroomed , with some of the tractordrawn mowers flying two flags one the united states' stars and stripes , the other the blue flag of ryder cup europe the marquees , too , have a nonpartisan air , with one inscription , 30 feet high , quoting tom watson , the 65yearold captain of the american team , on his delight at serving as a ryder cup captain for a second time , after his victory as captain in 1993 watson s five victories in the british open four of them on scottish courses , although none at gleneagles have made him a hugely popular figure among visitors , both european and american , as he tries to end a run in which the united states has been defeated in five of the last six ryder cups although local bookmakers have made europe the favorite , the sense among many visiting the course in recent days has been that an american victory to redeem the team s loss at the last cup , in 2012 when europe won an astonishing eight of the 12 lastday singles matches at medinah , outside chicago , to retain the trophy by a single point , 14 to 13 would be almost as much of a crowdpleaser lapel buttons with watson s image have been even more popular than booster buttons for rory mcilroy , a 25yearold from northern ireland who will lead the european players since the referendum , nobody associated with the cup management has been prepared to say that there will be no instances of political celebration or embitterment among the scots and the english likely to predominate among the spectators no boisterously waved union jacks or saltires , no placards smuggled past the elaborate security net and no shouted slogans as the 24 european and american players stand over their strokes a precedent of a kind was set at wimbledon last year , when alex salmond , the leader of the scottish national party , hidden in his wife s handbag he waved the flag behind the back of the british prime minister , david cameron , as andy murray , a scot who grew up in dunblane , 15 miles southwest of gleneagles , became the first briton to win the men s singles title in 75 years murray set off something of a political firestorm on thursday when he seemed to end his equivocation about the referendum with that concluded with lets do this ! the message prompted angry retorts online from tennis fans who vowed to boo and otherwise upset murray in future wimbledon appearances , but the four english and scottish golfers competing at gleneagles have perhaps wisely mostly kept their own counsel on the independence issue perhaps the most notable declaration before the vote came from colin montgomerie , a scot who is among the most successful contestants in the ryder cup s history and who resides for part of the year at a home he owns near auchterarder an eighttime cup competitor , as well as europe s nonplaying captain for its win in wales in 2010 , montgomerie , now a regular on the senior tour , has a status , financially and professionally , that may have made it easier for him to speak out against independence but for all that , montgomerie , who is not part of the european team this year , took care to make his argument on strictly dispassionate grounds the potential dent independence might make in his fortune going independent would cost everyone a lot of money in scotland , he said in this summer who 'll pay for it \? the taxpayer and that s me , and i do n't want it
ascap , the performing rights organization that collects royalties for composers , songwriters and publishers , and the league of american orchestras , a service organization for the country s symphonic ensembles , announced wednesday that 27 american orchestras would receive the 201314 ascap awards for adventurous programming the awards are to be presented at a ceremony during the league s national conference , which is being held in seattle , wednesday through friday although most of the awards honor orchestras for , in general terms , including works that expand the repertory , challenge audiences and foster an interest in the music of our time , three are more specifically focused the albany symphony , for the second consecutive year , won the john s edwards award for strongest commitment to new american music , and the los angeles philharmonic won the morton gould award for innovative programming both those awards are 3 , 000 the san francisco symphony won the award for american programming on foreign tours that does not include a monetary prize the other awards , which orchestras apply for , range from 300 to 3 , 000 , depending on an orchestra s budget and whether it places first , second or third in its budget category among the firstplace winners are the saint paul chamber orchestra , the alabama symphony orchestra , the spokane symphony , the american composers orchestra and the laredo philharmonic awards also went to college and youth orchestras , and to three festivals , with the cabrillo festival of contemporary music in santa cruz , calif , taking the top prize asked whether it seemed odd that none of the orchestras formerly known as the big five the new york philharmonic , boston symphony , philadelphia orchestra , cleveland orchestra and chicago symphony were among the winners , a spokeswoman for the league said that those orchestras may not have applied for the award ascap and the league also provided statistics showing the living american composers whose music was performed most often in 2013 and 2014 augusta read thomas topped the list with seven performances , followed by andrew norman with six and mason bates and philip glass with five each
gaza city israel and palestinian militants in the gaza strip resumed crossborder air assaults after a expired on friday , but the renewed violence seemed less about meeting military goals than about jockeying for leverage in talks that had made little progress toward a more durable truce militants led by hamas , the islamist faction that dominates gaza , sent a rocket soaring toward southern israel exactly as the agreedupon pause expired at 8 am , and fired about 50 throughout the day , wounding one soldier and one civilian and damaging a house in the border town of sderot israel , which withdrew its ground troops earlier this week , responded quickly with airstrikes and artillery shelling that by day s end had hit nearly 50 targets and killed five people , including three children but israel showed no signs of seeking to reinvade gaza or escalate its airstrikes the cause of the fighting appeared to be hamas s frustration that it could not get what it considers meaningful concessions from israel and egypt at the talks in cairo the egyptian foreign ministry asserted that the parties had reached agreement on the great majority of topics and urged an extension of the ceasefire to address the very limited points still pending but palestinian officials said the israeli delegation had hardly addressed their demands to open border crossings , remove restrictions on trade , establish a seaport and release prisoners palestinian and israeli analysts alike said that after a month of death and destruction , hamas could not stop fighting without a tangible civic achievement , and was finding it difficult to climb down from an ambitious agenda in the face of a strong egyptianisraeli alliance the conflict on the ground between an advanced , hightech military and a guerrilla group appeared to find an echo in diplomacy , as egypt , israel and the united states all pushed for president mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority to take a leading role in running and rehabilitating gaza that would be a blow to hamas , which , and tricky for mr abbas , whose perceived cooperation with israel has already hurt his credibility among palestinians ahmed yousef , a former hamas leader who remains close to the movement , likened the renewed fighting to two people biting each other s fingers to see who would surrender first this is like a game , a chess game you have all the time to continue , to show your enemy that you stay strong , mr yousef said in an interview at a seaside hotel in gaza city for three days we could n't have a solid answer from the israelis , so you have to go back to fighting your legitimate demand is not answered , so you have to put pressure on the other side ehud yaari , an israelbased fellow of the who specializes in arab affairs , said , hamas is in a bind because they have set such a high bar with their demands but you can see today hamas and israel exchanged blows but on a low scale they were not firing all that they can , mr yaari noted everybody understands there may be an extension or a new ceasefire a senior palestinian official briefed on the cairo negotiations said that israel and egypt had essentially dismissed all talk of a seaport or restored airport in gaza , and only agreed to ease limits on travel and imports in exchange for these concessions , israel and its international backers demanded the demilitarization of gaza , something the palestinians said would come only with the establishment of an independent state as palestinians , we do n't want escalation , but it is our right to defend ourselves , azzam alahmed , a negotiator who is close to mr abbas , said in cairo we wo n't stay here indefinitely , he added , referring to the talks kobi michael , former head of the palestinian desk at israel s strategic affairs ministry , said the negotiations so far had proved a very humiliating treatment of hamas by egypt the country s new president , abdel fattah elsisi , views hamas as an enemy because it sprang from his main domestic rival , the muslim brotherhood egypt s role is critical not only as a broker of the talks , but because it controls gaza s gateway to the world , the rafah border crossing , which has been closed much of the past year cairo has indicated that having mr abbas s security forces back on the border , as they were before hamas wrested control of gaza in 2007 , would be required to get it reopened the egyptians do n't bother with political correctness they are very direct , mr michael said the egyptians have a long memory , and like to serve up revenge cold except for the weapons so central to its identity , hamas has little to offer at the bargaining table renewing the rocket fire not only sent israelis scrambling into bomb shelters on another sunny friday it also returned the world s attention to the killing of nearly 1 , 900 gaza residents since july 8 , most of them civilians , including a 10yearold boy felled by a drone friday morning as he played at a mosque under construction near his home the day s exchanges , however , were much less aggressive than before the ceasefire an afternoon airstrike hit a gaza city home belonging to a hamas leader , mahmoud alzahar , injuring three , witnesses said a strike in al qarara , a village near khan younis , killed three cousins , ages 10 , 12 and 22 , who were in a crowd of people waiting outside a grocery store to fill bottles with clean water the israeli military reported that two rockets were fired into southern israel even before the ceasefire expired , but the barrage began exactly at 8 am for maximum publicstatement effect the rockets continued for hours , but none went beyond southern israel , a contrast from a month in which a few sirens sounded in the tel aviv area most days this is not a worsening of the conflict this is a tactical move , and we need the perspective of time to understand whether this is also a strategic move , amos yadlin , a former head of israeli military intelligence , said on israel radio military hamas did not absorb a strong enough blow in order to have it agree to the conditions the egyptians and israelis are trying to force on it mkhaimer abusaada , a political scientist at alazhar university in gaza city , said that firing a few dozen rockets into israel was not , from a rational way of thinking , likely to move israel on core issues it considers a threat to its security the audience for friday s display , he said , was really the beleaguered population of gaza , where whole neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble , displacing nearly a quarter of the 17 million residents , and virtually everyone has buried a loved one hamas is trying to send a macho message to the palestinian people that we bring israel to the negotiating table and we are still launching missiles , mr abusaada said the problem is , hamas is acting like a superpower we know that israel is the superpower , and hamas can only annoy the israelis , but hamas is not in a position to put enough pressure on israel to make concessions lt col peter lerner , an israeli military spokesman , called the renewed rocket fire unacceptable , intolerable and shortsighted a senior israeli government official , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy , said the palestinian militants have taken away the premise for the cairo talks an unconditional ceasefire but sam bahour , a palestinianamerican business consultant and political commentator , said the cairo process was inherently flawed because israel and the palestinians did not come to it on equal footing after 47 years of occupation the sheer use of the word ceasefire' is insulting it depicts an artificial symmetry , mr bahour wrote on the blog , even though reality on the ground is totally contrary pointing to egypt s border restrictions on gaza , he added to be conducting these ceasefire' talks in the capital of a country that participates in the siege of the gaza strip should be an embarrassment to every member of the palestinian negotiating team , first among them hamas
ridgewood , nj thanksgiving weekend in 1990 , i spent two hours at the loneliest place in the world for an obscure novelist the booksigning table at a waldenbooks in a suburban new jersey mall i sat at the table smiling like a game show host store patrons scurried past me , doing all they could to avoid eye contact i kept smiling i straightened out my pile of free bookmarks for the umpteenth time , though so far none had been taken i played with my pen authors at signings like this get good at playing with their pens i pushed it to and fro i curled my upper lip around the pen and made it into a makeshift mustache i clipped it to my lower lip , pinching said lip in an almost masochistic way , and was able to click the pen open by moving my jaw and pressing it against my nose you ca n't teach that skill , by the way practice at one point , i took out a second pen , rolled up a spitball , and then let the two pens play hockey against each other the rollerball beat the sharpie in overtime during the first hour of my signing , a grand total of four people approached me two asked me where the bathroom was the third explained his conspiracy theory linking the jfk assassination with the decision by general mills to add crunch berries to cap'n crunch breakfast cereal the fourth asked me if we had a copy of the new stephen king i kept smiling four copies of my brandspankingnew first novel waldenbooks knew not to order too many stood limply on the shelf behind me i missed the barcalounger in my den i longed for home and hearth , for stuffing my face with leftover turkey , for halfwatching football games in which i had no rooting interest instead i slowbaked under the fluorescent waldenbooks lights , the early hipster booksellers glaring at me as though i was some kind of pedantic squatter i had become the literary equivalent of a poster child you could buy his book or you could turn the page time did n't just pass slowly it seemed to be moonwalking backward then , with maybe 15 minutes left before i could scrape up the scraps of my dignity and head home , an old man shuffled toward me he wiped his nose with what i hoped was a beige hankie his eyes were runny odds were this was going to be a where sthebathroom question , but this guy had all the makings of another conspiracy theorist the old man s gaze drifted over my shoulder what s that like \? excuse me \? that s your novel , right \? he gestured at the four books on the shelf behind me right , i said he shook his head in awe that s my dream , man seeing my book on a shelf in a bookstore he lowered his gaze and met my eye so what s that like \? i paused , letting the question sink in , but before i could reply , the old man lifted his eyes back to the bookshelf , smiled , and shook his head again lucky , he said , before turning and walking away he did n't buy a book he did n't have to
cairo last month , on the third anniversary of the revolution of jan 25 that led to the ouster of president hosni mubarak , millions of egyptians came out onto the streets carrying egyptian flags and pictures of gen abdulfattah elsisi , the army leader whom they considered their hero for siding with the will of the people and overthrowing the muslim brotherhood government in june at the same time , supporters of the brotherhood s deposed president , mohamed morsi , continued their confrontations with the police , which resulted in 49 deaths and scores of injuries there was a third position taken by some of the young revolutionaries who played a role in ending brotherhood rule last year , but were terrified at the prospect of the return of the police state they had opposed when mr mubarak was in power two such people are khaled elsayed , 30 , and nagy kamel , 27 , both engineers , who helped organize a demonstration against both a return of the brotherhood and the mubarakstyle regime the demonstration had hardly started before it was set upon by the police , reportedly using tear gas and live ammunition , causing the demonstrators to flee for their lives after the protesters were dispersed , mr sayed and mr kamel went for lunch in the city center , where they were picked up and placed under arrest by the secret police , who charged them with possession of bombs for use in terrorist attacks prosecutors ordered both men to be held in custody for 15 days , pending investigation what happened to these two men is just one episode in a long series that has targeted young revolutionaries some have been sentenced to three years in prison just for organizing a peaceful demonstration without prior authorization these sentences are based on the law on demonstrations issued by the transitional government on nov 24 , which has been widely criticized and has led several human rights organizations to issue a joint statement of protest the statement noted that the law had been promulgated by an unelected government with no legislative authority , that it put unreasonable strictures on the right to peaceful assembly , and that it empowered the police to use lethal firepower such oppressive measures previously met with stiff resistance , but now they are used on a daily basis and few egyptians raise much of a voice in protest this change of stance has a number of explanations first , since mr morsi was deposed , terrorists have been carrying out armed attacks and car bombings against the army , the police and churches , causing hundreds of fatalities among both military personnel and civilians this campaign has led most egyptians to give their support to the state in its fight against terrorism and to turn a blind eye to excesses committed by the security apparatus second , the standard of living in egypt three years after the revolution has deteriorated to the point where it is worse now than it was under mr mubarak many egyptians long for the reimposition of security and an improvement in the economy at any price the third reason is a systematic media campaign carried out by state television and the private channels owned by businessmen who used to back the mubarak regime this public relations effort aims to convey the notion that the january 2011 revolution was a plot by american intelligence agencies to remove mr mubarak it accuses the young revolutionaries of being traitors and paid agents of the west the campaign to discredit the activists has not provided any conclusive evidence , but it has had the effect of reducing their popularity to the extent that some wellknown dissidents have been attacked by ordinary citizens last month , when a prominent activist , esraa abdel fattah , went to vote in the referendum on the new constitution , she was surrounded by women who forcibly ejected her from the voting station to shouts of enemy agent and traitor this is a tragic turn of events those young revolutionaries stood up to the giant machine of oppression that was the mubarak regime they resisted the previous military council and rose up against the tyranny of the muslim brotherhood they carried aloft the corpses of their comrades , shot by the police they sacrificed so much to restore freedom and dignity for precisely those egyptians who now accuse them of being traitors a few days ago , someone posted a comment on facebook that went viral fellow revolutionaries , we have been through the three most beautiful and difficult years of our life we have tried to realize the dream but we now know that it has become impossible yet we keep on stating that it was a real dream , no matter how much they try to falsify history none of us who have lived that dream will ever forget , or regret it , for a moment as for those who have died in the service of the revolution , we say to you and your families that we apologize because we are not worthy of your sacrifices the poster s words clearly reflect the despair of this generation , a disillusionment that led many to abstain from voting in the constitutional referendum , which was approved by 98 percent of those who turned out commenting on the abstentions , observers have noted that it has made the transitional government uneasy egypt s prime minister has convened more than one meeting with representatives of the young revolutionaries it has also led general sisi to issue a statement confirming that there can be no return to the status quo that existed before jan 25 is the egyptian revolution over , as the frustrated young facebook poster declared \? the answer is provided by recent official statistics that show that the country s population has already reached 85 million , 60 percent of whom are under 29 it is these young people the majority of the population who made the revolution it is they who , in the end , will win out , because they alone are the future
chief justice john g roberts jr begins his 10th supreme court term next monday that s a fact all but guaranteed to startle those of us who remember as if it were yesterday the weird and intense supreme court summer of 2005 , bracketed by justice sandra day o'connor s unexpected retirement announcement and , two months later , chief justice william h rehnquist s death at 80 from thyroid cancer those events propelled john roberts , originally president george w bush s choice for the o'connor vacancy , to the center chair to which the president quickly switched the nomination at 50 , he was the youngest chief justice since john marshall of today s justices , only elena kagan , at 54 , is his junior it has been an eventful nine terms for the court and its chief samuel a alito jr , justice o'connor s eventual replacement , is well to her right and has provided chief justice roberts with a reliable if narrow majority for the court s steady regression on race and its deregulatory hijacking of the first amendment along with everexpanding accommodation of religious interests , these are the areas in which the roberts court has made its increasingly predictable mark anniversaries are a typical time for this kind of stocktaking , but what s most interesting about this anniversary is not the past , but the future the next nine years what kind of supreme court will john roberts find himself presiding over , and how will he respond to what is highly likely to be a change , in one direction or the other , from the knife edge on which his current majority rests \? nine years from now , chief justice roberts will be 68 , which happens to be the average age of the current justices nine years from now , there will have been two presidential elections , with a third election year just months away i hope this puts into perspective the tedious debate over whether justice ruth bader ginsburg should take a bullet for the left and hang up her robe i do n't intend to contribute to that debate except to advise the hyperactive 81yearold justice , who is giving interviews these days at a rate faster than i can keep up with the transcripts , that she should n't stay a day longer than she chooses to in case anyone has , quite understandably , come away from all the chatter with an image of justice ginsburg as an aging grandmother among a bevy of spry youths , i 'll just point out that both justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy are 78 , and justice stephen g breyer is 76 what all this means is that while the roberts court will keep its name , it will inevitably change its stripes but in which direction \? will chief justice roberts preside over a robust conservative majority , or will he be a beleaguered dissenter , left to watch from the sidelines as others build a jurisprudential legacy and deprive him of the chance to build a lasting one of his own \? these are not , of course , necessarily the only choices that may confront him assuming neither passivity nor helplessness in the face of political adversity , it s also possible that he could change his stripes along with the court that is to say that if the court s center of gravity moves to the left , so too could the chief justice migrate toward the center of the new spectrum , thus staying in the game and retaining the ability to shape outcomes this is a less cynical thought than it might first appear for one thing , almost any major supreme court case presents a range of options , narrow to broad , for reaching a desired result for another , chief justice roberts has already shown himself highly skilled at both approaches in contrast to justice scalia s my way or the highway and justice clarence thomas s fullsteambacktothe18thcentury , chief justice roberts is adept at modulating both his tone and his ambitions to fit the situation at hand the court s most recent term offers ample evidence the chief justice is certainly capable of writing broad opinions and of joining the broad opinions he assigns to others he wrote for the court in invoking the first amendment to invalidate aggregate limits on an individual s campaign contributions \( justice thomas , providing a fifth vote , would have gone further to take down the entire structure of federal campaign finance regulation , so perhaps the chief justice s opinion looked narrow by contrast , but it was plenty broad enough to do the job \) he assigned the to justice alito and joined in full the opinion holding that the government could n't require a forprofit corporation with religiously observant owners to abide by the mandate to provide contraception coverage as part of the employees' health insurance plan he assigned to justice kennedy and joined in full the opinion upholding sectarian prayer at local government meetings \( here , too , justice thomas would have gone further to hold that the first amendment s prohibition on the establishment of religion does n't apply to the states , a preposterous position for a member of the supreme court to take in 2014 \) on the other hand , chief justice roberts also wrote some important opinions that were sufficiently narrow to win the support of justices to his left while driving justices scalia , alito and thomas to refuse to sign his opinion they concurred only in the result while offering a much more sweeping analysis \( many endofterm analyses this year that celebrated the high proportion of purportedly unanimous decisions missed the internal dynamic of some of the most significant 90 bottom lines \) for example , in a 90 decision that struck down a protective buffer zone around massachusetts abortion clinics , chief justice roberts s opinion was joined by justices ginsburg , kagan , breyer and sonia sotomayor , but not by justices scalia , thomas , alito or kennedy what drove those four away was the chief justice s conclusion that the massachusetts law was appropriately content and viewpointneutral that is , it did not single out antiabortion speech for special disfavor but rather served the state s legitimate interest in protecting safety and order around the clinics the 35foot buffer zone was simply bigger than necessary , the chief justice wrote the decision left open the state s ability to enact a smaller zone , which the massachusetts legislature promptly did in his separate opinion , justice scalia fumed that the court had given abortionrights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the freespeech rights of their opponents and had preserved the ability of jurisdictions across the country to restrict antiabortion speech without fear of rigorous constitutional review justice ginsburg , in an interview over the summer with mark sherman of the associated press , praised the chief justice s opinion and explained her vote it was , she said , a good decision to say yes , you can regulate , but it is speech , so you have to be careful not to go too far' another of the last term s cases , , was closely watched on the political right for the longdesired opportunity it presented to cut back on congress s power to define the scope of treaties the case challenged the validity of a federal prosecution for violating a statute congress passed in 1998 to implement a chemical weapons treaty the vote to overturn the conviction was 90 chief justice roberts s opinion , joined by justices kennedy , ginsburg , breyer , sotomayor and kagan , sidestepped the politically freighted issue of the congressional treaty power and held only that congress had not intended to criminalize the particular conduct at issue in the case \( putting a toxic chemical on a romantic rival s mailbox and doorknob \) this behavior was a matter for state , not federal prosecution , the chief justice concluded , leaving congress s treaty power intact to fight another day describing the majority opinion as resultdriven antitextualism that reads like a really good lawyer s brief for the wrong side , justices scalia , thomas and alito accused the chief justice of having performed gruesome surgery on the statute in order to avoid the deeper constitutional issue in the case the opinion claimed an entirely made up relevance for the precedents it invoked , they complained in refusing to sign it the same three justices likewise refused to sign another roberts opinion , this one on a fundamental question of securities law in , the court ruled 90 against the plaintiffs in a securities classaction lawsuit the chief justice , joined by justices kennedy , ginsburg , breyer , sotomayor and kagan , found no need to overrule a foundational 26yearold precedent under which investors are presumed to have relied on the market price in deciding whether to buy a stock the precedent should be overruled , the other three justices said the question remains whether the chief justice s position in these and in similar cases in previous terms was the result of choice or necessity was he following his own best instincts , or was he simply trying to hold a court in the face of the untamed activism on his right flank \? i do n't presume to know any more than i have managed to unpack the enduring mystery of his vote two years ago to save the affordable care act will chief justice roberts evolve , as have other republicanappointed justices in recent memory \( think of sandra day o'connor , john paul stevens , david h souter , harry a blackmun \) \? would suggest the answer is a firm no among the justices who became more liberal during their supreme court tenures were none who had worked inside the beltway or paid their dues as republicanappointed officials in the executive branch john roberts , it s worth noting , has never left washington after arriving in 1980 for a supreme court clerkship he subsequently worked in the reagan justice department and white house and , before a twoyear tenure on the federal appeals court there , made a career in private practice arguing before the supreme court chief justice rehnquist , in his final years on the bench , seemed to have moved a bit to the middle in a few notable cases , and i was once in his presence when someone asked him whether he was in fact in the process of moderating his rigorously conservative views raising an eyebrow , the chief justice looked at his questioner and replied deadpan do you mean , have i shown a capacity for growth \? one man s growth is , perhaps , another s survival happy anniversary
from their inception in the 1890s , the modern olympic games have differed from other sporting tournaments \( the super bowl , for example , on which more later \) in the overlay of idealism that baron pierre de coubertin , the father of the modern games , concocted from the mythology of the ancient greek games and his own 19thcentury aristocratic sporting traditions never mind that his idealized olympic games have long given way to commercialism , professionalism , corruption , politics and boycotts the notion that the games somehow elevate the world above its usual sordid nastiness has remained an integral part of their image still , it was somewhat stunning to hear president vladimir v putin of russia last tuesday , in english , we feel truly joyful and positive because the mighty , inspiring spirit of the olympic games is once again returning to our nation the last time the mighty spirit visited his land was in 1980 , when it was the soviet union and the moscow games were boycotted by the united states and some of its allies over the soviet invasion of afghanistan yet perhaps some of that spirit was , in fact , back as the preolympic spotlight focused on the homophobic law mr putin pushed through last summer , or on the staggering 50 billion reportedly spent preparing sochi for the games which will be more than the combined cost of all previous winter olympics or on security concerns like previous presidents of the international olympic committee , thomas bach , the incumbent , was indignant at political leaders who , he said , marred the games with like not showing up to the opening ceremony but politics has always been an integral part of the games think of jesse owens at the 1936 berlin olympics , the black power salute by two africanamerican athletes during a medal ceremony at the 1968 mexico city games , the terrorist attack at the 1972 munich games , or the cold war boycotts in 1980 and 1984 it is difficult to imagine how it could have been different with the mighty , inspiring spirit back in mr putin s russia the united nations secretary general , ban kimoon , deftly wove the ideals and the politics on thursday when he declared that the united nations and the ioc were a dynamic global duo with shared values of universality , solidarity and nondiscrimination and then declared that those values do n't include any discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender or intersex people the bottom line is that the olympics are still one of the world s greatest spectacles and greatest tournaments and will dominate the world s attention for the next two weeks and i confess that the russians do throw a great opening ceremony , what with the girl lofted on high behind a kite , the floating islands of birch trees or the snowflecked shapkas it is curious to ponder what monsieur de coubertin would think of all this but it is even more interesting to ponder the good baron s reaction had he been in new jersey for the super bowl last sunday this greatest of american sports spectacles makes no pretense to idealism , gentlemanly restraint or bringing peace to the world this is an american game , a combination of intricate strategies , complex rules and brutal clashes that few in the world can fathom it s all about excess , commerce , noise , excitement and ferocity even the tv commercials , at an astounding 4 million for a 30second pop , get celebrity treatment , with their own youtube spoofs and chat groups i watched the super bowl on tv in paris , in french , and the announcer , samyr hamoudi , who had played football am ricain in france yes , there are some european teams made a heroic effort at explaining how it worked but then i suspect even american announcers had a hard time explaining what did n't work for peyton manning and his pathetic denver broncos from the opening flub to the utterly lopsided 438 conclusion the seattle seahawks were already at 220 by halftime , and early in the second half my brotherinlaw texted that he was switching to downton abbey on pbs , where lady edith learned that she had fallen pregnant and the party girl rose was caught embracing a black bandleader she had invited to the abbey as a surprise for lord grantham still , there was no loser in the end in the allimportant game of ratings super bowl xlviii got , with nielsen reporting that 1115 million viewers in the united states watched the game \( in france , i can confirm that there were at least four of us \) and downton abbey averaged 68 million viewers to top all antisuper bowl programs for the third straight year citius , altius , fortius there is a special sadness when a great performer dies young we become accustomed to seeing a star , a celebrity , an artist we read of their trials and loves as if they were fiction , and often they are and suddenly we learn that there was a real person behind the star , a person we never got to meet , who had real relationships , real doubts , real pain we accord them a special place in our cultural pantheon river phoenix , heath ledger , janis joplin , amy winehouse , jimi hendrix , marilyn monroe , michael jackson on sunday , one of the best actors of his generation , philip seymour hoffman , was found dead at his apartment in new york though the autopsy reports have not been conclusive , mr hoffman , 46 , was found with a needle still in his arm , and he had acknowledged struggles with heroin addiction since his death , there have been many articles about his life , his love of theater , his extraordinary talent none of them can fully explain why he used drugs , but they do give us some sense of the intense emotional and physical exertions required of someone who fully lives not only his own life , but the life of each of the people he portrays all who saw mr hoffman in different roles were astounded by how fully and convincingly he became the other person in a portrait of mr hoffman written five years ago in the new york times magazine , lynn hirschberg described how the 12yearold philip was profoundly affected by a local theater production of  when i saw all my sons , ' i was changed permanently changed by that experience , mr hoffman told ms hirschberg it was like a miracle to me but that deep kind of love comes at a price for me , acting is torturous , and it s torturous because you know it s a beautiful thing i was young once , and i said , that s beautiful and i want that wanting it is easy , but trying to be great well , that s absolutely torturous we know now how torturous it really was but it was a beautiful thing
during the melbourne cup carnival last month , john moore gave a talk to the membersonly australian club that he called the accidental trainer the moore name is one of the best known in australian racing circles , but it is on the streets of hong kong , not sydney , where moore never goes unrecognized he is the most successful trainer in hong kong history by victories almost 1 , 400 and earnings , with approximately 13 billion hong kong dollars , or 167 million he was there from the start hong kong s professional era began in october 1971 , and moore , then 21 , was part of its first jockey colony soon afterward , his father , george moore , one of the greatest australian jockeys , opened a training stable in hong kong and hired john as his assistant gary moore , john s younger brother by a little more than a year , had been riding in france and went to ride for his father in 1985 , john moore took over training duties from his father on sunday , hong kong racing which the moore family put on the map will be on display before the thoroughbred world as horses from various countries contest the hong kong jockey club s four multimilliondollar international races at sha tin moore will saddle seven runners , including the heavy favorite in the mile , able friend i 've seen hong kong go in the direction that i thought it would and that it is today a major racing jurisdiction envied by everybody around the world , he said with not even 800 races during its 83day septembertojuly season , hong kong s betting on horse racing of about 135 billion is larger than that of the united states , in which nearly 43 , 000 races were held last year in 2013 , hong kong offered average prize money of about 108 , 000 euros , or 133 , 000 , per race , the highest in the world beginning with dominant s victory in the 2013 hong kong vase , the last 12 months have been the best of moore s career he set a record for earnings with more than 1367 million hong kong dollars last season that figure rises to 160 million dollars if two other days are included sterling city s victory in the group 1 dubai golden shaheen in march and dan excel s group 1 singapore airlines international cup victory in may none of this would appear to be accidental , but until his late teens , moore had no interest in racing he attended an allboys anglican school in the eastern sydney suburbs , where he played cricket and rugby he spent little time at the races , although he lived in france for two years with his father , during which time george famously won the 1959 prix de l'arc de triomphe aboard aly khan s saint crespin then when he was 18 , a youthful act of indiscretion changed his plans returning home from a party one friday night , he pulled his noisy mini cooper s into the garage , which was below his father s bedroom my father , no doubt having a big race the next day , was waiting for me , moore said as i came to the front door , he was full of vulgarities he said to me , because you woke me up , you 're going to have to come to the track for the next month ' after three weeks of his sentence , a trainer asked moore if he wanted to ride at what they called picnics , a day for amateur races moore asked if there was any money in it he said you get a good sling out of it , moore recalled so i said i 'll do it on his first day , he had five rides and made 100 australian dollars he began riding in the picnics all over new south wales and queensland , splitting his time between the friday outings and a position on the sydney stock exchange then , after a falling out with his father , he decided to go france to stay with his brother , but first he traveled to singapore to visit an uncle who trained horses and was encouraged to visit hong kong arriving in 1971 , moore began riding as an amateur while holding down a day job at a shipping company meanwhile , sir john saunders , the chairman of the jockey club and of the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation , decided to professionalize racing moore had arrived at the perfect time his brother followed george moore , who died in 2008 , won 11 trainers' titles before handing the stable to his son gary won major races in england and france , like the 1981 arc , and continued riding in hong kong he later trained there and in macau , and recently returned to sydney , where he schools horses the stable buys in australia before sending them to his brother it is again a family affair moore s son george , 32 , is his primary bloodstock agent together they buy horses from europe and australia some as yearlings , like the australianbred able friend , and others already in training and bring them to hong kong , where there is no breeding industry last march , george and his sister caroline , as assistant trainer and groom , traveled with sterling city to dubai the victory was emotional , coming only two months after their mother , cheryl , died of cancer moore wants to continue tradition and pass the stable on to his son , but the jockey club s rules make that impossible but moore hopes for change until recently , the compulsory retirement age was 65 , which means moore , at 64 and at the pinnacle of his career , would soon be on his way out instead , the jockey club decided to allow a trainer five additional years , on a seasonbyseason basis , if he finishes in the top five in prize money it s informally known as the john moore rule if the jockey club can come up with a rule , like they did for me , that would say your son could come in as assistant , then away we go , he said then another moore takes over the third generation
new delhi india , the secondlargest exporter of overthecounter and prescription drugs to the united states , is coming under increased scrutiny by american regulators for safety lapses , and selling fake medicines dr margaret a hamburg , the commissioner of the united states food and drug administration , arrived in india this week to express her growing unease with the safety of indian medicines because of in quality at a handful of pharmaceutical firms india s pharmaceutical industry supplies 40 percent of overthecounter and generic prescription drugs consumed in the united states , so the increased scrutiny could have profound implications for american consumers fda investigators are blitzing indian drug plants , financing the inspections with some of the roughly 300 million in annual fees from generic drug makers collected as part of a 2012 law requiring increased scrutiny of overseas plants the agency inspected 160 indian drug plants last year , three times as many as in 2009 the increased scrutiny has led to a flood of new penalties , including half of the warning letters the agency issued last year to drug makers dr hamburg was met by indian officials and executives who , shocked by recent fda export bans of generic versions of popular medicines like the acne drug accutane , the pain drug neurontin and the antibiotic cipro that the fda determined were adulterated , suspect that she is just protecting a domestic industry from cheaper imports there are some people who take a very sinister view of the fda inspections , keshav desiraju , india s health secretary until this week , said in a recent interview the fda s increased enforcement has already cost indian companies dearly ranbaxy , one of india s biggest drug manufacturers , pleaded guilty to felony charges and paid a 500 million fine last year , the largest ever levied against a generic company and many worry that worse is in store if i have to follow us standards in inspecting facilities supplying to the indian market , g n singh , india s top drug regulator , said in a recent , we will have to shut almost all of those the unease culminated when a top executive at ranbaxy which has repeatedly been caught lying to the fda and found to have conditions such as flies too numerous to count in critical plant areas pleaded with dr hamburg at a private meeting with other drug executives to allow his products into the united states so that the company could more easily pay for fixes she politely declined india s drug industry is one of the country s most important economic engines , exporting 15 billion in products annually , and some of its factories are worldclass , virtually undistinguishable from their counterparts in the west but others suffer from serious quality control problems the world health organization that one in five drugs made in india are fakes a 2010 of new delhi pharmacies found that 12 percent of sampled drugs were spurious in one recent example , counterfeit medicines at a pediatric hospital in kashmir are now suspected of playing a role in of infant deaths there in recent years one widely used antibiotic was found to contain no active ingredient after being randomly tested in a government lab the test was kept for nearly a year while 100 , 000 useless pills continued to be dispensed more tests of hospital medicines found dozens more that were substandard , including a crucial intravenous antibiotic used in sick infants some of the fake tablets were used by pregnant women in the postsurgical prevention of infections , said dr m ishaq geer , senior assistant professor of pharmacology at the university of kashmir that s very serious investigations of the deaths are continuing , but convictions of drug counterfeiters in india are extremely rare satish reddy , president of the indian pharmaceutical alliance , said indian drug manufacturers were better than the fda now contends more rigorous enforcement is needed , for sure , but this impression that india is overrun with counterfeits is unjustified , mr reddy said but heather bresch , chief executive of mylan , which has plants in the united states and india , said regulatory scrutiny outside the united states was long overdue if there were no cops around , would everyone drive the speed limit \? ms bresch asked you get careless , start taking risks our government has enabled this for dr hamburg , the trip is part of a longrunning effort to create a global network of drug and food regulators to help scrutinize the growing flood of products coming into the united states , including 80 percent of the seafood consumed in the united states , 50 percent of the fresh fruit , 20 percent of the vegetables and the vast majority of drugs she has gone to conclaves of regulators from europe and elsewhere to coordinate policing , but indian officials have so far not attended such meetings many of india s drug manufacturing facilities are of top quality cipla , one of the industry s giants , has 40 plants across the country that together can produce more than 21 billion tablets and capsules annually , and one of its plants in goa appeared just as sterile , automated and high tech on a recent tour as those in the united states cipla follows fda guidelines at every plant and on every manufacturing line , and the company exports more than 55 percent of its production , said yusuf hamied , the company chairman but benjamin mwesige , a pharmacist at the uganda cancer institute in kampala , said in an interview in july that the institute had stopped buying cancer drugs from india in 2011 because it had received shipments of drugs that turned out to be counterfeit and inactive , with cipla labels that mr mwesige believed were forged he became suspicious when doctors began seeing chemotherapy patients whose cancer showed none of the expected responses to the drugs and who also had none of the usual side effects the drugs that had been prescribed were among the mainstays of cancer treatment methotrexate , docetaxel and vincristine laboratory tests confirmed that the drugs were bogus , and mr mwesige estimated that in 2011 20 percent of the drugs that the institute bought were counterfeit enforcement of regulations over all is very weak , analysts say , and india s government does a poor job policing many of its industries last month , the united states federal aviation administration india s aviation safety ranking because the country s air safety regulator was understaffed , and a global safety group that many of india s bestselling small cars were unsafe india s central drugs standard control organization , the country s drug regulator , has a staff of 323 , about 2 percent the size of the fda s , and its authority is limited to new drugs the making of medicines that have been on the market at least four years is overseen by state health departments , many of which are corrupt or lack the expertise to oversee a sophisticated industry despite the flood of counterfeit drugs , mr singh , india s top drug regulator , in meetings with the fda of the risk of overregulation this absence of oversight , however , is a central reason india s pharmaceutical industry has been so profitable drug manufacturers estimate that routine fda inspections add 25 percent to overall costs in the wake of the 2012 law that requires the fda for the first time to equalize oversight of domestic and foreign plants , india s cost advantage could shrink significantly some top manufacturers are already warning that they may leave , tough medicine for an already slowing economy i'm a great nationalist , an indian first and last , dr hamied said but companies like cipla are looking to expand their businesses abroad and not in india american businesses and fda officials are just as concerned about the quality of drugs coming out of china , but the fda s efforts to increase inspections there have so far been frustrated by the chinese government china is the source of some of the largest counterfeit manufacturing operations that we find globally , said john p clark , pfizer s chief security officer , who added that chinese authorities were cooperative using its new revenues , the fda tried to bolster its staff in china in february 2012 but the chinese government has so far failed to provide the necessary visas despite an announced agreement in december 2013 during a visit by vice president joseph r biden jr , said erica jefferson , an fda spokeswoman the united states has become so dependent on chinese imports , however , that the fda may not be able to do much about the chinese refusal the crucial ingredients for nearly all antibiotics , steroids and many other lifesaving drugs are now made exclusively in china
on the afternoon before my college graduation in 1999 , there was a ceremony for graduates who were getting department prizes my father was a new york city tunnel worker \( a sandhog \) and at that time he was working on roosevelt island , a 20minute drive from barnard s campus he always showered before leaving the job site , and on that day he d brought khakis , a freshly pressed shirt and tie and the new jacket my mother had gotten him for his 55th birthday i remember what he was wearing because it was the first time i noticed him holding a handkerchief , which he used throughout the ceremony to dab the corners of his mouth after , when we were discussing where to have dinner , i spotted a narrow river of saliva traveling down the side of his chin dad , i said , pointing as he wiped it away i felt a little ember of worry flare up in me , but about what , exactly , i wouldn t have been able to say a year later , he was at work several hundred feet below ground when he slipped and fell on the curved bottom of the tunnel he tore his rotator cuff and needed surgery , but we were relieved it wasn t worse he d been a sandhog for 30 years at that point , and had his share of scars when i was in grammar school he got caught between a screed used to level concrete and the platform from which the concrete was poured he ended up getting squeezed , as he puts it during that hospital visit , after looking at xrays of his deeply bruised hips , the doctor asked when he d broken his back never , he said , but the doctor insisted , pointing to a spot on the image that showed his spine had broken and healed how does a person break his back and not remember \? my mother still asks when the story comes up he always gives the same answer , which is that for some people it s easy to break something without realizing my mother and sisters and i love when he takes this position because it s so ludicrous imagine ! his physical strength was his currency , and when he wasn t working he kept busy around the house i d go home on a given weekend to find he d built a deck , or had cut down a dead tree and dug the giant root out of the ground once , because it needed to be moved , he crouched under an ancient piano and lifted it on his back while my mother shouted willie ! you ll kill yourself ! my sisters and i clapped and cheered only 56 when he hurt his shoulder and had to go on leave , my father expected to quickly recover and work well into his 60s , as many sandhogs do but there were basic things he couldn t do even three months after the surgery he d get one arm into his jacket while the empty sleeve flapped somewhere behind him straining to reach it , he d turn around and around like a cat trying to catch its own tail sometimes he d need help trying to bend his rigid arm it s my bad shoulder , he explained , but the doctor suspected something else he was told he had parkinson s disease , a progressive disease of the nervous system , at the end of 2000 , just before christmas i met him and my mother at the hospital , and stood with my back to the wall as the neurologist had him walk back and forth along a short hallway , tap his feet from heel to toe , touch his fingertip to his nose i thought it was a big waste of time until i noticed him struggling the doctor pushed him at the shoulders gently , but enough to raise my hackles and then watched as he staggered after , when we were seated in his office , the doctor told us he d known it was parkinson s the instant he saw my father in the waiting room the mask , he said no expression on his face are you sure \? i said i think that s normal for him everyone ignored me it s much better to know , my mother said later , as we walked to the car we studied my father to see if he agreed i reminded them that the doctor had mentioned new research , treatment methods to slow the disease s progress my mother s handbag was stuffed with pamphlets willie \? my mother ventured , and then burst into tears i think we all need a cup of tea , he said we braced ourselves for sudden change , but once he started a light dose of medication it was as if the clock had turned back we exhaled , marveled at how a few little pills a day could make such a difference he seemed younger , and we dared hope his case was mild then , as the years passed , we learned that though the drugs gave him a lead for a while , the disease always caught up he d be having an average day he d walk a few miles , tinker in the garage and then , as he described it , he d fall off a cliff he focused on trying to recognize when he was approaching the cliff so he wouldn t be left stranded somewhere far from home , unable to move then there were the side effects of the medication my father , to be sure , is not a talker it s not that he s bad at communicating it s just that he uses silence as much as he uses words and most people are too impatient to hear what those silences are saying so i shouldn t have been surprised when i accompanied him to a checkup in 2008 and the doctor asked casually about the hallucinations are you still seeing those men come into your room at night \? yes how many \? six , like always anything else \? they wear hats now and they keep their backs to me i think they re playing cards anything else \? sometimes that other man still tries to come in through the window after leaving the appointment , we d crossed the george washington bridge before either of us said anything so , i considered how to begin does mom know you see men come into your room at night \? yes i used to shout at them and she d wake up are you dreaming when it happens \? no i m awake ok i know they re not there to hurt me ok i know that now , so i don t shout but he did shout in november 2010 , when i was seven months pregnant with my second child , my husband , marty , our son and i moved in with my parents for six weeks while we were waiting to close on our house the first night we spent there , marty and i bolted out of bed around 3 am because my father was shouting at a volume i d never heard him use in my life my name is william keane ! he bellowed i come from ireland ! he sounded afraid , defensive , as if this information might ward off someone or something that had mistaken him for someone else i went into the family room where he now slept in a hospital bed half expecting to find a stranger pointing a gun and though his eyes were open he didn t seem to notice me there then he quieted down , a prisoner to his body until the morning , when his first dose of medication would kick in if he had an itch he wouldn t be able to scratch it if a fire broke out he might not be able to flee whoever or whatever was threatening him now was something only he could see i told my mother the next morning , expecting it to be big news , but without even turning from the counter she said that she d meant to tell us about that over the years my mother has tracked down every tool that might help him she , more than any of us , has set her will against this disease , constantly searching for ways around it , getting frustrated when the doctors don t do more , as if the cure for parkinson s is a secret they all know and are just too selfish to share when we remind her that he s actually doing as well as can be expected , she just doesn t believe it we consulted a neurologist who specializes in deep brain stimulation , a treatment where a pacemakerlike device is attached to the brain , but learned he s not a good candidate he has a special chair that can both recline flat and push him up to standing , grabbers on long poles to pick things off the floor , gadgets to help put on socks , shoes with elastic laces he s had a few falls that i know of , and probably more that i don t when he can t get his hands out in time he takes the brunt of the fall in his upper body , his face it s often difficult for him to eat , and one of my constant fears is that he ll choke because the muscles of his throat fail him but as his body gets worse he seems to grow more patient , more at peace the doctor always asks if he tries to leave the house every day , and i was surprised to learn that a lot of people with parkinson s don t bother trying to go out at all there are some days when that s all he does try to leave the house and if he fails all day he tries again the next he s never lost his temper about it this fall , my mother decided it was time to transform their narrow downstairs bathroom into a handicapped bathroom , everything wide and open enough for a wheelchair to roll into the shower and turn around it was a huge project the contractor had to move the sewage line and several times my father asked why in the world they were going to the trouble , especially since my mother was so stressed about it , dragging home heavy samples of tile , trying to find the right sinks and toilets we were all home for thanksgiving when she spread an array of paint cards before us and said that although she liked cool colors , dad liked earth tones so that s what we should consider dad , i said , have you ever said the phrase earth tones in your life \? my sister laughed and my mother got upset , accused none of us of taking an interest he insisted once again that the current bathroom was fine , and mom threw up her hands and shouted that a wheelchair won t fit in the current bathroom why are we talking about wheelchairs \? he asked calmly i m not in a wheelchair you re not in a wheelchair yet , she said what about five years from now \? jesus , mom , i said do you have to be so mean about it \? and then , looking back and forth between them him silent , her furious i understood that only one of them believed he had five years left there are more than half a million people in the united states who have parkinson s disease people don t die of parkinson s , they die with parkinson s they choke they have a fatal fall they grow weak and vulnerable to other illnesses for now , my father still has good days one recent morning when i was visiting , he sat with my mother to pay bills and balance their checkbook , a chore they ve done together every month since they were married his column wasn t adding up he did it again the pen he uses has a tubegrip that makes it several times thicker than a regular pen and reminds me of my sons first crayons writing his signature half a dozen times takes the wind out of him he ll turn 70 next month , and i hope he sees 75 , 80 , 85 i hope i wake up one morning and the top news story is that the cure for parkinson s has been found it s not impossible , i say nothing is impossible , he says when i told him over the winter that i wanted to write an essay about him , about parkinson s , he went quiet for a long time and i prepared to hear him forbid it i told him that if he didn t want me to , i wouldn t people would find it interesting \? he asked after a while , puzzled maybe a snow plow passed on the street he wouldn t be able to walk outside until the sidewalks were cleared of ice , but when he felt good he often stood at the open garage door for a while to breathe in the fresh air it seemed to revive him ok , he said remember to say i ve been luckier than most people is the author of fever a novel of typhoid mary
san antonio james michael mcadoo s most important contribution for north carolina was not his goahead free throw with 35 seconds left friday night it was the rebound of his next foul shot his quick hands kept the ball away from providence s scintillating guard , bryce cotton , and helped the tar heels escape with a 7977 victory that was an interesting one , north carolina guard marcus paige said that was fun fun , he said , only because the sixthseeded tar heels won which they almost did not cotton played every minute , because that is what he does no one in division i logs more time on the court cotton dismantled the tar heels , making 3pointers and feeding his big men and scoring and scoring and scoring , because that is also what he does in what north carolina coach roy williams described as one of the best individual performances delivered against one of his teams , cotton poured in a careerhigh 36 points , helping 11thseeded providence turn a 9point secondhalf deficit into a 7point lead with 4 minutes 34 seconds remaining a 136 north carolina run , capped by a 3pointer by paige , tied the score at 77 before a miss by ladontae henton gave the tar heels the ball and a chance to take the final shot before mcadoo s foul shots , williams turned to him in the huddle and told him a brief story at a golf tournament , someone told williams that if he made a particular putt six feet , downhill , right to left he would win 55 , 000 for charity i said , two free throws that s easy compared to making a putt for 55 , 000 , ' williams said so i was basically trying to get him to stop thinking about it so much mcadoo , a 537 percent foul shooter , said , i just felt confident it was a captivating ending to an east region game made entertaining by the stylings of cotton , who willed the friars to the big east championship last week and almost willed them to victory on friday his most electrifying sequence came with about six minutes remaining , when after nearly flying into the courtside radio announcers to make an acrobatic steal , cotton dribbled up the court , crossed over north carolina guard nate britt and swished a 3pointer in his face when cotton was asked to rate his game relative to the rest of his career , his coach , ed cooley , interjected aplus , cooley said he added i think today if there is somebody in this national tournament that does that , they would be considered superman that kid has been doing that all year it just was not enough to topple sixthseeded north carolina , whose inside presence proved problematic for the no 11 friars all night the tar heels spent all week concentrating on their rebounding , williams said , and on friday they pummeled providence on the glass , 4026 , and had twice as many secondchance points \( 26 to 13 \) mcadoo had five of their 21 offensive rebounds , to go along with his 16 points north carolina is by far the most decorated team at the eightteam group here , but also the most confounding among the teams the tar heels have defeated duke , kentucky , michigan state and louisville , all of which made the ncaa tournament among the teams the tar heels have lost to alabamabirmingham , belmont , miami and wake forest , none of which made the ncaa tournament williams attributed their inconsistency to a lack of urgency , one he could not necessarily explain on friday , he did not have to he could get by lauding his players and praising cotton , and just being gracious in victory said williams we feel very fortunate , to say the least
san francisco he wears sunglasses in the dark , talks about himself in the third person and has a bodybuilder s physique , but the minor character infiltrating this year s world series wears the uniform of neither the kansas city royals nor the  from the simpsons , is the alter ego of the giants rookie matt duffy , who has covered the knob of his bats with decals of the cartoon character as a caped cleanup hitter in game 4 on saturday night , duffy wielded his bat like a tourniquet and helped stanch the giants' bleeding after the royals scored four runs in the top of the third to take a 41 lead , duffy , hitting for reliever jean machi , singled and scored on a buster posey single to begin the giants' 114 comeback victory to even the series at two games each duffman , the faux beer pitchman with the big muscles , and , the realdeal infielder with the scrawny body , were joined at the quip by a california sportswriter at the long beach presstelegram when duffy was in high school the nickname stuck , so this year , while starring for the class aa , duffy ordered the duffman decals by the time they were shipped to him in early august , duffy had been called up to the big leagues , and so the package traveled from richmond to new york to milwaukee to kansas city , making more stops on the way to san francisco than duffy , a 2012 draft pick , actually did in the giants' dugout , duffy s bats fit right in on racks that hold other decorated wooden knobs , including pablo sandoval s congo de africa tribal mask design in the clubhouse , however , duffy stands apart if he did not exist , ' creator , matt groening , might have drawn him at 6 feet 2 inches , duffy is 170 pounds of bones , with a long , angular face and bushy eyebrows when he uncoils his body , he has more sharp edges than a swiss army knife \( and he has the same versatility , making appearances at shortstop , second and third this season for the giants \) duffy , 23 , is the youngest player on the giants' 25man world series roster and one of five rookies eligible to play against the royals but it is not his first trip to a world series involving the giants in 2002 , duffy attended at edison field \( now angel stadium \) , a 30minute drive from lakewood , calif , where his family lives he could have flown home on merriment s wings after the angels erased a fiverun deficit on the way to forcing a game 7 , which they won up until the day he was drafted , the angels were duffy s favorite team from scott spiezio s homer off felix rodriguez to troy glaus s gamedeciding tworun double , duffy can recall virtually every detail of the world series he watched from the stands but do not bother pressing him for details of the postseason in which he is an active participant he has gone through it as if in a china basin fog the night we made it to the world series , i woke up the next day and everything felt like i was waking up from a dream , duffy said it did n't feel real nearly 50 years ago , in 1968 , his family was touched by a major event , but unhappily his paternal grandmother was an executive assistant to pierre salinger , a san francisco native who was working on robert f kennedy s presidential campaign she was in the vicinity when kennedy was assassinated the night of the california primary i actually did a report on her in the fifth grade , duffy said i sat down and interviewed her with a microphone all these years later , duffy is adding a more cheerful chapter to family history entering game 2 of the national league championship series as a pinchrunner in the ninth , he showed great instincts in not getting caught off second on a linedrive out , then scored from second on a wild pitch to tie the game , although the cardinals pulled out the victory in the bottom of the inning according to major league baseball s statcast technology , duffy reached full speed in 176 seconds and reached a top speed of 203 miles per hour as he raced toward home it might be the fastest i 've ever run , duffy said i feel like i blacked out from about halfway to third until i got in the dugout i do n't remember anything he amended himself i do remember , halfway to home , i felt like i was going to fall on my face because of my forward lean , he said the seeming ease of duffy s ascent he was taken by the giants as an unimposing 18thround pick out of california state university at long beach is almost another cartoonish distortion , a sketch missing the weighty details that are the ballast of his success consider the speed he showcased against the cardinals duffy has spent countless hours and dollars working with rob nelson , a speed coach , to make his base path sprints look natural before , he was not running quietly , said duffy s father , tom , a contractor his mechanics were a mess actually , nothing has ever come that easy to duffy , who in junior high started making daily lists of what he wanted to accomplish during his waking hours to improve as a player before becoming a standout in the cape cod league in 2011 , duffy had to scramble for a roster spot before his junior season in college , he had surgery for a digestive disorder , lost weight , struggled to regain his strength and saw his draft stock plummet he was selected 568th over all , but he vowed that none of the players taken before him would outwork him duffy doubled the time he spent absorbing the lessons in his baseball bible , , written by harvey dorfman , a mental performance coach for the oakland athletics in the mid1980s the book , a gift before his first spring training in 2013 from a coach he met in the cape cod league , has writing in the margins , tabs on some pages and passages highlighted in marker on almost every page duffy , who hit an impressive 332 in class aa this season , said he had read it eight or nine times he carries it everywhere , duffy s father said , adding i'm always handing him things to read and saying , check this out , ' and it sometimes irritates him but when i saw that book , i realized he studies the game more than i realize on saturday , when duffy dug in at the plate for his world series debut , his focus was on the ball that s all before i read the book , i would focus on my mechanics in the cage and during batting practice and when i was up at the plate , he said now i just trust the work i 've put in and concentrate on seeing the ball and making the ball look as big as it possibly can and putting the barrel where the ball is before duffy sees the ball , he sees duffman on the knob of his bat it gives me a little bit of a smirk , duffy said i think it does definitely give this whole experience more of a childlike spin to it i'm able to relax and take it all for what it is
hutchinson , kan in his 40 years living in kansas , konrad hastings cannot remember voting for a democrat he is the type who agonizes over big purchases , trying to save as much money as possible he is against stricter gun laws , opposes abortion in most cases and prefers less government involvement in his life but when he casts his ballot for governor in november , he plans to shun the leader of this state s conservative movement , the republican incumbent , sam brownback , and vote for the democratic challenger he s leading kansas down , said mr hastings , 68 , who said he voted for mr brownback four years ago , when he easily won his first term we 're going to be bankrupt in two or three years if we keep going his way voters like mr hastings are at the heart of mr brownback s surprising fight for political survival although every statewide elected official in kansas is a republican and president obama lost the state by more than 20 points in the last election , mr brownback s proudly conservative policies have turned out to be so divisive and his tax cuts have generated such a drop in state revenue that they have caused even many republicans to revolt projections put state budget shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually , raising questions of whether the state can adequately fund education in particular this has boosted the hopes of the democratic candidate , paul davis , the state house minority leader , who has shot up in the polls even though he has offered few specifics about how he would run the state many disaffected republicans might give mr davis their vote because , if nothing else , he is not mr brownback there s just a lot of negative momentum behind brownback , and davis has been hammering that home , said chapman rackaway , a politicalscience professor at fort hays state university the governor s campaign has appeared so worried about his weak poll numbers that it took the unusual step last month of releasing an internal poll that showed the race to be essentially tied , hardly something that would usually be showcased in some ways , it is unsurprising that many kansas republicans have turned on mr brownback this is a state that once had a tradition of centrist republicans , like former senator bob dole , and has had five democratic governors over the past halfcentury but much of this moderation went by the wayside as mr brownback and conservative majorities in the legislature turned the state into a laboratory for the policies they had run on in addition to passing the largest income tax cuts in state history , they have made it easier to carry guns in public buildings , turned over management of to private insurance companies , made it more difficult to get an abortion , and made it harder to qualify for public assistance even some of kansas' staunchest republicans have found some of these measures to be too far to the right more than 100 current and former republican elected officials have endorsed mr davis mr brownback , 58 , a former united states senator who grew up on a kansas farm , has defended his record and is trying to force mr davis , who is from lawrence , home of the university of kansas in one of the state s most liberal regions , to define himself he s been mostly just hiding as a candidate , mr brownback said in an interview all his statements have been basically against me , and none of it has been what he would do the governor has painted mr davis as a supporter of president obama who wants to raise taxes and force the president s on kansans mr davis has hammered away at the governor s economic experiment , as he put it in a debate held at the state fair , saying it had left kansas with a vast budget deficit it s damaging our schools it s hurting our economy it s jeopardizing our future , he said mr brownback has also been set back by matters unrelated to lawmaking reported in april that federal authorities were investigating the fundraising and lobbying activities of some of his associates as election day draws closer , both sides can expect an even tighter , and perhaps rougher , clash , with outside groups stepping up their involvement the republican governors association has run television ads attacking mr davis and linking him to mr obama the brownback campaign s ads have sought to paint a rosy financial picture for the state political analysts expect , the conservative group founded by the koch brothers , the wichitabased billionaires , to step in , too the , a leftleaning advocacy organization , has run negative ads about mr brownback mr davis has run an ad that said mr brownback was taking the state in the wrong direction but he also had to pull one of his television ads after it was revealed that one of the actors had been arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute most criticism of mr brownback has centered on the tax cuts , which slashed individual income tax rates and eliminated taxes on nonwage earnings for nearly 200 , 000 small businesses the most recent fiscal year ended with state revenues more than 300 million short of expectations based on decreased revenue from the tax cuts , the state s nonpartisan legislative research department estimates that the budget will have to be adjusted by 13 billion , either through spending cuts or additional revenue , over the next five years in order to remain balanced opponents of the governor have used this to stoke fears that he would cut vital services both moody s and standard poor s have downgraded kansas' credit rating mr brownback said that the steps he had taken on medicaid , on bolstering the teachers' pension system and on cutting taxes had been needed to stabilize state finances , and that revenue growth would resume the tax cuts will attract new businesses and residents and , in turn , cash to the state , he said and because he has reduced the size of government and made it more efficient , he said , state revenues do not need to grow that much to fulfill budget obligations as promising signs , the governor and his allies point to an increase in the number of privatesector jobs since the tax cuts went into effect in january 2013 they also promote a record number of new business filings more than 15 , 000 in the state last year as a sign that businesses were attracted to kansas spending is also an issue mr brownback said he would not cut funding for education or other essential services , and since taking office he has increased the total state dollars that go toward primary and secondary schools by more than 200 million he has put tens of millions of dollars toward new programs for technical education and reading initiatives but most of the increase has gone toward things like teacher pensions and building maintenance when adjusted for inflation , state spending on classroomrelated expenses has remained flat , if not decreased slightly , each year , according to an analysis by mark tallman of the  so far , mr davis , 42 , the son of two teachers , has spoken mostly in broad terms about his priorities improving public schools and investing in work force training and higher education we know that if we have a highly skilled work force , industry will come , he said the only specific plan he has put forward is to freeze mr brownback s tax cuts next year and to appoint a commission to address tax issues i'm not giving people the illusion that this is the magic bullet that s going to fix the very , very deep financial problems that governor brownback has caused , said mr davis , a lawyer who joined the house in 2003 and has been minority leader since 2008 but i think it is a good first step ray merrick , the republican speaker of the house , called freezing the tax cuts a nonstarter right now , the legislature on both sides , house and senate , are on the side of the governor , he said the question is whether most voters will stand with the governor i'm not sure that some of the tax policies have been as effective as we 'd like them to be , said dianne blick , a 58yearold development officer from hutchinson , who has usually voted for republicans but is undecided in this race either candidate has to really convince me that they can create positive change and can work across the aisle
facing a twotime most valuable player with two on , no outs and a onerun lead in the ninth inning thursday , david robertson meant to place his pitch low and away but as he threw it , robertson said , he simply cut loose the ball ended up over the middle of the plate miguel cabrera swung , and robertson got a break a groundball double play one popup later , the , and taken three of four in the bronx against the imposing  i was just trying to be smart , robertson said i did n't exactly throw the pitch where i wanted to , but the outcome was exactly what i wanted maybe , in spite of everything , this yankees season can work out the same way they did not commit roughly half a billion dollars to new players over the offseason to be trailing in the american league east the yankees did not expect to have four injured starting pitchers and have nobody in the top 30 in the majors in onbase plus slugging percentage but if the outcome is a trip to the playoffs and the chance to make a deep run if things align as they did this week it could still be a memorable season , after all this gives us a lot of confidence in that we can beat anybody , catcher francisco cervelli said we 're still there we 're going to compete , and we want to be in the playoffs the yankees have not been more games above 500 this season than they are now , at 6054 it is an unlikely perch , given that they had to beat two cy young award winners , max scherzer and justin verlander , as well as rick porcello , a 13game winner this season , in the tigers series to get there thursday the yankees' starters in their victories against detroit were brandon mccarthy , chris capuano and shane greene mccarthy started the season with arizona , capuano with boston and greene with class aaa scranton wilkesbarre on thursday , the yankees' second , fifth and sixth hitters were all newcomers third baseman martin prado , first baseman chase headley and shortstop stephen drew prado made some nifty plays in the field , headley singled and drew doubled in the game s only run that makes three starters and three everyday players , none having played for the yankees before july \( except for a third of an inning by greene in april \) , all helping take a series from the al s glamour team if you went back to the wintertime and said , you 'll be able to get a prado , that type of guy , a headley , and you 're going to take a shot on stephen drew and move him to second base , ' i would n't have expected any of that , general manager brian cashman said it s just the way a major league season twists and turns the players were available , of course , because they were underperforming , expensive or both but even the moves that seemed easy , like or acquiring capuano for cash , were not you never expect anything , cashman said you have no idea where your conversations are going to take you you really engage everybody possible , including tampa on david price and boston on jon lester but you have no idea what ones are going to fit and what will lead you where i just knew it was going to be hard he added we wound up getting mccarthy eventually but it took us two months i had offers on the table they were rejecting it took a long time so i was not optimistic entering july because it took me so long to get a player who , at the time , was 210 it really dragged on cashman said he wanted capuano when boston released him in june but masahiro tanaka was healthy then , and c c sabathia seemed to be recovering from his knee problem capuano expected a better opportunity with the lowly colorado rockies , who never called him up from the minors he had an out in his contract , and i engaged dan o 'dowd , cashman said , referring to the rockies' general manager i said , if you 're not going to call him up , trade him to me' so i bought him the tigers and the oakland athletics stand out as the favorites to play for the al pennant in october detroit traded for price , and oakland traded for lester after acquiring another allstar starter , jeff samardzija , in early july but we hear all the time about how the best rotations rule october , only to forget what actually happens last year s cy young award winners , scherzer and the los angeles dodgers' clayton kershaw , combined to make four starts in the league championship series their teams lost all four games verlander allowed one run in 23 innings last postseason yet the tigers somehow lost two of his three starts the yankees would seem to stand a better chance in october if tanaka and michael pineda return but the yankees showed this week that if they catch a team at the right time , even as they stand right now , they have a chance cashman , though , was not looking too far ahead as he headed for manager joe girardi s office late thursday afternoon , he had more immediate concerns , like making sure esmil rogers was cleared to start friday we could make things interesting , cashman said but we 'll see we 've got a lot of baseball left we 're still trying to figure this thing out on a daily basis
our nation s immigration system is broken and our laws are not being enforced washington s failure to fix them is hurting our economy and jeopardizing our national security the overriding purpose of our immigration system is to promote and further america s national interests and that is not the case today the serious problems in our immigration system must be solved , and we are committed to working in a bipartisan manner to solve them but they cannot be solved with a single , massive piece of legislation that few have read and even fewer understand , and therefore , we will not go to a conference with the senate s immigration bill the problems in our immigration system must be solved through a stepbystep , commonsense approach that starts with securing our country s borders , enforcing our laws , and implementing robust enforcement measures these are the principals guiding us in that effort it is the fundamental duty of any government to secure its borders , and the united states is failing in this mission we must secure our borders now and verify that they are secure in addition , we must ensure now that when immigration reform is enacted , there will be a zero tolerance policy for those who cross the border illegally or overstay their visas in the future faced with a consistent pattern of administrations of both parties only selectively enforcing our nation s immigration laws , we must enact reform that ensures that a president cannot unilaterally stop immigration enforcement a fully functioning entryexit system has been mandated by eight separate statutes over the last 17 years at least three of these laws call for this system to be biometric , using technology to verify identity and prevent fraud we must implement this system so we can identify and track down visitors who abuse our laws in the 21st century it is unacceptable that the majority of employees have their work eligibility verified through a paper based system wrought with fraud it is past time for this country to fully implement a workable electronic employment verification system for far too long , the united states has emphasized extended family members and pure luck over employmentbased immigration this is inconsistent with nearly every other developed country every year thousands of foreign nationals pursue degrees at america s colleges and universities , particularly in high skilled fields many of them want to use their expertise in us industries that will spur economic growth and create jobs for americans when visas are n't available , we end up exporting this labor and ingenuity to other countries visa and green card allocations need to reflect the needs of employers and the desire for these exceptional individuals to help grow our economy the goal of any temporary worker program should be to address the economic needs of the country and to strengthen our national security by allowing for realistic , enforceable , usable , legal paths for entry into the united states of particular concern are the needs of the agricultural industry , among others it is imperative that these temporary workers are able to meet the economic needs of the country and do not displace or disadvantage american workers one of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents it is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own , those who know no other place as home for those who meet certain eligibility standards , and serve honorably in our military or attain a college degree , we will do just that our national and economic security depend on requiring people who are living and working here illegally to come forward and get right with the law there will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nation s immigration laws that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law rather , these persons could live legally and without fear in the us , but only if they were willing to admit their culpability , pass rigorous background checks , pay significant fines and back taxes , develop proficiency in english and american civics , and be able to support themselves and their families \( without access to public benefits \) criminal aliens , gang members , and sex offenders and those who do not meet the above requirements will not be eligible for this program finally , none of this can happen before specific enforcement triggers have been implemented to fulfill our promise to the american people that from here on , our immigration laws will indeed be enforced
a year ago , mariano rivera was the toast of baseball , celebrated around the league for his remarkable career in each city that he visited for the final time as a player , he would meet with stadium workers and fans in small gatherings hours before a game , and then soak up the adoration in onfield ceremonies to honor him rivera drew out the process , partly to say thank you to fans and stadium workers , and partly to revel in his final season as a player this year , it is derek jeter s turn jeter , the yankees' longtime captain , announced before the season that this would be his final year as a player , but his way of saying goodbye is distinct from rivera s , and uniquely jeter s mo s different from me , jeter said recently i play every day , so i have to get ready to play he got massages for five innings and then went out to the bullpen , so it s completely different the first three times jeter was honored in houston anaheim , calif and milwaukee there were brief ceremonies where jeter was presented with gifts , including customized , pinstriped cowboy boots , a pinstriped paddleboard and a bronze baseball bat none of the ceremonies lasted very long or involved lengthy speeches , and that is just the way jeter likes it not one to dwell on sentimentality , jeter has been respectful and appreciative about the ceremonies , especially appreciating their brevity he has already said he does not like the term farewell tour , but he added that it was an honor to be treated the way he has been the instant the ceremonies end \( the one in anaheim lasted less than 45 seconds \) , jeter dashes into the outfield to begin running and stretching in preparation for the game for jeter , nothing can interfere with his game preparation so far , the ceremonies have not the point man for these minievents is jason zillo , the yankees' director of communications , who fulfilled the same role with rivera last year rivera s events required extensive planning with jeter , zillo simply informs the clubs that he prefers a more understated approach his one stipulation is that the ceremony end 15 minutes before the first pitch so jeter can prepare for the game which led to the notquiteafarewell tour s stop thursday , in queens jeter , who went 0 for 4 , heard polite applause in each atbat and was doubleswitched out of the game in the eighth inning it was the last time he would play a regularseason game at citi field , his 88th and final game against the mets , unless the teams have an unlikely matchup in the world series thirtyfour of his games against the mets were played at shea stadium the mets held a news conference before the game to honor jeter and present him with some gifts jeff wilpon , the mets' chief operating officer and the son of fred wilpon , the team s principal owner , presented jeter with a ceramic mosaic made of subway tiles with his no 2 in the middle to honor his success in the subway series since 1997 , jeter had a 364 batting average against the mets , and 13 home runs , 19 doubles and 67 runs wilpon also gave jeter an oversize check for 22 , 22222 for his charity , the turn 2 foundation there s a lot of twos in it , wilpon said two hundred and twentytwo dollars \? jeter asked politely either genuinely uncertain about the figure or making a playful joke out of it this drew laughter from the gathered reporters and mets employees the question could have been perceived as a reference to the wilpons' financial difficulties , but it was almost surely not meant that way i just want to say thanks to the wilpon family , jeter said it s very much appreciated it s unnecessary i was just joking about the check everyone knows how much my foundation means to me , and i ca n't thank you enough jeter s comment reflected a theme he has touched on since the yankees' first series of the season in houston he said that nothing he got was expected or demanded , but everything is appreciated the only onfield ceremony thursday was a video tribute to jeter while he was playing catch before the game , a familiar reel of his career highlights that has been shown in similar form in all the cities he has visited for the last time when it was over , a cameraman focused his lens closely on jeter as he played catch jeter doffed his cap to the crowd as the fans politely cheered , and then continued to throw there was a game to prepare for
boston there is so much history between the teams that to term it a rivalry would be an injustice but history has mostly sided with the , which may have made the ' fans uneasy even this year , when their team was the better regularseason squad by far the bruins , who also appeared to have an advantage at goalie , were determined to avenge last year s loss to chicago in the stanley cup finals and for a while looked as if they might none of that mattered to the canadiens , though , who confirmed the fears of the boston fans by playing spoiler again sizable underdogs at the start of their eastern conference semifinal series , and underdogs still as it went to a game 7 , the canadiens channeled their inner ken drydens and guy lafleurs to earn a stunning , 31 victory over the bruins at td garden on wednesday goalie carey price \( 29 saves \) and forward daniel briere \( a goal and an assist \) led the way as montreal advanced to the conference finals against the rangers game 1 is saturday in montreal we were really motivated to win this series , said montreal s michel therrien , who coached his 53rd playoff game and his first game 7 we just beat the best team in the league this was the sixth time in nine game 7s between them that the canadiens had sent the bruins home the bruins have accounted for 39 percent of all the game 7s in the canadiens' history , dating to 1952 , when maurice richard sustained a concussion but returned to score the winning goal in the semifinals most of the results have been as cathartic for the canadiens as they have been demoralizing for the bruins while wednesday s game might not match the shock of the drydenled upset in 1971 , which was en route to a montreal stanley cup , or the heartbreak of the toomanymenontheice loss in 1979 , which also led to a montreal title , it nonetheless goes down as yet another monumental disappointment for the bruins boston largely considered this a stanleycuporbust season , and it ended early and unexpectedly the bruins had 17 more points and eight more victories than montreal in the regular season they led this series by 32 and then managed a single goal in the final two games it s very tough it s very disappointing , bruins wing brad marchand said i think we expected to go all the way this year it s hard to really put into words we expected a lot more zdeno chara , boston s captain , who struggled most of the game , said i would lie to you if i say it s not disappointing , especially after the season we had our goals were much higher than finishing in the second round chara , a defenseman , epitomized the bruins' uneven , sloppy play he had two penalties and no shots on goal in nearly 23 minutes of ice time he had one of the team s 16 turnovers and it was his left skate that inadvertently redirected a briere pass past tuukka rask with 2 minutes 53 seconds left in the game , effectively ending the game chara had plenty of company david krejci and marchand did not score in the series marchand , who has not scored in his last 20 playoff games , had a pointblank opportunity on price late in the first period and shot the puck over the net the canadiens struck early , with briere setting up dale weise , who had slipped behind the boston defense , for a redirection goal 2 18 into the game the quick score stunned the bruins they had seven turnovers in the first period alone and often looked lifeless that first goal definitely sucked the energy out of us , and it was hard to get it back , center patrice bergeron said montreal made it 20 midway through the second period when max pacioretty finished off a 2on1 with david desharnais the bruins cut their deficit to 21 late in the period with a powerplay goal on a redirection by jarome iginla \( he also hit the post in the third period on a rebound attempt \) iginla s goal snapped a shutout streak of 103 46 for price , who had not allowed a goal since the third period of game 5 price , who backstopped canada to the gold medal in the sochi olympics , joins the list of montreal goalies dryden , rogie vachon , gump worsley who have ended a bruins season and , with it , their hopes for a stanley cup montreal may soon play for its 25th stanley cup and first in 21 years boston will have to wait another year in hopes of getting its seventh
san diego for someone who feels as much at home here as a torrey pine , enters this week s feeling strangely out of sorts because of the pga tour s switch to a wraparound schedule that began in october instead of january , woods , the world s topranked player and the reigning player of the year , will make his season debut thursday from a potbunkersize hole in the playoff race while woods was on the world cup ski circuit , and then the hospital circuit , in support of his girlfriend , , jimmy walker amassed a tourleading 1 , 233 points in six events woods , 38 , is old enough to remember when top players did not begin their seasons until march everybody took breaks , never played the west coast swing at all and showed up , and those guys won the money title , player of the year , and did it that way , he said those days are long gone , and woods has nobody to blame but himself en route to winning 79 tour titles , including seven at this tournament , woods attracted more athletic youngsters and corporate dollars to the game , turning a niche sport into a global money grab it was fitting that woods accepted his 2013 player of the year trophy on the eve of his first start of the new season in men s professional golf , the calendar has become one highlight loop this year s schedule is an ultramarathon that all the tour members are running for the first time , but for woods it has been especially hard to develop a plan of attack his intention was to leave the tour during the olympics to travel to russia to watch vonn try to defend her women s downhill title asked in early december whether he would make the trip to sochi , woods replied i think that s just day to day we just do n't know how her leg s going to be we 'll just take it day to day , race to race woods s plans for february were scotched when vonn , the first american to win a women s olympic downhill , came to terms with the severity of her leg injury and pulled out of the sochi games she had a second operation on her reconstructed right knee after reinjuring it during a race late last month in france , with woods watching from the bottom of the hill usually , woods knows his schedule from one month to the next on wednesday , he spoke about his schedule the way he did the fedex cup points race as if he did not have a handle on it he will head to dubai next week for a european tour event , but will woods s next start be the tour stop in los angeles , the matchplay event in tucson , the tour event near his south florida home or none of the above \? that s a very good question , he said without elaborating woods knows better than most what it must have been like for vonn to try to win on one good leg at the 2008 at torrey pines south , the same course that will be used this week , woods , though clearly in pain from a surgically reconstructed knee and a broken leg , beat rocco mediate in a playoff for his 14th major title the victory moved him within four of the career leader , jack nicklaus as far as seeing what she s gone through , i 've been through it , only a slightly different version , woods said i 've never had to do it twice like this , and to do a total reconstruction of the acl he added , that s tough woods was sidelined for the last two majors of 2008 , but there was always next year vonn will have to wait four more for her next shot at olympic glory to be the first one to ever win in the downhill , that s something no one can ever take away , whether she competes this year or whether she competes four years from now , woods said whatever happens the next four days , woods s playing record here is unassailable only 10 other players in this week s 156man field have as many career tour titles as woods has wins in this tournament i 've played at a high level for a very long time , but it s not easy to do , woods said tell that to the elder of his two children , daughter sam , 6 , who last year took a shine to the torrey pineshaped trophy that is awarded to the tournament champion because it reminded her of the bonsai tree that is featured in the karate kid movies she said , you need to get one of those , ' woods said he explained to her that it was not that easy , that daddy had to go out and earn it she said , ok , go do it , ' he said after securing a fourstroke victory over brandt snedeker and josh teater in a weatherdelayed monday finish , woods brought the torrey pine trophy home to florida they put it literally in the middle of the room , woods said everybody was dancing around the trophy
learned from his most publicized mistake ascertained next to nothing from james s and his own that has been one fundamental difference this season in the operational atmospheres of james s and anthony s  the biggest challenge is trying to win a championship , and everything else is semantics , miami s shane battier said before , 10292 , on thursday at madison square garden there has been a lot of talk about what people are going to do , a lot of hyperbole , and we all realize that has no bearing on us trying to a championship for emphasis , he added , zero , none that s primarily because james , who was seated a few feet from battier , wearing headphones and a hoodie , took the opposite approach from that of anthony , who in october said he would opt out of his deal next summer to explore free agency from day 1 of training camp , james declared the subject of his potential free agency off limits having experienced the subversive effects of contractual contretemps while and after he connived to join the knicks from denver , , anthony might have thought twice about injecting the cloud of uncertainty into another season it laid a foundation of egg shells for all to walk on it put everyone on notice , and on edge it set an organizational mantra do n't mess with melo could coach mike woodson really tell his star forward what he thought when anthony went his own way with the ball \? how could a younger knick with less leverage iman shumpert , for one not have been affected by the implied policy of pandering \? this is not to put the brunt of the earlyseason struggles the knicks are finally digging out of witness their victories over san antonio and miami on anthony but his declaration of planned contractual independence did not help his team coalesce around him the lesson james learned was , as battier said , speculation about the future , what could happen and all the hypotheticals , does n't add to our cause we want to make the most of what s in front of us right now as opposed to what transpired for james way back when it was soon after thanksgiving in 2008 , from behind a microphone before a cavaliersknicks game at the garden , that he forewarned his followers , july 1 , 2010 , is going to be a very , very big day actually , it was a week after that date that james officially put the capital d in his decision to sign with miami but the long advance notice stirred the masses and the news media , destabilizing james s environment in cleveland and contributing to his exit from his native northern ohio this year , coming off consecutive championship seasons , understanding that each opportunity in the prime years of his career is precious , james was n't about to make that mistake again what did he have to gain but the attention a more malleable james was seduced by the last time around \? james approached the season with a firm resolve not to talk about what comes next why worry about next season without knowing how this one will play out \? case in point not long ago , speculation was that one relocation possibility for james could be los angeles , with the lakers but if he were to leave miami , it would presumably be after he determined that dwyane wade s career was in irreversible decline now that the lakers have given kobe bryant a twoyear contract extension , what sense would it make for james to leave one fading superstar in miami for another in los angeles \? would james return to cleveland \? consider teaming with joakim noah and the recovering derrick rose in chicago \? present pat riley , the heat s president , with a trade demand , with the alternative being losing him for nothing \? these are all interesting but unanswerable questions as james has concluded and battier articulated , future scenarios are way beyond what james can control right now the pursuit of a third championship ring this is what we 're here for , james said the x factor is the condition of wade s knees miami hopes that , with rest and regeneration after the shockwave treatment he received over the summer , he will be fully functional by the playoffs but maybe he will never be the nightly force he once was it s impossible to know , pointless to guess james does n't bother my responsibility changes a little bit , he said , not arguing with the insinuation that wade s absences in 8 of 36 games take james back to his cleveland days , in charge of all heavy lifting wade has averaged 196 points , 49 rebounds and 48 assists in the games he has played he made a few acrobatic shots thursday night , scoring 23 points , but strangely missed all six of his freethrow attempts caution is probably miami s main motive in sitting wade , but when heat coach erik spoelstra said that every game presented a gametime decision , that did n't sound promising we evaluate we communicate , he said we have a veteran team that s had to sacrifice a lot , but we understand the big picture it s all about the moment thursday night provided anthony s best moments of the season he had a jameslike game 29 points , 8 rebounds , 5 assists and scrappy defense the balanced knicks looked like a serious team again the best 1322 team in history without the ill tyson chandler and the benched j r smith asked about anthony , james said i know he wants to win i know he can win as for the bigpicture prescription , looming free agency , james added , whatever makes him happy that , of course , is the ultimate question , the pursuit of an immeasurable ingredient or quality that separates the very good from the greats who can happily lock in to the here and now \? phrased another way , how many titles have been won when next season was allowed to infect this one \? a good guess would be zero , none
justice ruth bader ginsburg , in a from a 2007 supreme court decision that made it harder for women to sue employers for pay discrimination , suggested that the court s majority was not in tune with the realities of the workplace her background as general counsel to the american civil liberties union , where she had in 1972 , surely informed her thinking unfortunately , that kind of experience is both less common and more controversial on the federal bench today if she were being considered for a seat on the court these days , justice ginsburg , my aclu connection would probably disqualify me but even though some senators think it s politically incorrect to say so , a judge s experience and personal history are , at times , critical to how she or he approaches the job given this reality , the makeup of the judiciary should reflect as much as possible the public whose cases come before it for a long time , most of the attention to increasing diversity has focused on race , ethnicity and gender , where progress has been slow but incremental equally important is diversity of professional experience , which gets less attention regrettably , under the obama administration , federal judges continue to be drawn overwhelmingly from the ranks of prosecutors and corporate lawyers this deprives the courts of crucial perspectives and reduces public trust in the justice system according to , about 85 percent of mr obama s nominees to the federal bench have been corporate attorneys or prosecutors , or both , in some cases fewer than 4 percent have worked as lawyers in publicinterest organizations and while 43 percent of his nominees to the federal trial courts were previously state or federal prosecutors , only 15 percent were public defenders at the appellate level , only 4 out of 56 nominees were public defenders and 21 were prosecutors professional diversity on the federal bench was once more valued in a 1992 tribute to justice thurgood marshall , justice byron white spoke of the benefit of working with a jurist who , in addition to being the first black justice , had also been a renowned civilrights lawyer thurgood brought to the conference table years of experience in an area that was of vital importance to our work , experience that none of us could claim to match , thurgood could tell us the way it was recently , mr obama has worked to strike a better balance in january , he submitted four district court nominees with underrepresented backgrounds , including a former public defender and a solo practitioner in criminal defense republicans who are more businessfriendly and like to appear tough on crime will continue to fight such nominees but , for now at least , their resistance has been thwarted by the elimination of the senate filibuster for lowerlevel federal judges that is how mr obama succeeded in getting cornelia pillard a law professor and former lawyer for the naacp legal defense and educational fund , the secondmost powerful court after the supreme court there are currently more than 50 federal judicial vacancies without a nominee with control of the senate looming in the midterm elections , mr obama should act quickly to nominate a more professionally diverse cast of judges while he can
jerusalem on feb 4 , 1965 , as a teenager , i left south africa , the country of my birth , for a new home in a place i 'd never been israel i loved south africa , but i loathed the apartheid system in israel , i saw a fresh start for a people rising from the ashes of the holocaust , a place of light and justice , as opposed to the darkness and oppression of apartheid south africa now , almost 50 years later , after decades of arguing that israel is not an apartheid state and that it s a calumny and a lie to say so , i sense that we may be well down the road to being seen as one that s because , in this day and age , brands are more powerful than truth and , inexplicably , blindly , israel is letting itself be branded an apartheid state and even encouraging it in apartheid south africa , people disappeared in the night without the protection of any legal process and were never heard from again there was no freedom of speech or expression and more judicial hangings were reportedly carried out there than in any other place on earth there was no free press and , until january 1976 , no public television masses of black people were forcibly moved from tribal lands to arid bantustans in the middle of nowhere a pass system stipulated where blacks could live and work , splitting families and breaking down social structures , to provide cheap labor for the mines and whiteowned businesses , and a plentiful pool of domestic servants for the white minority those found in violation were arrested , usually lashed , and sentenced to stints of hard labor for a few shillings per prisoner per day , payable to the prison service none of this even remotely exists in israel or the occupied territories but , increasingly , in the mind of the world it does this is because of israel s own actions and a vigorous campaign by those who oppose its occupation of palestinians' land and , in some cases , israel s right to exist as a jewish state they understand that delegitimization is israel s soft belly and apartheid the buzzword to make it happen international isolation is potentially more dangerous for israel than the iranian nuclear program the palestinians and their supporters , particularly the young generation , some of whom have graduated from the best universities in the world , have come to realize that the stones of the first intifada and the suicide bombers of the second are yesterday s weapons in yesterday s war boycott , divestment and sanctions are now the way they seek to end the israeli occupation or jewish israel itself their message has started to resonate with trade unions , churches , universities and international companies in europe and the united states , who see israel as oppressing palestinians and violating their human rights a dutch pension giant s decision last month to divest from israel s five largest banks because of their ties to occupation rang warning bells in israel s business community and the treasury according to the finance minister , even a partial european boycott would cost israel 20 billion shekels \( about 57 billion \) in exports annually and almost 10 , 000 jobs but the greatest damage is selfinflicted the apartheid wall , apartheid roads , colonization , administrative arrests , travel restrictions , land confiscations and house demolitions are the clay apartheid comparisons are made of , and cannot be hidden or denied , for as long as israel continues with the status quo military occupation comes with checkpoints , antiterrorist barriers , military courts , armed soldiers and tanks that s the reality , no matter what your politics , and just the ammunition the palestinians and their supporters need in their new war in the coming weeks , the united states is expected to put forward a framework for peace between israel and the palestinians , brokered by secretary of state john kerry the palestinians have said that if the talks fail to produce an agreement , they will take the battle against israel and for their independence to the international criminal court and the united nations and its various organizations , and fight for sanctions and boycotts , which they hope will force israel , like apartheid south africa before it , to its knees as south africa learned in the 1980s , possessing nuclear weapons may deter foes on the battlefield , but it does n't help you win a propaganda war unfortunately , israel is doing almost everything it can to help its opponents achieve their goal instead of focusing on peace talks , israel continuously signals its intention to build more settlement housing , most recently on jan 10 , when plans for 1 , 400 new homes in east jerusalem and the west bank were announced instead of welcoming eritrean and sudanese refugees seeking asylum the way that a former likud party prime minister , menachem begin , did in 1977 with the vietnamese boat people , saying they reminded him of jewish refugees during the holocaust israel is confining today s asylumseekers to a camp in the desert , providing reams of footage to those who want to prove israel is a racist society and it did n't help when , on dec 15 , a ministerial committee approved a bill that would impose heavy , punitive taxes on groups like b'tselem , which tracks alleged human rights violations in the occupied territories , and adalah , the legal center for minority rights in israel as anyone who has bought a gucci bag in a bangkok market can tell you , it s all in the label and the apartheid label is beginning to stick fair or not it carries with it huge consequences for israel , which the country s inwardlooking leaders seem impervious to they have yet to understand that on this new battlefield , tanks do n't count and the use of force , sure to be televised , plays into the hands of the enemy it s a war israel cannot win unless it makes peace

if wichita state s players have been a bit dismissive of their 340 record , it is not because they have not accomplished much an undefeated regular season for a men s college basketball team is nothing to sniff at but the shockers also know the record will fall into the dustbin of history if they do not follow up with an ncaa title , a midmajor team that could not shake the mid but if the shockers win the ncaa championship , they will join rarefied air occupied by the likes of bill russell , john wooden , lew alcindor , bill walton , frank mcguire and indiana s most hoosierlike set of hoosiers only seven division i men s basketball teams have finished a season undefeated and capped by an ncaa title , none since those super hoosiers of 1976 in fact , since then , only two other men s teams have managed an undefeated regular and conference tournament season larry bird s 1979 indiana state team was 330 when it ran headlong into magic johnson s michigan state team in the ncaa finals and lost in 1991 , unlv looked like a shooin to demolish all comers on its way to a second consecutive ncaa title but a pesky duke team ended all that for the 340 runnin' rebels in a shocking 7977 win in the national semifinals the college landscape has changed since the superteam era of the 1960s and 1970s , making undefeated seasons so much harder to attain the popularity of the sport has increased , attracting players with starryeyed visions of hitting that last shot to win the championship more teams have more talented players , and early entry to the nba has cost the powerhouses their best players before they can build dynasties the ncaa tournament itself has changed and expanded and made it more difficult to win the field has gradually expanded from eight teams \( from 1939 to 1950 \) to 68 to win the 25team ncaa tournament in 1956 , san francisco needed to win four games when ucla had its four undefeated seasons and indiana claimed the last , it took five victories in 1985 the tournament jumped to 64 teams from 53 , and no one has been undefeated since can wichita state end that streak \?
kawhmu , myanmar the pastelpainted vocational school hacked out of the bamboo jungle is a long way from the international salons where s symbol of resistance , , is now an established figure here in her parliamentary district , a network of poor ricegrowing hamlets , the opposition leader and nobel peace laureate played local politician opening a hotel training school that she hopes will catapult talented students out of the fields and into jobs as maids , cooks and butlers in myanmar s booming tourist industry our society wants to have academia , she said to a small crowd in oxfordinflected english , a remnant of her university days in britain but we have to be practical it s a matter of equipping our children with skills that see them through life few doubt that ms aung san suu kyi has done well for her constituents , delivering electricity where none existed , using her cachet to draw hoteliers from thailand and switzerland to invest in the school but on the eve of a visit by president obama to myanmar , where he is expected to meet with her on friday , human rights advocates and even members of her political party are raising questions about her performance in the broader political arena in the four years since she emerged from house arrest as a worldfamous champion of democracy , ms aung san suu kyi , 69 , has hesitated to take on many of her country s biggest issues , critics say , and has failed those who expected a staunch human rights advocate she has instead emphasized a general call for rule of law , a critical issue for a country emerging from a halfcentury of dictatorship but one , they say , that falls short of addressing particular grievances since entering parliament two years ago , she has been by government forces against civilians in the ethnic conflict in kachin state , saying both sides were responsible for killings as chairwoman of a panel investigating land disputes between poor farmers and a copper mining company accused of unfairly taking their land , perhaps most surprising of all , she has refused to admonish the government for its , policies that mr obama criticized last week those policies , along with episodes of deadly violence against the rohingya by radical buddhists , have driven hundreds of thousands of rohingya from their homes and confined more than 100 , 000 to squalid camps in public comments , ms aung san suu kyi has equated the plight of the rohingya with that of the region s buddhists , saying that it was important not to forget violence is committed by both sides human rights advocates , who argue that most of the violence has been committed by the buddhist majority against the rohingya minority , say they are astonished that she has abdicated what they see as her moral responsibility to shine a light on obvious human rights abuses she has remained immune to appeals from american officials , who say they have suggested on a number of occasions that she speak out on the rohingya it s not the political authority of her office people are asking her to wield , said john sifton , asia advocacy director for human rights watch it is her moral authority it is her authority as an iconic nobel peace prize winner that she has failed to wield as the opposition leader in a parliament dominated by the military and former members of the military , which ruled the country for nearly five decades , her ability to steer government policy is limited but she has raised her voice on some issues , particularly in opposition to the military s power to veto constitutional amendments , a brave stance that wins her plaudits but that so far has not succeeded her pet project is the parliamentary rule of law and tranquillity committee , an advisory panel on one of the country s central problems , and the police next month , two centers to train police officers and judges , sponsored at her panel s urging by the united nations development program , will begin operations , an aide said her defenders say she is doing great work under extraordinarily difficult circumstances she has tried to change the country , but she ca n't because it is a government still dominated by the military , said myint myint khin pe , the founder of the free funeral service society , a charity that organizes lowcost funerals for the poor she s very intelligent but alone in response to criticism that she could do more to quicken the pace of reform , she has blamed the ruling party for dragging its feet but people who have come to know her in the last four years say they are mystified as to why she has remained so muted , even in her freedom some see her positions , and her silences , as political expedience she should speak out about the rohingya to prevent us burmese from being racist , said ko tar , an environmental and education advocate it is a political calculation that she does not in many respects , he said , she tends to side with the elite on the copper mine she made a strategic calculation not to anger the company , he said she could not feel the suffering of the people when environmental activists campaigned against a chinesebuilt dam , she made anodyne statements about the irrawaddy river being an essential waterway but declined to get involved , he said , and she has refused to be drawn into the effort to decentralize the rigid education system she is silent on education there is no discussion in the parliament on education , he said women s groups concerned about a recent bill to ban interfaith marriages asked for her help , said daw zin mar aung , a member of ms aung san suu kyi s political party we were threatened by the ultranationalists and the monks over our stand against the law , she said she told us to inform the police , but the police are useless ms aung san suu kyi depends for much of her advice on a small kitchen cabinet dominated by two women she has known through long friendships , a western diplomat said one of them is daw ohmar moe myint , whose husband , a powerful businessman , was on the united states sanctions list until 2012 the other is her chief of staff , dr tin mary aung , a medical doctor and a rakhine , the ethnic group fighting the rohingya in western myanmar some diplomats say dr tin mary aung may influence ms aung san suu kyi s decision to keep a low profile on the rohingyas ms aung san suu kyi has granted few interviews with foreign media recently , and people who work with her said it would not be possible to interview her for this article but when she has responded to criticism , she has not backed down from controversial positions i have never done anything just for popularity , she said after being heckled by angry farmers over the copper mine last year sometimes politicians have to do things that people dislike questions about where she stands are all the more urgent given that she could wield considerable power after elections next year , which her party , the national league for democracy , is expected to win she remains a national hero , and even disillusioned supporters say they would like her to be president but the country s 2008 constitution bars candidates with a foreignborn spouse or foreignborn children from seeking the top office , a prohibition that seems to have been written with her in mind her late husband , michael aris , was british her two adult sons were born in britain diplomats say she may have settled in her own mind for the post of speaker of the house , also a powerful position at the end of the schoolopening ceremony , journalists crowded around they wanted to know about the ruling party s opposition to changing the constitution , and about the assassination days earlier of a journalist , ko par gyi , who worked for her as a bodyguard in the late 1980s this is not the time , she said , waving them off as she slid her slight frame into a white fourwheeldrive vehicle and drove away toward her home in yangon
istanbul has issued new regulations that grant secure legal status in the country for the first time , clarifying and expanding rights for more than a million people who are rapidly assimilating into turkish society after spending nearly four years under temporary protection , in recent weeks the refugees have begun to receive new identification cards under a measure passed by the council of ministers in october granting them access to basic services like health care and education the regulation stops short of granting syrians official refugee status , which would entitle them to a broader array of benefits like housing , public relief and various social services nevertheless , most refugees have welcomed it as an indication of s commitment to easing the rigors of their lives as their displacement takes on a sense of permanence , with civil war raging on with no end in sight is now host to 16 million displaced syrians , about half of the total number of people who have fled fighting that broke out nearly four years ago until now , the refugees had been labeled guests under a hazily defined temporary protection measure with turkey s 22 operating at capacity , around 85 percent of the syrian refugees there have streamed into urban areas seeking jobs and more permanent living arrangements the new id cards have been designed to give more straightforward access to a wider range of services outside of the camps on a recent afternoon at a police station here , dozens of syrian refugees amassed outside the registration bureau for foreigners , waiting to collect their new cards syrians used to avoid coming to the station out of fear that they would be deported , said one of the police officers overseeing the registration process but these cards have brought them out of the shadows into the light they now have physical proof of their legal rights the international response to the refugee disaster has been relatively limited , forcing the neighboring countries to take on a disproportionate amount of the burden , with turkey , jordan , lebanon and iraq absorbing 97 percent of s refugees , according to the united nations' refugee agency for turkey , the ceaseless influx of refugees has greatly strained its opendoor policy , while the recent drop in commodities prices worldwide has put new strains on the national budget andrew gardner , turkey researcher for amnesty international , praised the country s new temporary protection regime as a big step forward , as it grants refugees a secure legal status the fact that the refugees' rights and entitlements have been written into law should mean that authorities better implement them , he added but not all syrians are lining up to obtain these rights many have their sights set on seeking asylum in western europe , a prospect that some believe could be jeopardized by the new id cards through their requirement of biometric data i think the data could be used by europe to send us back when we get smuggled there , said mohammad , 23 , who declined to give his surname i'm only in turkey to leave to europe , i do n't need the id when i see the police gathering syrians in the park for registration , i run away even refugees who have already received the new id cards can be skeptical that the new provisions will have much of an impact on their quality of life , and continue to look for a way out of turkey marwan ali , 35 , a tailor , said his main incentive for registering was to receive for his daughter and regular access to health care for his pregnant wife without the id cards , the hospitals send you away , he explained but mr ali quickly added that he had submitted an application for asylum in europe life is hard here , he said you make less than 200 a month it s hard to survive with a family a vast majority of refugees who settle in large cities are destitute the greatest challenge for syrians living outside the camps is finding and sustaining employment under turkish labor laws , syrian refugees do not have the right to work , which makes them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse a separate proposal to regulate working conditions for the refugees was recently submitted to the council of ministers for approval if the measure passes , as expected , syrians will be able to apply for conditional work permits with their new id cards , something that is likely to foster resentment in regions where unemployment is high that job competition , as well as the emergence of violence and higher crime rates in cities with high concentrations of syrians , has soured the turkish public on the refugees , with twothirds of turks now favoring more restrictive policies , according to the 2014 transatlantic trends survey this month , a group of syrian agricultural workers in the southern province of antalya were attacked by a group of local workers , who stoned them and their houses , injuring several the day before , the governor had sent a notification demanding the deportation of up to 1 , 500 syrian refugees , citing growing concerns over unrest , which he claimed had caused damage to the tourism ministry , local news media reported nurcan onder , the deputy director general for labor , said the work permits would not put refugees in direct competition with turkish citizens for jobs , and should alleviate some tensions the regulation will clearly define specific sectors and locations where syrians can apply for work permits , and quotas will be applied in workplaces to manage the supply and demand , ms onder said some refugee advocates say that the new directive is too focused on the regulatory aspects of the refugee influx , such as entry and registration , and that it has failed to address the needs of refugees that are essential to meeting longerterm integration goals most syrian refugees live in urban areas , and the conditions are deteriorating as winter sets in , but none of their real needs , like housing , are met properly , said metin corabatir , deputy director of the center for immigration and asylum studies they are considered as people under a temporary protection regime , but the regime does not provide enough assistance and protection for those outside of the camps , he added the directive has also come under criticism for its failure to define the time frame for the temporary protection in theory it could be repealed at any time
beirut , lebanon deadly battles are raging in homs , the central syrian city that was long a hub and a symbol of the revolt against president , with both soldiers and insurgents saying they have lost many fighters in recent days as the government presses an allout assault on the last few rebelheld areas in the old city of homs insurgents and antigovernment activists reported nearcontinuous bombardment of the old city enclaves and the nearby neighborhood of waer , a sometimes restive area whose population of 100 , 000 has been doubled by displaced syrians , including many from the old city , sheltering there state news media and government opponents reported that a car bomb killed numerous people on friday outside a mosque in an area called march 8 square near a government checkpoint each side blamed the other , giving death tolls ranging from none to more than 30 university students and refugees living in the area were reported to be among the dead in the latest of many such bombings an army officer reached on the old city s outskirts said soldiers were advancing and taking casualties , but while officers had earlier predicted a quick victory , he declined to say when the fight would end government opponents and their international backers called on the united nations to take action to prevent what they feared would be an imminent massacre in the old city , saying that despite evacuations of about 1 , 500 civilians from the areas , more than 100 remained , along with more than 1 , 000 fighters but with the security council divided , as russia backs the government and the united states backs the opposition , only a tepid statement of grave concern was issued on thursday the deadlock comes despite a calling for full access to humanitarian aid , and admonitions in recent days from the syrian opposition coalition and the united nations mediator for , lakhdar brahimi the coalition said the council risked becoming a mere spectator , and mr brahimi said homs had again become a theater of death and destruction , three months after the evacuation deal raised hopes for calm jen psaki , a state department spokeswoman , said the syrian government was not only ignoring the security council resolution but also intentionally increasing the despair of the syrian people in its allout bid to retain personal power the syrian government says it is rooting out foreign fighters and terrorists who have shelled civilian areas homs has long been a focal point of international demands that fighters lift blockades of food and supplies for civilians , a practice used by both sides but in more cases by the government in the old city , besieged and bombarded by the government for much of the past two years ,  a committee of homs residents , which helped negotiate the evacuations , recently issued a statement declaring that while the eyes of the world had turned away from homs , civilians were still starving in the old city and facing indiscriminate bombardment and blockades there and in waer but government officials say those who remain in the old city are entirely insurgents , and soldiers and security officials on its outskirts told reporters on a recent visit that the stage was set for a battle to crush all those who remained the homs governor , talal barazi , said there was no more need to deliver aid to the area , because the government does n't desire to provide the armed groups with aid abu bilal , an insurgent spokesman whose name is a nom de guerre , said friday that the old city was covered in smoke and that shrapnel was flying continuously as the government used mortars and heavy artillery , and barrel bombs dropped by helicopters more than seven hours of continuous bombing it s an insane war , he said with all this mess , a fighter arrived at the makeshift hospital his body was covered with shrapnel wounds , but he was smiling he said , i had shish tawook' grilled chicken on skewers , a dream meal for fighters and civilians in the old city , long deprived of meat the fighter , abu bilal said , had been with a group that stormed a government post and found rice , soda , yogurt and the chicken the government s offer of reconciliation , amnesty and evacuation for those who lay down arms has sown division among those remaining , with some residents speculating that a was murdered by fighters opposing the evacuations , and others contending that government infiltrators killed him to pave the way for the assault some fighters argue that they should accept the evacuation deal because staying put is suicidal united nations officials have said that under international law , people in wartime have the right to receive food where they are without having to leave their homes or make deals abu bilal said there would be no more reconciliations , no more negotiations , and condemned those who evacuated as hypocrites who revealed our vulnerabilities and positions in waer , yamen abu omar , a resident and opposition spokesman , described constant artillery fire and shortages of food and medicine for 200 , 000 people yesterday was one of the most difficult days waer has lived , he said there is no support , and the siege is crippling , but we are steady residents were also fleeing the last few homs suburbs still in insurgent hands , fearing government assaults , said samer , an antigovernment activist who said he had survived a , about 20 miles northwest of homs , in 2012 i do n't want to witness another , he said i prefer to die from a shell
washington as the rate of new infections in has slowed , american and liberian officials are debating whether to build all 17 planned ebola treatment centers in the country or to shift money from the obama administration that was planned for the centers into other programs to combat future outbreaks the united states announced monday that it had completed the first of the 100bed centers , some 40 miles outside monrovia , in tubmanburg , and turned over its operation to the international organization for migration , which will staff and run the center two other treatment units , in sinje , to the north of monrovia , and buchanan , to the south , will be completed by the end of november , american military officials said seven additional treatment units across the country are in various stages of construction a 25bed hospital recently opened outside monrovia , and american and liberian military officials are clearing the land for two more units if all of them go ahead as planned , that would bring the total units built by the american and liberian militaries working together on the project to 13 , or four short of the units promised by president obama on sept 16 but mr obama s promise came at the height of the epidemic , when new cases were increasing at a brisk rate since then , the rate of new infections in liberia has come down and several treatment units around the country have for more than a month reported empty beds the world health organization said wednesday that there had been a stabilization in the decline of new infections in liberia , which reported 97 new cases last week everyone involved , from the who to the liberian government to the obama administration , has warned against complacency in international efforts to fight the disease but both american and liberian officials say that if the numbers continue to decline , it may be wiser to shift the funds toward other needs in the country they would be fools to spend all that money on etus , said stephen d cashin , chief executive of the pan african capital group and an adviser to president ellen johnson sirleaf of liberia , speaking of the ebola treatment units they 're better to spend the money on putting in place the expertise and skill sets and county medical clinics and health care to provide care to the masses of people of liberia , and to create a system of movable clinics and testing centers and hot spots capt robert c langston , a public affairs officer with the united states army in monrovia , said the liberian government was taking the lead on deciding where and when the units would be built but he said the american military , which has 2 , 100 troops in liberia , will remain agile and flexible to respond quickly to needs on the ground as they change american military officials say they now think that fewer american troops will deploy to west africa to build units and train health workers than originally planned perhaps 3 , 000 instead of 4 , 000 brig gen daniel d ziankahn , chief of staff of the armed forces of liberia , said in a telephone interview that a decision would be made soon on whether to go ahead with all of the planned treatment units there s going to be some decision point as to whether we have to shift our efforts to something else , he said mr obama has asked congress for 6 billion to fight ebola in the united states and west africa , a request that administration officials defended before the senate appropriations committee on wednesday we believe we have the right strategy in place both at home and abroad , sylvia mathews burwell , the secretary of the department of health and human services , said at the hearing additional funding is needed , and that s what we 're here to talk about today if the full congress approves the funding , it would be the single largest sum to combat ebola from any country or international organization the request seemed to gain bipartisan support the hearing had none of the contentiousness of one in the house last month in which officials were grilled for hours about the initial flawed federal response to ebola cases in the united states senator barbara a mikulski , democrat of maryland and chairwoman of the committee , said she hoped the request would be granted , adding that it was similar to when president george w bush asked for emergency funding to fight in 2009 we 've done this before , she said under the request , the department of health and human services would receive about 3 billion , a third of which would be spent in the united states on items such as personal protective equipment and monitoring travelers at american airports in the hardest hit countries in africa , the money would go to bolstering infection control , including support for laboratories and to help develop a local health care work force trained in identifying outbreaks the state department and the united states agency for international development would together receive nearly 3 billion to go toward supplies , logistics networks , burial teams and education to prevent the spread of the disease about 15 billion of the total 6 billion the federal agencies are asking for would go to a socalled contingency fund to be spread among federal agencies to meet unexpected and sudden needs , such as a vaccination campaign for health workers , should a vaccine become available about 250 million would go to the national institutes of health and the food and drug administration to speed the development of vaccines and other therapies
last year , brianna danner , 17 , had never even held a rugby ball fourteen months later , she is weighing scholarship offers from two colleges with premier rugby teams it was a great lift to know the progress i 'd made meant i could go to college for something i love doing , said danner , a senior at the bronx studio school for writers and artists in recent years , the competition for basketball and football scholarships has grown more heated , with colleges recruiting athletes as young as 13 danner is one of a growing number of high school students who have discovered an alternative route to college through fringe sports like rugby , rowing and lacrosse more than 180 collegiate rugby clubs have started in the last four years , creating more financial aid opportunities roughly 100 women and 75 men across the country , including many minorities , received rugby scholarships last year karen fong donoghue , who runs a company that advises students being recruited to play college rugby , said she worked closely with about 30 players last year she added that she had presented seminars about rugby and college to about 2 , 000 families these scholarships have allowed students to leverage their rugby skills to get into these great colleges they might not otherwise , and interact with a population of kids they might not otherwise reach , fong donoghue said two other players on danner s high school team also received scholarship offers to play rugby the team meets four days a week , often at a public park near their school where they practice drop kicks and passes on a small patch of dirt , rocks and glass sandwiched between two baseball fields it has given them a prideful chip on their shoulder , said billy nicholas , danner s coach it is pretty rough , baseballs flying overhead , random loose dogs , strangers walking through practice but we make do and enjoy it all the students were introduced to the sport through play rugby usa , a youth development organization that helped start a girls' rugby team at their school in 2011 it is the only sport for girls at the school new york city has become a hotbed of rugby teams and rugby scholarships play rugby usa has added 40 rugby sites in the city in the last three years mark griffin , who founded play rugby usa in new york 10 years ago , said that he did not envision that his group would become a route to college we primarily care about giving these kids life skills , developing healthy habits and behaviors through rugby , he said college can certainly be part of that journey for many young people , it is the crucial part rosalind pena , 18 , first made her way onto the rugby field as a flanker during her sophomore year at the bronx studio school i saw this one tackle happen , and i instantly fell in love , she said but it was not until her senior year that she realized the sport could be her ticket to higher education two older siblings had gone to college , only to drop out after a semester pena s plans were fuzzy , but then she received a scholarship offer american international college , a fouryear private institution in springfield , mass , covered a large part of its 34 , 000 annual tuition so she could play on its women s rugby team , which is three years old pena , who is completing her freshman year , is majoring in psychology and criminal justice without the money , i probably would have had to go to a community college , she said i love new york , but i do n't want to go back , she added my goal in life is to travel a lot this marks the beginning of that goal of course , rugby is by no means a free pass to college only about a quarter of the country s 974 men s and women s collegiate rugby programs offer any sort of financial aid about 30 colleges have annual rugby budgets large enough more than 100 , 000 in some cases to offer substantial scholarships many other colleges award athletic merit scholarships , which are often paired with academic scholarships you ca n't be a minimum academic student and get a scholarship to rugby , fong donoghue said if you want to play for a really good program , you have to excel in school this is a sport that requires a smart player although the majority of rugby scholarships are not large enough to fully cover a college s tuition , the dent in the total cost can make a crucial difference for students from lowincome or even middleclass homes jefferson jimenez , 19 , spent many of his teenage years as a truant delinquent in inwood , a neighborhood in northern manhattan i used to think i would n't be able to go to college , he said three years ago , he was arrested on an assault charge the prospect of jail time was as terrifying as it was sobering changing his life became a necessity jimenez distanced himself from his friends and reenrolled in school he was placed at edward a reynolds west side high school , an alternative school in manhattan for overage , undercredited young adults the west side senior sports leadership academy , a partner of play rugby usa , is affiliated with jimenez s high school in october 2012 , he picked up a rugby ball for the first time and played in his first practice jimenez also joined old blue rfc , a professional men s team in manhattan rugby keeps me on the line , he said it demands responsibility from me it keeps me healthy it keeps me out of trouble jimenez is on track to graduate in june his athleticism is worthy of a scholarship , his coaches say , but his grades are not so jimenez plans take classes at brooklyn manhattan community college for a year to raise his grade point average and achieve his goal of earning a college rugby scholarship when jimenez encounters his old friends , the conversations are usually brief they have seen him around the neighborhood in his uniform , walking with teammates and sometimes carrying a strangelooking ball jimenez said that he did his best to persuade them to attend a practice friends of friends are welcome to participate but that none had i remember how hard it is to do , to come down here and leave that world behind , jimenez said for people like nicholas , the bronx studio school coach , who have witnessed rugby s many success stories and the lifechanging possibilities it has unlocked , there is no doubt the formula works there was no better feeling in the world than seeing my high school players in a college uniform , nicholas said except knowing rugby was part of getting them there
baton rouge , la a state district judge on friday threw out a challenge to senator mary l landrieu s bid for reelection in louisiana the judge , wilson fields , of baton rouge , ruled that a lawsuit questioning ms landrieu s residency was premature the suit , filed by state representative paul hollis , claimed that ms landrieu , a democrat , lived full time in washington and could not represent louisiana because she was not a state resident mr hollis , a republican , had briefly considered a run against ms landrieu judge fields said the united states constitution made it clear that the residency of senators mattered only on the day of an election she has not been elected , and if i read the constitution , in its plain language it says when elected , ' judge fields said the court will welcome a challenge only , he said , if and when ms landrieu is reelected on nov 4 ms landrieu , whose campaign is one of a handful that could determine control of the senate , is registered to vote at a home in new orleans that she owns with her parents , but she lists her capitol hill home as her address in regulatory documents mr hollis claimed that ms landrieu was a permanent resident of washington i have not decided if i should appeal , he said after the ruling friday morning ms landrieu had been subpoenaed to attend the hearing , but she did not appear we told our client that we 'd deal with this matter first , and if it goes to trial , she 'll be here , said tony clayton , ms landrieu s lead lawyer , when asked by the judge to explain her absence for ms landrieu s embattled reelection bid , the ruling may offer an opportunity to brush aside an issue that has become a flash point , despite having been carried over from her previous senate elections this has absolutely been settled , said kimberly l hood , another lawyer for ms landrieu this was an attempt to stage a political attack ad without paying the networks after today s ruling , we do not expect a challenge to the senator when elected but republicans still consider the residency issue , coupled with other recent controversies , to be part of a larger , viable political strategy the republican party , as well as conservative super pacs and other thirdparty groups , has run commercials criticizing ms landrieu for using her senate account to pay for chartered flights connected to her campaign , which she described as an accounting error that had been rectified while ms landrieu has begun a review of her expense filings , with the findings expected to be released soon , the louisiana republican party has filed a complaint with the senate ethics committee in concert with the questions raised about the chartered flights , opponents released online videos and directmail pieces this week that attacked ms landrieu over her legal residence the judge never ruled that she was a resident of new orleans it s still a ripe political issue , said jason dor , executive director of the louisiana republican party i think people have a hard time understanding why she can afford a 25 million home in washington but not a condo in new orleans fabien levy , ms landrieu s communications director , said in a statement that the republican interpretation of the ruling was flawed the judge was clear senator landrieu resides in louisiana and is qualified to run for the senate , as she has three times in the past , mr levy said ms landrieu is facing a wellfinanced challenge from representative bill cassidy , a republican also on the ballot is rob maness , a retired air force colonel who has the support of tea party groups here mr maness has asked louisiana s secretary of state and four district attorneys to investigate ms landrieu s residency claims , but none have committed to the inquiry because of questions over jurisdictional authority and statutory deadlines
freetown , sierra leone the gravedigger hacked at the cemetery s dense undergrowth , clearing space for the day s ebola victims a burial team , in protective suits torn with gaping holes , arrived with fresh bodies the backs of the battered secondhand vans carrying the dead were closed with twisted , rusting wire bodies were dumped in new graves , and a worker in a shortsleeve shirt carried away the stretcher , wearing only plastic bags over his hands as protection the outlook for the day at king tom cemetery was busy we will need much more space , said james c o hamilton , the chief gravedigger , as a colleague cleared the bush with his machete the ebola epidemic is spreading rapidly in sierra leone s densely packed capital and it may already be far worse than the authorities acknowledge since the beginning of the outbreak more than six months ago , the sierra leone health ministry reported only 10 confirmed ebola deaths here in freetown , the capital of more than one million people , and its suburbs as of sunday a hopeful sign that this city , unlike the capital of neighboring liberia , had been relatively spared the ravages of the outbreak but the bodies pouring in to the graveyard tell a different story in the last eight days alone , 110 ebola victims have been buried at king tom cemetery , according to the supervisor , abdul rahman parker , suggesting an outbreak that is much more deadly than either the government or international health officials have announced i'm working with the burial team , and the first question i ask them is , are they ebolapositive \? ' said mr parker , adding that the figures were based on medical certificates that he had seen himself the deaths are carefully recorded by name and date in a notebook headed ebola burials a burial team supervisor who drove up with fresh bodies echoed mr parker s assertion any body we collect is a positive case , said sorie kessebeh all the bodies that we are bringing in are positive beyond the many worrisome trends in the ebola epidemic seizing parts of west africa the overflowing hospitals , the presence of the disease in crowded cities , the deaths of scores of health workers trying to help another basic problem has stymied attempts to contain the disease no one seems to know how bad the outbreak really is the weeks ago that despite its efforts to tally the thousands of cases in the region , the official statistics probably vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak here in sierra leone , the government just finished an aggressive to get a handle on the epidemic , ordering the entire country to stay indoors for three days as an army of volunteers went door to door , explaining the dangers of the virus and trying to root out hidden pockets of illness still , the health ministry spokesman insisted that the epidemic was not as bad as the flow of bodies at the cemetery suggested it is not possible that all of them are ebolarelated deaths , said sidie yahya tunis , the health ministry spokesman , saying the corpses included people who died of other causes but as the cemetery records show , the challenge facing the government might be of a different magnitude than previously thought the majority of the recent deaths recorded at the cemetery were young people young adults , people in early middle age , or children with very few elderly people on the list several of the deaths also occurred in a concentrated area , sometimes in the same house , suggesting that a virulent infection had struck at the house of marion seisay the third name on the list her son acknowledged she was a secretary at wilberforce hospital , had died of ebola and was buried on sept 14 the house was now under quarantine , with some of its eight residents lingering on the cinderblock porch the way my mummy died was pathetic , said the son , michael foday , clearly frustrated by the quarantine how do you expect us to get food \? other houses in wilberforce barracks , the villagelike compound surrounding the hospital , were on the list of the dead and placed under quarantine , marked off from the surrounding jumble of shacks and cinderblock houses by a thin line of red or blue string in one of them , the house of momoh lomeh , the residents said that a total of five people who lived there had died of ebola yet four of them did not even appear on the cemetery list at another , the house of andrew mansoray , a family member said that the disease had been ruthless and unrelenting it would n't stop , abdul r kallon said of the diarrhea that mr mansoray , his brotherinlaw , had endured before dying they took him to the hospital , and they would n't let him out at another six households on the cemetery supervisor s list of the dead , residents gave similar accounts one family said the victim had definitely died of ebola , while five others described ebolalike symptoms vomiting , diarrhea , fever though none had been given an official cause of death international health experts here had no explanation for the striking discrepancy between the government s tally of the dead in the capital and the cemetery crew s statistics several of them noted the general confusion surrounding official statistics here from the beginning , with one leading international health official saying we do n't know exactly what is going on but nobody disputed that things appear to be getting worse the who has shown a sharp increase in new cases in freetown in recent weeks , rising from almost none early in the summer to more than 50 during the week of sept 14 various models of the growth of the epidemic here all show an exponential increase , said peter h kilmarx , the head of the centers for disease control and prevention team in sierra leone the conditions are amenable to ebola spread the goal of the government s national lockdown was to reach every household in the country , and officials claimed success in doing so on monday , saying that progress had been made in the fight against the disease but the exhaustion of the ebola gravediggers at king tom cemetery , who dig as many as 16 graves a day , indicated that the disease was far from being contained it s a herculean task , said mr hamilton , the chief gravedigger it s only out of patriotism that we are doing it the ebola victims were buried in an expanding stretch of fresh muddy graves under a giant cotton tree , and the makeshift arrangements are seen as a looming threat by the residents of the slum next to it no barrier stops the pigs rooting in the adjoining trash field from digging in the fresh ebola graves , which residents say they often do we have creatures in the community , and they dig in the graves , said henry s momoh , who lives in the adjoining slum , which residents call kolleh town they are burying the ebola patients in there , but not in the proper manner five yards from where the new graves begin , a wellused path connects the slum to the main road residents all use it , passing close to the freshly dug graves , and are frightened by the intensifying activity in the cemetery since last month , it s every day , any minute and hour , and often , they are coming to bury the ebola dead , said desmond kamara , a police officer a cloudy stream drains from the area of the new graves into the slum , further frightening the residents we are at risk , big risk , said ousman kamara , a resident we have made many complaints but the bodies , he said , keep coming even at night , he said you stand here , and you see them coming
after three years of tumultuous leadership , the museum of contemporary art in los angeles said it was nearing the end of a search for a new director and announced on monday that it had reached a fundraising milestone that would ensure it does not have to merge with another institution or face dissolution the museum , which has one of the most important collections of postwar art in the country but has struggled financially for years , said it had a combination of firm commitments and donations in hand that would raise its endowment to 100 million the amount , a goal its board members set last year , is by far the highest in the museum s history at its low point in 2008 , because of overspending and flagging investments during the recession , the endowment dwindled to only a few million from a high of more than 40 million at the beginning of the decade the billionaire collector eli broad , one of the museum s founding board members , came to the rescue , donating 15 million and pledging 15 million more to match contributions by others but the museum struggled to find donors who would allow those matching funds to be used the new fundraising drive led by wealthy board members like jeffrey soros , a nephew of the financier george soros eugenio lopez , the mexican art collector and maurice marciano , a founder of the guess clothing company will eliminate any doubt in the public s mind that we 're not here to stay , said maria seferian , the museum s interim director twice in the past six years , the museum s troubles became so acute that proposals were floated to merge it with the los angeles county museum of art , its larger neighbor to the west at the urging of mr broad , the museum also explored an agreement last year with the national gallery of art in washington that would have involved collaborations on programming and research but not a merger as the museum looks ahead to try to stabilize itself , maria arena bell , who is stepping down after the end of her term as a cochairwoman of the museum s board , said in an interview monday that there were absolutely no plans being discussed by the board for the museum to share curatorial , administrative or any other significant resources with the broad , the private contemporary art museum that mr broad and his wife , edythe , plan to open next year almost directly across the street from the main site of the museum of contemporary art on grand avenue in downtown los angeles while the two museums might collaborate on marketing strategies and have a very friendly relationship , she said , they will remain separate entities ms bell added that there were no strings attached to any of the donations or pledges that would require the museum to join forces in any way with the broads' museum even as it began to shore up its finances recently , the museum endured three rocky years under the leadership of jeffrey deitch , a veteran new york art dealer whose selection as the museum s director in 2010 was highly unconventional while his tenure included a few wellattended , critically praised exhibitions , it suffered from staff defections , budget problems and the departure of all four artists on the museum s board the artists complained that mr deitch was taking the museum too far away from serious shows and toward celebrity , fashion and pop culture after mr deitch resigned in 2013 , during the third year of a fiveyear contract , the four artists john baldessari , catherine opie , barbara kruger and ed ruscha joined the search committee for a director \( mr deitch said on monday that he was looking for a large space in new york where i can present ambitious projects \) david g johnson , the museum s other cochairman , who is also stepping down after many years on the board , said that none of the donations or pledges for the endowment were contingent upon mr deitch s leaving he added that the museum remained committed to continuing both a program of diverse artists and diverse audiences but in its search for the next director , mr johnson , ms seferian and ms bell added that the candidates considered have been museum professionals , not figures from the commercial art world or from other nonprofit institutions a director will probably be chosen in the next few weeks , the officials said
paris an international tribunal that has spent five years and more than 325 million investigating a political assassination in lebanon without making a single arrest finally got on tuesday its first look at an accused in the dock but it was none of the five men charged with complicity in the 2005 , the former lebanese prime minister rather , it was the unlikely figure of a female television executive from beirut the executive , karma alkhayat , the 31yearold vice chairwoman of al jadeed tv , had been summoned to appear at the special tribunal for lebanon on the outskirts of the hague to answer  an indictment accused ms khayat and the parent company of al jadeed , new tv , of being criminally accountable for broadcasts that involved contacting possible court witnesses and disclosing confidential information about them in 2012 it also accused them of ignoring a subsequent court order to remove the material from the company s website al jadeed broadcasts had shown blurred faces and did not disclose the names of people who it said had talked with court investigators but the indictment contended that any discussion of confidential witnesses was a serious violation that would not only put people at risk but also hinder the tribunal s functioning ms khayat was aware that the expos s would undermine public confidence in the tribunal s ability to protect the confidentiality of information , the indictment said the impact of these and other alleged leaks about witnesses is not known details were also published in a newspaper and on a hacked website the court has declined to say whether the disclosures in the news media involved significant witnesses or merely investigators' contacts , or whether anyone withdrew testimony as a result but ms khayat and al jadeed have said that they are not guilty of contempt and that they will fight the charges as an issue of freedom of the press ms khayat said in a telephone interview that an envelope was left one day at her office s reception , when she was the station s news editor it included the names of supposed witnesses and i sent a reporter to doublecheck and contact the people , she said there were names that indicated that someone inside the investigation was leaking information , she said , and we pointed that out in the story flanked by a team of lawyers on tuesday , ms khayat told the court that it was a fundamental right of journalists to investigate the work of the tribunal and the secrets that were said to have leaked from it our only crime is that we respected the highest standards of our profession , she said , speaking through a court translator i came to the tribunal to defend my rights with your laws in lebanon , where opinions about the united nationsbacked special tribunal are as deeply divided as the country itself , even supporters of the court have spoken up in defense of the journalists large posters have appeared in beirut showing a face with the tribunal s logo plastered across its mouth and the same image has appeared on various news websites the newspaper al akhbar and its editor , ibrahim alamin , have similarly been charged with contempt of court and obstruction of justice in 2013 , the newspaper published photographs , dates of birth , professions and other details about 32 people that it called confidential witnesses mr amin was not in court for the hearing tuesday , and al akhbar sent no representative mr amin and his newspaper have close ties to hezbollah , the powerful shiite movement , and have long campaigned against the special tribunal , calling it a tool of the west and israel in an editorial on tuesday , mr amin said the court was not legitimate and that he would not travel to the hague but in court , judge nicola lettieri said that mr amin had sent a letter asking for more time to put together a defense team reading from the letter on the bench , the judge , who is from italy , said mr amin described the accusations against him as very serious and that he feared for his safety as well as his family s the proceedings underline how little the court has achieved since it opened in 2009 long hampered by stonewalling and misinformation in lebanon , and by internal setbacks and delays , it began its first trial in january but the five lebanese men accused of complicity in planning the killing of mr hariri 21 others also died in the explosion are all absent the prosecution says the five men are close to hezbollah , which is part of the lebanese government and has  since january , 15 witnesses have been heard at the trial , but the proceeding have been in recess to allow defense lawyers for the fifth accused person , who was indicted in october , to catch up in the trial of the journalists , the debate about freedom of the press versus the weight of court confidentiality is likely to dominate the trial is expected to begin later this year ms khayat , who is well known as an investigative journalist , said that the lebanese people were entitled to information about the hariri killing even if the secretive tribunal was not providing it marten youssef , the court s spokesman , said the vital issue in the forthcoming trial involved defining at which point the media breaks the law when dealing with court secrecy since the start of the tribunal a lot of media have published confidential information and strong criticism , which in itself does not make for contempt of court , mr youssef said but publication with the deliberate intent of witness intimidation and interfering with the judicial process does exactly that no international court would put up with this
vatican city from the earliest days of his papacy , when he walked slowly into a grand reception hall in the apostolic palace for his first meeting with a curious diplomatic corps , pope francis has promoted a fairly conventional foreign policy agenda fight poverty , pursue peace , bridge ecumenical or interreligious divisions and protect the environment what has been unconventional is how francis has elevated that agenda through adroitly timed gestures and initiatives none more unexpected than the prayer summit meeting that he is holding on sunday with the presidents of israel and the palestinian authority he has placed himself in perhaps the world s most complex diplomatic dispute at a moment when americanled negotiations have collapsed by arguing that dialogue and prayer can help if few analysts expect any major breakthroughs , francis s summit meeting shows how he is trying to pursue his goals by positioning the vatican as an independent , global diplomatic player analysts also note that francis s status as the first latin american pope has given him credibility in the nonwestern world and is helping the vatican have influence on a broader array of issues and disputes he is planning his own global role , said alberto melloni , a vatican historian he is showing there is a space in international relations for a different diplomacy that is the purpose of this diplomatic action to show they are independent and reliable for the world centuries ago , popes dominated global affairs , starting wars or ending them , exercising enormous influence in europe and adjudicating between european powers as they expanded their colonial empires into africa and the americas papal influence was much more limited during the last century , with popes trying and failing to end both world wars the most notable exception was pope john paul ii , who is credited for his role in the collapse of communism in eastern europe when francis became pope in march 2013 , the historic nature of his papacy was framed largely in the context of the evolution of the roman catholic church having an argentine pope signaled that the catholic center of gravity had shifted from europe , where membership was stagnant , to latin america and the global south , where it was expanding but francis has since shown that his biography and popular personal style have also influenced how the vatican engages on global political issues he is hardly the first pope to speak out against poverty and inequality yet his work in the slums of buenos aires has lent him extra credibility , as has his status as a product of the developing world his first papal trip was to the italian island of lampedusa to draw attention to human trafficking and the global indifference to the thousands of refugees trying to reach europe , with many dying in the mediterranean global headlines also followed when he wrote a mildly scolding letter in january to the political and economic elites of the world economic forum in davos , switzerland , in which he decried global hunger as intolerable francis has spoken often about his concerns over the fate of christians in the middle east , and he has used this issue , as well as his broader nonviolence agenda , to insert the vatican into diplomacy in the region last september , he staged a huge prayer vigil at st peter s square as the united states and other western powers were contemplating strikes against syria the pope extended his invitation for sunday s prayer meeting during a visit last month to israel , jordan and the west bank and apparently it surprised almost everyone , underscoring the unpredictability that sometimes informs his approach one of the most resonant moments of his trip came when he made an unscheduled stop to pray beside a security barrier that israel had erected in jerusalem to some , it is surprising that a latin american pontiff who has traveled relatively little outside his home region would so assertively involve himself in the middle east but others note that the vatican has played an active role in latin american politics for decades , including mediating a dispute in the late 1970s between argentina and chile over rights to the beagle channel in latin america , the idea of papal intervention is a natural thing to think about , said , a history professor with the institute for studies of religion at baylor university vatican officials have emphasized that the pope is not planning to try to mediate specific disputes between the two sides on sunday delegations led by presidents shimon peres of israel and mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority will join francis on sunday evening in the vatican gardens for a program of jewish , muslim and christian prayers , as well as music no one presumes that peace will break out monday , the rev pierbattista pizzaballa , who is involved in planning for the prayer meeting and is the custodian of catholic properties in the holy land , said at a news conference at the vatican on friday the intent is to recreate the desire , the possibility , the dream to reopen a door that had been closed for some time

irbid , jordan when rebels want to return to syria to fight , jordan s intelligence services give them specific times to cross its border when the rebels need weapons , they make their request at an operations room in amman staffed by agents from jordan , saudi arabia and the united states during more than three years of civil war in syria , this desert nation has come to the world s attention largely because it has struggled to shelter hundreds of thousands of refugees but , quietly , jordan has also provided a staging ground for rebels and their foreign backers on syria s southern front in the joint arabamerican operations room in amman , the capital , for example , rebels say they have collected salaries as an incentive not to join betterfunded extremist groups but this covert aid has been so limited , reflecting the obama administration s reluctance to get drawn into another middle eastern conflict , that rebels say they have come to doubt that the united states still shares their goal of toppling president bashar alassad in fact , many rebels say they believe that the obama administration is giving just enough to keep the rebel cause alive , but not enough to actually help it win , as part of a dark strategy aimed at prolonging the war they say that in some cases their backers even push them to avoid attacking strategic targets , part of what they see as that effort to keep the conflict burning the aid that comes in now is only enough to keep us alive , and it covers only the lowest level of needs , said brig gen asaad alzoabi , a syrian fighter pilot who defected and now works in the operations room they call it aid , but i do n't consider it aid , he said i consider it buying time and giving people the illusion that there is aid when really there is not while much attention has been focused on syria s northern front , where rebels move in freely from neighboring turkey , the southern region has been far more controlled and despite recent reports of an invigorated southern front of rebel forces , recent interviews with more than two dozen rebel commanders , fighters and jordanian and foreign officials painted a picture of a largely stagnant southern battlefield , one that is heavily influenced by outside powers whose main goals are to limit the rise of extremists and preserve stability in jordan increasing the military threat against mr assad is not part of the plan , rebels say publicly , in nonlethal support to the syrian opposition , including rebel groups it does not consider extremist but the military aid is covert , and the countries involved have not disclosed what they provide none of this aid has significantly advanced the rebels' cause or helped achieve the american goal of a negotiated end to the war to the contrary , peace talks have been suspended indefinitely and mr assad is likely to remain president , perhaps for a long time to come but a white house spokeswoman , caitlin hayden , said on thursday that the notion that the united states wants fighting to be drawn out is flat wrong we are committed to building the capacity of the moderate opposition and seeking a way to end the bloodshed and the needless suffering of the syrian people she added there is no military solution to this conflict what is needed is a negotiated political transition the state department and the cia declined to comment , and jordan publicly denies helping any of syria s warring parties but in the towns near jordan s border with syria where many rebels keep their families and take breaks from the war , the operations room , known as the military operations command , is an open secret rebel commanders say they travel to amman to appeal to the officials there for arms and cash for their fighters we go to them , we explain what we want to do , and they ask about the target and how many fighters we have , said brig gen abdullah qarayiza , who leads a rebel group in the syrian town of nawa his arms requests had been rejected twice , he said but for each of the last two months , he said he had received 25 , 000 in cash to pay his men 50 each what is 50 for a fighter who has a wife and kids \? he said he can barely buy cigarettes rebels who have visited the operations headquarters say its decisions balance the interests of the main players saudi arabia provides funding and pushes for greater rebel support jordan manages the border and urges caution and the united states supervises , maintaining a veto on weapon shipments while the operations room has provided ammunition , rifles and antitank missiles , it refuses to provide the antiaircraft missiles that rebels say could stop the bombings of rebel towns that have killed thousands of civilians the center also coordinates a cia program to train rebel fighters that was authorized by president obama in april of last year it was supposed to provide 380 fighters a month with training , rifles , ammunition and antitank weapons so they could return to syria and train their colleagues but officials and rebel leaders say the program is actually much smaller general zoabi said that there had been three sessions in the jordanian desert with 15 to 30 fighters each , and that the training scarcely benefited fighters who already had extensive battlefield experience it s as if you take someone who runs the 100meter dash in 10 seconds and you tell him , i'm going to teach you to run it in 20 , ' he said other rebels estimated that a few hundred fighters had been trained , but even as the obama administration considers expanding the program , jordan imposes limits to try to keep the program secret it has been essentially a checkthebox exercise that has not been large enough to make a difference on the ground or to prevent the exodus of syrian men to jihadist groups that have food , money , ammunition and can take care of their people , said frederic c hof , a former state department official who is now a senior fellow at the atlantic council in washington rebels are of two minds about the support they like the that have helped against mr assad s armor , and they acknowledge that jordan s border management has prevented the chaos seen in the north , where turkey s lax border controls have helped create a freeforall zone of jihadists backed by  in the south , the nusra front , al qaeda s main affiliate in syria , is not a leading power , and the radical islamic state of iraq and syria has almost no presence the situation is good jordan controls the border and arms are not brought in randomly , said bashar alzoabi , the head of the yarmouk division , a rebel group but he was frustrated that the rebels' supporters seemed more interested in conflict management than in a victory we know that if you wanted to , you could topple bashar alassad in 10 days , he said jordan has approached the war cautiously , because its population is divided over the uprising and its leaders know they will remain next door to syria regardless of who wins the war at times , jordan has pressured the rebels to withdraw from strategic territory last year , rebels blocked the main highway between amman and damascus for more than a month , halting trade until jordan intervened with rebel leaders to open the road , said general zoabi of the military operations command in amman now , cargo trucks ply the road daily and enter jordan through a crossing still run by the syrian government , which is surrounded by rebel forces who know that attacking the facility could jeopardize their own border access some rebels played down the importance of the military operations command , saying it had no role in rebel victories like the recent and general zoabi acknowledged that its main job was to coordinate humanitarian aid and that its military support was minimal if the revolutionaries need 100 percent , what they get is 10 percent , he said other supplies are captured or purchased inside syria , he said , but that still leaves the rebels with only 50 percent of what they need like many rebels , general zoabi said he suspected that the limited aid sought to prolong the war as a way to weaken syria so that it could not threaten israel when asked why he continued to work for the military operations command , he compared himself to a man dying of thirst who can see clean water in the distance but can reach only dirty water do i die , or do i drink from the water that is n't clean \? he said i am forced to drink dirty water , but it is better for me to live than to die
