newt gingrich may have the union leader of new hampshire , but on friday , mitt romney landed his own highprofile media endorsement ramesh ponnuru , a senior editor at national review in an essay unambiguously titled romney s the one scheduled to appear in the dec 19 issue of the conservative magazine , mr ponnuru argues that mr romney is the right candidate to earn his party s nomination republicans should not be gloomy about this prospect , mr ponnuru writes romney isn t merely the candidate who is likely to win the republican primaries he s the candidate who should win them that s why he s likely to win mr ponnuru s support is also an indicator that there are still some conservatives who are moving to coalesce around mr romney as the candidate who can beat president obama next november that doesn t mean mr romney is without flaws , mr ponnuru says , acknowledging his health care plan in massachusetts was obamacare in one state he s a flipflopper inauthentic but he also points out that while concerns linger about mr romney s conservative credentials , he was to the right of senator john mccain of arizona when they both ran for president in 2008 , and he is also to the right of president george w bush  and , mr ponnuru argues , mr romney emerges from a republican party that now features a remarkable degree of programmatic consensus the narrowness of the candidates differences on pertinent issues militates in favor of picking the one who can best implement the sensible agenda they largely share , he writes it also reduces conservatives need to worry about candidates sincerity if president romney were to do an aboutface on carbon caps , the right to life , or taxes , he would be going to war with the vast majority of his party the current surge for mr gingrich , mr ponnuru predicts , is his party s latest flirtation with yet another flavorofthemonth alternative to mr romney , but that once it settles down , mr romney will most likely be the nominee and that s not a bad thing the right thing for republican voters to do now is to make romney undergo the rigors of a competitive primary and then grant him the nomination , mr ponnuru concludes my bet is that s exactly what they re going to do of course , not everyone is convinced on the same day that mr ponnuru s essay hit national review s web site , the site also published an essay by the conservative columnist charles krauthammer , titled , mitt vs newt republicans must choose between two significantly flawed frontrunners after breaking down what he sees as both mr gingrich s and mr romney s flaws , mr krauthammer comes to the grim conclusion that you play the hand you re dealt my own view is that republicans would have been better served by the candidacies of mitch daniels , paul ryan or chris christie , he writes unfortunately , none is running republicans , mr krauthammer concludes , must consider two questions who is more likely to prevent that second term \? and who , if elected , is less likely to unpleasantly surprise \?
los angeles libya s rebel leaders say they want to try col muammar elqaddafi , if and when he is captured , in libyan courts in principle , libyans deserve the satisfaction that only domestic justice can bring national trials would advance the rule of law and allow libyans to fully own their political transition one problem the international criminal court , based 1 , 400 miles away in the hague , has already issued arrest warrants for colonel qaddafi , his son and secondincommand seif alislam , and his intelligence chief , abdullah senussi the united nations security council , recognizing that colonel qaddafi s alleged crimes were not just against libyans but against humanity , asked the icc in february to investigate the situation in libya now the icc legitimately wants to try the three for atrocities committed since the uprising in libya began last winter some argue that the new libyan government would be legally bound to transfer colonel qaddafi and his associates to the hague others argue that the icc must defer to libyan authorities if they are willing and able to try colonel qaddafi fairly in their own courts a better option should satisfy both icc partisans and the new leaders of libya allow the icc to try those indicted , but to do it in libya as important as national trials are , postqaddafi libya would , at least in the short term , lack the infrastructure necessary for such complex prosecutions as in iraq soon after saddam hussein was ousted , the willingness to adhere to basic due process could be severely tested the icc , however , has the experience , expertise and legal infrastructure to try mass crimes it has put significant investigative muscle into documenting crimes committed since midfebruary a fair trial process could start fairly soon where the trials should be held is another question trial in the hague would face limitations icc proceedings normally take place far from the scene of the crime , in a foreign language , often according to rules and procedures that may be impenetrable to victim communities and the court has had difficulty educating local communities elsewhere in africa about its work , a problem that did n't occur for the special court for sierra leone in freetown and the khmer rouge tribunal in phnom penh , which are hybrid courts that have elements of international and national law and personnel an icc trial in tripoli would have practical and symbolic benefits most important , it would be closer to the communities that most need to see justice done it could involve more libyans in the proceedings , a step that would afford the icc greater access to victims and give young libyan lawyers and other professionals experience with a modern system of justice it would give the icc s staff members an opportunity to engage directly with the society for which they are doing their work , while serving as a platform for the international community to help libya rebuild the rule of law trial in tripoli , with significant libyan participation , could also signal a new direction for libya , one that favors the rule of law and integration with the institutions of international life it could foster criminal prosecutions of lowerlevel perpetrators and truthandreconciliation processes at the national level , as well as investigations of any serious crimes committed by rebel forces , a signal that the new government believes in fairness within a unified society it could give new libyan leaders some breathing room as they build their new system , while not precluding them from later trying colonel qaddafi themselves for the crimes of the past four decades an icc trial in tripoli would undoubtedly require substantial resources to build or renovate court facilities nato or other forces blessed by the security council could help arrange security for defendants in custody the icc itself would require strong security , lest it become a target for remnants of the old regime the security council , which was happy to refer libya for investigation , should help now by authorizing this kind of support and identifying sources of funds and expertise for the trial at the same time , not all proceedings need to take place in libya pretrial proceedings could begin in the hague while preparations for the actual trial move forward in tripoli none of this should seem extraordinary the nuremberg trials after world war ii drew much of their power from the fact that they took place in the country responsible for the worst crimes of the 20th century and the icc s charter , the , leaves open the possibility of trials outside the hague after decades of oppression and six months of war , libyans deserve the opportunity to bring their oppressors to justice the international community should support that kind of effort , and reinforce it by assuring the basic norms of international law for libyans , trial by the icc in tripoli should be a bridge toward taking ownership of their future
green bay , wis in any other place , they would be called souvenirs , documents suitable for framing , or even a sham but here in the heart of packers country , they are stock certificates that confer to the owner a microscopically thin and perhaps meaningless slice of the hometown team the green bay packers are the only publicly owned team in the nfl , but the value of the shares they will soon offer to fans is almost strictly of the sentimental variety they offer none of the privileges , or risks , of normal shares they do not appreciate , are not traded on an exchange and produce no dividends owners get no discounts on tickets , although some merchandise is available only to shareholders perhaps the biggest benefit is that they get to attend the annual shareholders' meeting , where they can vote on new board members and pepper management with questions yet with the economy flirting with recession and more than 475 million shares outstanding , the packers , who already have 112 , 264 shareholders , are confident that their fans will line up by the thousands to buy shares again and chances are they 're right in the coming weeks , the team expects to complete its offering of new shares according to a filing with securities regulators in utah , the packers plan to issue shares for about 250 each and fans who have closets full of brett favre jerseys and foam cheeseheads , as well as old stock certificates hanging on the wall , may well shell out hundreds of dollars for more shares , if only because they cannot resist the chance to support their team and indoctrinate the next generation we live and breathe the packers , said chuck olsen , the owner of olsen s piggly wiggly , which does a big business selling bratwursts to tailgaters on game days everyone wants to be part of this , so i 'll buy a share for my grandson , who is now 1 year old the team hopes to raise at least 22 million after fees , about what was generated in 1997 , the last time it sold shares the money will help offset some of the 143 million needed to add as many as 7 , 000 seats and replace the scoreboard and sound system at lambeau field in an era when teams routinely beg , threaten and cajole their host cities into helping them build new stadiums , the packers' approach of asking their fans to contribute is refreshingly quaint and something of a tradition the team s fans are fiercely proud of the packers' publicly owned status , which dates to 1923 when curly lambeau and four local businessmen incorporated and sold 1 , 000 shares of the team at 5 each to keep it afloat the packers also issued stock not just in 1997 , but also in 1950 and 1935 to bolster their sagging finances each time , fans snapped up the shares even though they were little more than a gift to the team unlike the growing number of teams that require fans to pay tens of thousands of dollars for personal seat licenses before they can get season tickets , the packers do not obligate anyone to buy shares \( the packers do charge ticket holders a onetime user fee to help pay for renovations , but the prices are relatively modest and the fees are refunded if they give up their tickets \) the ability to tap their fans' seemingly bottomless good will has helped the packers avoid some of the civic showdowns that have raged in other nfl cities in neighboring minnesota , for instance , the vikings have been negotiating for years with lawmakers , who are split on whether to help the team and how much the public should contribute packers shareholders helped keep the team afloat for many years but the championships of the 1960s and the nfl s decision to split its national television contracts evenly among all of its teams helped stabilize the packers and keep them in green bay , the smallest city in the league unlike teams in new york , chicago and other big cities , the packers have fewer wellheeled fans and companies that will spend money on naming rights deals , multimilliondollar sponsorships and corporate suites in 2000 , just three years after the packers won the , the team was the 23rd most valuable franchise in the nfl , according to forbes magazine so the team used all the proceeds from its 1997 share sale and the revenue from a halfpenny local sales tax increase in brown county to pay for the expansion of lambeau field in 2003 with more seats , restaurants and a new team hall of fame , the packers' revenue and profits grew this year , with a 90 record after winning the super bowl last season , the packers are the ninth most valuable franchise in the league , worth 1089 billion , according to forbes the packers do not have to ask taxpayers for help this time in addition to the share sale , the team expects to tap a capital improvement fund dedicated to upgrading the stadium , user fees from the newly added seats and loans from local banks and potentially the nfl the packers have gone to the public in the past when we were in trouble , said jason wied , vice president and general counsel of the team , who oversees stadium development so to maintain our credibility , we are not going to the taxpayer our very survival is not at stake , and we can take on this capital project ourselves this is a big relief to public officials with consumers struggling to get by , and local governments slashing services , the last thing lawmakers want to do is debate whether to raise taxes to benefit a sports team , even one as beloved as the packers if it s a priority , people find the money , said jim schmitt , the mayor of green bay , who bought shares for his three daughters in 1997 and was vice chairman of the lambeau field stadium board when the county raised taxes last time you 're not going to see these at target in a town so devoted to one team , it is not surprising that fans like to brag about going to games , say , during the vince lombardi era , or rubbing shoulders with players like bart starr there is also an informal pecking order of fans who own shares from earlier years in 1974 , richard oliver acquired four shares issued in 1950 for 25 each from his wife s aunt the shares have since split 1 , 000 to one but the original certificate hangs handsomely in his home office , where he sniffs at the notion of buying newer shares the only people buying them now are the people that want to be boastful and say to their boys at the tavern , i 've got a share of the packers , ' oliver said there s a certain amount of pride having the certificate for oliver , who ran a title business for many years , his shares were a calling card he loved to attend annual meetings , which years ago were held in a room below a bowling alley across from the courthouse oliver recalls meeting players from the 1960s teams and legends like tony canadeo it was a good old boys club , he said we knew if we ever lost the packers , it would be the death knell of the city of green bay annual meetings these days draw about 12 , 000 shareholders and guests at lambeau field at the end of july , and many of them tailgate beforehand they 're not doing that at ibm , wied said unlike a meeting at ibm , the annual packers meeting elicits few questions about the team s balance sheet instead , most concern the team and , this year , the league s newly signed collective bargaining agreement some fans suggest ways to improve the stadium shareholders vote on a slate of about 15 board members , who are almost always elected with 99 percent of the vote all in all , it is a pretty tame affair , which is not unexpected for a team that has 92 , 000 names on its waiting list for tickets , or fans rabid enough to buy a piece of paper that calls them an owner perhaps , though , if fans hang on to their shares long enough , they will be able to resell them for a handsome profit mike worachek , who runs a collectibles shop not far from lambeau field , said a share issued in 1950 could fetch 2 , 000 , while one from 1935 could bring in five times that amount their price will only rise when new shares are issued , he said still , fans are so smitten with their shares that few change hands , worachek said and even fans who have shares are likely to buy new ones as well there are a lot out there already , but packers fans are funny , he said
atlanta a republican leader in a bipartisan senate group working on a debt reduction plan said monday that threw us a little bit of a curveball with the announcement that he would deliver a speech this week on fixing the nation s fiscal problems the republican , senator of georgia , and his democratic negotiating partner , senator of virginia , said they were surprised when mr obama s senior white house strategist , david plouffe , said on sunday talk shows that mr obama would ask congress to of domestic and military spending cuts and higher taxes for the wealthy people familiar with the senate group said mr obama s entry into the fiscal debate could upset the senators' fragile unity if the effort becomes associated with him before there is a deal , they say , it could provoke such conservative opposition that republican lawmakers will shy away we just did n't know none of us did until yesterday , mr chambliss said , referring to the three republican and three democratic senators in the socalled  irrespective of that , we 're going to continue working with our group , he told reporters at the rotary club of atlanta , where he and mr warner addressed about 400 receptive business people on the need for both revenues and spending cuts to rein in projected debt mr warner said , to get this done , we 're going to need the president s involvement and the president s leadership the senators said their group was close to a deal but would not announce one this week with congress about to recess for two weeks , they worry that opponents on the left and right would savage the plan in the interim administration officials had believed the senators would announce agreement this week that was a consideration in scheduling mr obama s speech the officials said a deal would suggest momentum for the broader bipartisan negotiations that mr obama seeks and contrast with what is expected to be divisive debate this week in the house over a republican budget that would cut domestic spending deeply , including for and , but largely spare the military and cut tax revenues mr chambliss praised the house republicans plan as very serious but said it would not balance the budget for decades because it seeks to do so simply by reducing spending , and that s not going to work the senators told the audience that their goal was a plan to cut 4 trillion from deficits over the next 10 years relevant committees would be instructed to reduce military and domestic spending , including for the medicare , medicaid and programs , and overhaul the tax code to end many tax breaks and use the new revenues to lower tax rates and reduce deficits their framework is last year s majority report of mr obama s , which included four of the six senators , but not mr chambliss and mr warner

a small group of lawmakers gathered last month in pakistan s army headquarters , where the country s head of military operations , maj gen ashfaq nadeem , stiffened their resolve about the threat from india he warned of one indian capability in particular india s cold start army doctrine cold start is rawalpindi s favorite bogeyman but what is it \? in the words of a cable released by wikileaks , it is a mixture of myth and reality as i argue in a forthcoming paper in the journal of strategic studies , it tells us a little about the aspirations of indian officers , but a lot about the fears real , imagined and contrived of their pakistani counterparts to understand cold start , it s worth thinking about how india s military thinking has evolved in the nuclear age india has won nearly every war it has fought against pakistan perhaps that s why nuclear weapons have always gnawed at the indian army , long before either country got the bomb senior officers thought long and hard about how pakistan s nuclear program would blunt india s superiority in numbers pakistan already had its ways of needling india pakistan s intelligence service , the isi , poured fuel onto the flames of the kashmir insurgency which began at the end of the 1980s india s generals could only fume then came kargil , a brazen but limited strike across the line of control , in 1999 if pakistan could launch such an offensive , asked the top brass , couldn t india do the same \? after exploding five nuclear bombs in 1998 , didn t delhi have its own shield from behind which it could parry the many blows of islamabad s covert war \? that logic was tested in 2002 the militant group lashkaretaiba precipitated an international crisis by assaulting india s parliament new delhi rushed to respond a million men were mobilized by both sides and india spent 2 billion eight hundred soldiers died in accidents and skirmishes making the exercise deadlier than kargil , an actual war a year later , india slunk back , having extracted some desultory and quickly reversed promises by thenpresident pervez musharraf to curb terrorism the army , whose lower ranks were apoplectic at being held back , made a simple diagnosis india had taken too long to move its ponderous strike corps from the country s heartland to the front line as the weeks passed , the international community built up a crescendo of calls for restraint , and the element of surprise was lost moreover , this was still the army that had cut pakistan in half in 1971 it was trained to thrust toward the indus and throw the enemy off balance but in the nuclear age , that sort of total victory was so reckless as to become impossible maj gen dk palit , one of the few soldierscholars in the history of the indian army , once noted that wars between india and pakistan resembled communal riots with armor the challenge in the nuclear age was to keep them like that so the army had to become suppler , quicker to rise \( hence cold start \) , nimbler on its feet , less of a hatchet and more of a scalpel it was reorganized into eight socalled battle groups , modeled on old israeli and soviet formations each would punch into pakistan at unpredictable points , but to a much shallower depth and therefore below the imagined nuclear threshold only if war could be limited , went this argument , could it be credibly threatened in pakistan , these efforts were taken as evidence of indian perfidy but the irony is that india would struggle to carry out anything as clinical and swift as cold start its army faces basic problems of nuclear strategy , politics and basic readiness what would india do , for example , if pakistan used nuclear weapons to attack advancing indian forces \? india , despite its avowed promise to retaliate to any nuclear strike , is unlikely to incinerate islamabad in return for an attack on its tanks but the deeper issue has nothing to do with pakistan and everything to do with india s political dna unlike in pakistan , where the military casts a long shadow over civilian leaders , indian civilians don t trust their military to handle nukes as warfighting instruments and even without this nuclear shadow , civilians are unwilling to greenlight an army doctrine that could spiral beyond their control in a crisis they are frightened of what ajp taylor said of war in 1914 imposed on the statesmen of europe by railway timetables as a pakistani naval officer hinted last week , pakistan s generals have fallen into the simplest of cognitive traps mirrorimaging by assuming that the indian army s plans are automatically national policy indeed , in india the army is kept on a leash tighter than that of nearly any democratic country is this ambiguity a good thing for india , if it leaves pakistan guessing \? cold start has been a public relations disaster for india , allowing pakistani officials to paint india as a jingoistic bully  yet even if the taciturn manmohan singh was in a jingoistic mood , not everything would go smoothly the indian army developed cold start on its own , so it s no surprise that the air force which would prefer strategic bombing to close air support , but whose role is essential to the battle group concept considers the whole thing a concept dead at inception there s more when the cabinet mulled over retaliatory options after the mumbai attacks of november 2008 , the poor state of the armory was a serious constraint for example , the army only acquired a third of necessary tanks between 2002 and 2007 ammunition holdings are way below necessary levels , and there s a shortage of more than 10 , 000 officers this mess can t be laid at the generals feet , since these failures are mostly rooted in essentially political pathologies such as civilian apathy toward strategic affairs and a dysfunctional procurement system none of this means that a military offensive is necessarily the ideal response to a terrorist act , or that india lacks options altogether no indian government could survive another serious attack traced to pakistan unless it responded robustly but the mythologies of cold start the embellishment of india s efforts to keep fighting communal riots with armor is the product of a strange interplay between an indian army still striving for relevance in the nuclear milieu , and a pakistani military establishment that sees the ghosts of 1971 lurking over the plains and mountains of sindh , punjab and kashmir shashank joshi is a doctoral student at harvard university and an associate fellow at the royal united services institute you can follow him on
glendale , ariz zack greinke made his first exhibition appearance for the milwaukee brewers on tuesday , walking three of his eight hitters but not feeling too bad about it he missed with a few high fastballs , and is learning a different curveball grip his side muscle bothers him a little , but he said it was improving the ball felt good leaving his hand we know this because greinke spoke with reporters after facing the chicago white sox at camelback ranch it was one of the rare times we get to hear from greinke , who speaks to reporters only after he pitches , the ground rules for someone who has dealt with socialanxiety disorder by many accounts , greinke is a fascinating guy , blunt in his answers , not concerned with public reaction at the brewers fan fest in late january , he actually predicted that pittsburgh would beat green bay in the super bowl so much for that a handful of outoftown writers covered his start on tuesday , including one from kansas city , where he pitched until his trade to the brewers this winter greinke laughed when he recognized the kansas city writer , and made him repeat his question greinke was not really interested in revisiting his departure from kansas city , but over 18 casual , fairly relaxed minutes with the news media , he explained why he believed he had to make his trade request public eventually i need to stop answering questions about this , but i kind of had to play the bad guy in order to do it , greinke said i mean , it d be nice if it didn t happen but the way things were in kansas city , if i had just kept on being this great person , then fans would have been outraged if i got traded i kind of had to be the bad guy for a while , which isn t always your no 1 choice why did he have to be the bad guy \? because the fans , i don t know why , but it seemed like they really liked me , he said as the general manager or coach or owner of the team , the fans recognize what you do , and if you do something that none of the fans like , there s going to be backlash against the organization so if you make it to where they can understand why the general managers and owners did what they did , it s not as bad a situation for them , and it makes it easier to make the move he paused i m gonna try to do it , i m not sure , but that will probably be the last question i answer about the past , greinke said so that s my goal greinke , who struck out two and allowed one hit and no runs on tuesday , gushed about his new team the brewers acquired another solid starter , shaun marcum , for the rotation , and decided to keep prince fielder in his freeagent walk year these are not the rebuilding royals the team s awesome , at least on paper , greinke said it s just a great team you look around , and there are superstars all around , pretty much and a lot of us are locked up for a couple of years so it s pretty neat to see greinke is one of three brewers who started on opening day last season yovani gallardo did it for milwaukee and marcum for toronto and manager ron roenicke has not given anyone the assignment yet for this year greinke sounded more interested in finding out which brewers pitcher will be the best hitter , and he compared himself to ryan braun , the team s allstar left fielder i m kind of like ryan braun , where i swing really hard , greinke said his handeye coordination is pretty amazing hopefully mine is too , but probably not that good , obviously i m a little guy , but i have a little power for being small greinke is 4 for 24 as a hitter , with one home run the brewers acquired him for his arm , of course , and hope he can help them back to the postseason , which they have missed the last two years greinke has never been there when the season starts if we re winning when we re winning i would think it d be a lot more fun , he said
i m finding it hard to figure out what , exactly , republicans think about vegetables herman cain , who as we know always chooses his words with the greatest of care , called vegetable pizza sissy pizza on monday but house republicans are suggesting that pizza is itself a vegetable so does that mean all pizza is for sissies \? as ridiculous as the preceding paragraph sounds , believe me , it is no more so than the final version of a spending bill released late monday , which would nix usda school lunch standards proposed earlier in 2011 and let pizza count as a vegetable \( the sissy addendum is not in there \) the background is that federally subsidized lunches have to contain a certain number of vegetables but what , exactly , is a vegetable \? to make things extra confusing , the bill doesn t mention pizza but rather tomato paste it specifies that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement an interim final or final rule regarding nutrition programs that require the crediting of tomato paste and puree based on volume according to the ap , this nonsense means that two tablespoons of paste are sufficient for vegetablehood as long as lunch ladies bake two tablespoons of paste into their pizza , it s a vegetable i asked verlyn klinkenborg , who writes about agriculture and the environment for the editorial board , for his thoughts on the vegetal nature of pizza for me , the most interesting thing about this is how you turn language of the kind you find in the ag appropriations bill into pizza and vegetables on the face of it , it s almost impossible to tell what s being said but then , that s part of the point rather than revealing what the real subject is and who stands to lose or gain from it we re left with this truly indigestible wordstuff even ag experts \( meaning , roughly , me \) have a hard time moving from the text to the fact that this is really an industry move to feed school kids pizza the thinking seems to be that anything that has once been a vegetable remains a vegetable , no matter what form it ultimately takes and it has the unique property of turning anything it touches into a vegetable too no one in congress seems to realize that tomatoes are , in fact , fruits , but that s a separate issue
milwaukee prince fielder started it , naturally , since every gesture and celebration by the seems to emanate from him whenever a brewer gets a hit or makes a nice play , fielder , the bearlike first baseman , flexes his arms forward as if trying to hug a sequoia , and the player flashes it back bloop or blast , it does not matter a grunt tops it off in game 2 of the brewers' national league division series on sunday , ryan braun was so jazzed by his tworun homer in the first inning a that cleared the back wall in center field , to the left of the batter s eye that he stopped after crossing the plate to give beast mode to the towelwaving capacity crowd at miller park the fans went wild , and braun moved on to engage fielder , the ondeck hitter , in their customary boxinglike , bobandweave home run celebration by the third inning of , fielder had gone beast mode six times to five teammates and had accepted one such salute himself the brewers needed all the offense they could muster on a day when zack greinke , 110 at home this season but making his second consecutive start on three days' rest , gave up three homers and four runs in five innings while failing to hold a 41 lead in a 44 game , it took a perfectly executed squeeze bunt by jonathan lucroy or , as corey hart called him , mr squeeze and an arizona meltdown in a fiverun sixth inning to give the brewers a 20 lead in this bestoffive series , which shifts to arizona for game 3 on tuesday suddenly the brewers , who were brushed aside in four games by philadelphia in a 2008 division series , are one victory from winning a playoff series for the first time since 1982 in '08 , we kind of limped into the playoffs , hart said we were struggling late , and the nervousness was always there we were always worried about winning games and what might happen this year , we 're confident we 're a better team as a whole when we go out there , we feel we have a much better chance to win milwaukee , which had the best home record in baseball , pounced in the sixth after arizona reliever brad ziegler balked jerry hairston jr to third flustered , ziegler walked yuniesky betancourt on four pitches this is not easy to do betancourt walked only 16 times all season with hairston breaking for home , lucroy who this season won a game with a suicide squeeze lucroy has bunted so often that arizona manager kirk gibson said his team expected it but ziegler , instead of tagging lucroy , launched a backhanded flip past catcher miguel montero for an error , putting runners on second and third in that situation , you just want to try and take your out , gibson said but he did n't do it lucroy , who hits eighth , said where i am in the lineup , sometimes you get called on to do strange things , especially with the pitcher batting behind you it s a free rbi if you execute gibson ordered pinchhitter mark kotsay intentionally walked hart , nyjer morgan and braun then strung consecutive singles on four pitches for four runs , with braun finished 3 for 4 with three runs batted in , his second consecutive threehit game in the series when morgan , one of milwaukee s most popular players , reached first , he energetically flashed beast mode to the firstbase stands fielder said the gesture came from repeated viewings of the movie monsters inc with his two children braun said it s fun i think the fans have really embraced the personality of our team , and specifically this beast mode thing it gets all of us fired up , and the fans really enjoy being a part of it they 've been such an important part of our success here at home , that whenever you get them into the game that much more , it can only be advantageous for us the led the majors with 48 comefrombehind victories , and they had chances late , putting runners in scoring position in each of the last four innings none scored arizona was 0 for 10 with runners in scoring position over all brewers closer john axford walked two in the ninth before finishing off the bullpen s fourth consecutive scoreless inning inside pitch milwaukee manager ron roenicke started jerry hairston jr again at third base , a bold move since casey mcgehee was 5 for 5 against arizona starter daniel hudson just going with who i think is hot , roenicke said hairston ended the season 9 for 22 \( 409 \) mcgehee finished 5 for 58 \( 086 \) hairston went 2 for 4 on sunday

the language rick perry used to describe social security in a usa today opinion article on monday was anything but inflammatory and strikingly different in tone than his recent book and statements on the campaign trail we must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix social security and make it financially viable for generations to come , he wrote in the short piece for the newspaper compare that to what mr perry wrote on page 61 of his book , fed up !  ponzi schemes like the one that sent bernard madoff to prison are illegal in this country for a reason , mr perry wrote , not mincing any words in a tough comparison they are fraudulent systems designed to take in a lot of money at the front and pay out none in the end this unsustainable fiscal insanity is the true legacy of social security and the new deal that rhetoric has stirred controversy among some of his fellow republicans who worry that it would make it tougher for him to defeat president obama if he becomes the party s nominee what he said may be technically true , mike huckabee , a former presidential candidate and governor of arkansas , said on a radio show on monday but you go to south florida , mr huckabee continued , where you have a lot of retired people and essentially say social security is a criminal enterprise , that s problematic but since becoming a candidate , mr perry has repeatedly declined to back away from the book s more inflammatory oratory about social security in fact , he has since called the program a monstrous lie , saying that politicians are not telling young people the truth about the program s future in an interview monday , mr perry s spokesman reiterated that point don t look for him tonight , tomorrow or a year from now to back away from anything he s said , mark miner , the spokesman , said the public wants people to start talking straight with them we re not going to change words or sugarcoat things for the sake of an election pressed on the difference in tone , mr miner insisted that mr perry will not back away from any of his earlier remarks and writings when it comes to social security the governor doesn t run from what he says , mr miner said there is no plan to run from this issue and yet the article in usa today seems to be a departure , at least in tone in the book , he wrote that social security was the best example of programs that are violently tossing aside any respect for our founding principles of federalism and limited government in the usa today article , he wrote that americans must come together and agree to address the problems so today s beneficiaries and tomorrow s retirees really can count on social security for the long haul in the book , he complained that social security is something we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now in the usa today article , he said that social security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected for younger workers , we must consider reforms to make social security financially viable in the book , he wrote that by any measure , social security is a failure in usa today , he said that we must have a frank , honest national conversation about fixing social security in the book , mr perry also acknowledges the kind of political attacks he would get and is now getting because of his words now , if you say social security is a failure , as i have just done , you will inherit the wind of political scorn , he wrote in the book , which was published a year ago seniors might think you want to cut the benefits they have paid for politicians will seek to take advantage , stirring up fear about benefits that will be lost if you elect another heartless republican i get it the implication in that passage is that a politician should stick to his guns on the social security message so far , he s done that but the usa today article suggests there might be room for a bit of a change in tone , if nothing else tonight s debate could be very interesting
those mourning the slow , steady decline of the franco zeffirelli era at the metropolitan opera can take solace in the fact that a crucial element of his directorial vision remains intact his mystifying predilection for live animals onstage david mcvicar s new production of donizetti s anna bolena , which opened last week , for some reason included two irish wolfhounds , and the placid donkey remains in the revival of of rossini s barbiere di siviglia that opened on saturday afternoon the donkey is excellent , but there is also human interest in this entertaining revival , which features an assured performance by the 29yearold mezzosoprano in her first prima donna role at the met for once well , since the 20045 season rosina is being performed by a singer not named damrau , didonato or garanca in other words , not by a star but the alert and charming ms leonard , a moving dorabella in mozart s cos fan tutte last season , makes the part her own she has a cool , lithe voice that was a bit brittle in una voce poco fa but agile and sensuous in contro un cor , the virtuosic aria rosina sings during her voice lesson , turned romantic rendezvous and she is at her best in intimate passing moments , like the meltingly poignant line of recitative just before the storm what a cruel , cruel fate is mine the tenor , who sings pleasantly and elegantly in lyrical passages , made his met debut as a game count almaviva , rosina s frustrated love interest in coloratura mr camarena is more labored than dashing or suave , particularly to an audience used to hearing juan diego fl rez and lawrence brownlee sing the role with stylish ease , but he gets the job done , and he caps his arias with the clarion high c s that audiences adore in the pit maurizio benini struggled to keep the ensemble together his tempos sometimes lagged , but even when they were swift , the orchestra lacked energy and momentum the first week of the met s season centered on italian operas composed over just 26 years in the early 19th century barbiere , bolena and verdi s nabucco but none of the three has had the crispness of rhythm and sharpness of focus required to make this repertory simmer with tension in barbiere , dr bartolo \( the bassbaritone maurizio muraro \) and don basilio \( the veteran bass paata burchuladze \) were both their usual broadly comic selves but the commanding baritone peter mattei sang figaro , usually a jovial lug , with a provocative edge of bitterness and savagery that served as a tonic to the twee excesses that remain part of mr sher s clever production , like the sneezing jokes and the singers vibrating to the beat of the patter at the end of act i michael yeargan s set still has the gently whitewashed , fakeantique aesthetic of a restoration hardware store and is still flooded with lighting \( by christopher akerlind \) that is intended to be honeyed but comes across as jaundiced and that hardworking donkey still pads pointlessly across the stage
one recent friday , the orthopedic surgeon victor khabie performed seven operations , grabbed a sandwich and fought traffic to a ballroom in queens to care for athletes who walked willingly into fists they call themselves boxers khabie calls them patients this presents a contradiction for khabie and other doctors who moonlight as ringside physicians they come from the world of medicine , which is predicated on healing , into the world of boxing , which is predicated on pain khabie must reconcile these worlds , for a few hundred dollars a fight , while his patients cut , bruise and disfigure each other for sport it s tough , but we do the best we can for them , khabie said if society says we do n't want boxing , then i would n't be taking care of boxers but i'm not a politician i do know these boxers need help , these boxers are hurt , and often they have no one to take care of them on saturday , the heavyweight champion wladimir klitschko defeated david haye in germany in a fight shown on hbo khabie watched both boxers and the physicians who watched over them in 2006 , he examined klitschko before a bout at madison square garden that fight , with the boxer laila ali on the undercard and her father , muhammad ali , in attendance , served as a career highlight just like the time evander holyfield raised his left glove between rounds when khabie instructed him to lift his right , inadvertently smacking khabie in the face khabie long ago learned the violence inherent in his favorite sport he tried boxing with a friend and ended up with broken ribs his wife , brenda , told khabie you 're a surgeon you need those hands but she also understood that the violence , so different from his daily routines , drew him ringside in the first place if he was n't a surgeon , she said , he 'd be a boxer by day , khabie can be found in mount kisco , ny , where he is the chief of sports medicine at northern westchester hospital and also helps operate the somers orthopedic surgery and sports medicine group on fight nights , he makes a mental switch , from repairer of torn ligaments and busted knees to caretaker of battered faces , from central figure in the operating room to anonymous face at ringside khabie described his job like this between rounds , he fights through camera crews and trainers into a designated corner , where he attempts to pepper a boxer who is often injured and trying to catch his breath with questions for 10 to 15 seconds he then makes a decision on whether the bout should continue , one he must live with through the next round if all goes well , khabie operates unseen this being boxing , all goes well means none of the combatants end up in the hospital those are the fights that stick with khabie , that keep him awake at night , like a bout a few years ago at a beer garden on long island where a boxer was knocked unconscious for five minutes that felt like five hours , the boxer did not move khabie never expected to work in boxing , but knew early he would become a doctor , even back in boy scouts when his favorite tasks included constructing a bandage in the woods a longtime sports fan , he entered orthopedics because they combined both passions , because the first time he removed a screw from a leg , his instructors asked not about removal technique , but about a football game the night before after college at the university of pennsylvania and harvard medical school , khabie worked at the kerlanjobe orthopedic clinic in california there , he served as assistant physician for the professional sports teams in los angeles lakers center shaquille o'neal occasionally pulled pranks on him khabie enjoyed caring for athletes \( as an assistant doctor , he examined and called in a prescription for the tennis champion steffi graf at the \) but boxing , with no place to hide , all the energy and raw aggression , drew him in his first bout as a ringside physician took place at a cafe in the bronx , which later became a red lobster and had a makeshift ring inside on the recent friday in queens , khabie called his work typical eight fights , three boxers knocked down , two repeatedly , one serious gash opened by a head butt in one bout , bryan abraham sent scott burrell to the canvas four times each time , khabie scurried into the ring because burrell rose quickly from each knockdown , because he remained relatively calm , khabie let the fight continue \( khabie finds that fighters who become overly emotional , begging to continue , usually need to be stopped \) khabie paid particular attention two fights later he knew that one boxer , carlos cisneros , was 35 , with 17 losses in 27 previous fights \( cisneros lost by knockout \) as khabie attended to cisneros , the surgeon from westchester appeared at home he likes to have that peacefulness and that action , his brother , dan khabie , said that s very much our personality at home , we 're relaxed and civilized put us in a ring , and we 'll go nuts yet part of khabie s role as ringside physician includes making an unsafe sport more safe , or trying to he echoed melvina lathan , the chairwoman of the new york state athletic commission , who noted the rules governing fights in new york were more stringent than most states , if not all khabie spoke of the wide range of specialists available to boxers \( orthopedists , oral surgeons , eye doctors , plastic surgeons \) and the seminars they conduct each year khabie said doctors began using more sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging testing in recent years research has been conducted on whether larger gloves would reduce the force of blows fighters are also required to have brain testing every three years , yearly eye and heart exams , and blood work and mental exams before each fight but they will never be truly safe boxing is a violent sport , khabie said but like football , it can be made safer we 've had 60day suspensions for concussions imagine that in football we 've taken every precaution we possibly can but , unfortunately , people will get hurt recently , an 80yearold amateur traveled to khabie s office , certain that if any doctor would clear him to fight , it would be a boxing one khabie did not clear the man , but he returned a few months later and dropped the belt he won on khabie s desk so goes the life of a ringside physician , where safety is both relative and paramount
elk grove , calif the firm owned by the internationally renowned architect is in high demand these days , designing projects in hong kong , milan and seoul , not to mention the london aquatics center , the swimming arena for the 2012 olympics but one of the firm s smaller clients , the city of elk grove , population 153 , 000 , recently conjured far different kinds of aquatic life when members of the city council and the public chose words like squid , octopus and starfish to describe the latest renderings for a proposed civic center other descriptions were more alien than aquatic one councilman described the architectural study as an animal from a different planet , while the mayor , steven detrick , said he was expecting to hear the theme from star wars' to start playing during the presentation none of these comments were intended as compliments but it was n't always this way as the economy inches back toward stability , some cities are beginning to dust off their prerecession playbooks and dream big again and few cities were moving as quickly before the financial crisis as this sacramento suburb , which the census bureau proclaimed america s fastestgrowing city in 2006 it was then that elk grove , incorporated in 2000 , held an international design competition to create a master plan for a 159 million civic center complex on 78 acres the project was to include a performing arts center , library , youth sports complexes , convention space and more the council hoped that an iconic piece of architecture could vault the young city to higher heights , la bilbao in spain and its guggenheim museum and so , this suburban community where city council agendas have included discussions on topics like how to deal with rampant beaver dams , chose ms hadid , a baghdadborn , londonbased architect known for soaring biomorphic shapes that make frank gehry s work look tame the mayor was thrilled that they had landed such a big fish we hit a home run on this one , gushed james cooper , the mayor at the time the citizens are so excited the big thing is to let her be an architect and not stifle the process we want her to think of something different this is a new chapter in elk grove s life it was a chapter , though , that ended with the recession and the idea gathered dust until last summer , when the city resumed its relationship with ms hadid s firm to fashion the center s master plan , the process in which the scale and proximity of the structures is determined , though the actual design of individual buildings will be decided later but one important factor had changed since she was first selected three of the five city council members were new , and one of the most vocal opponents of the hadid selection in 2006 was now mayor so perhaps it was no surprise that the council members did not attend any of the meetings some of which included very positive comments from the public over the nine months of planning until the final presentation of the master plan last week it was listed as an agenda item three hours into the regular wednesday night council meeting , after a long debate on rowdy bowling alley patrons the stormy evening began with roughly 70 people in attendance , but dwindled to about 17 two of whom were earnestly knitting by the time the hadid project architect , bozana komljenovic , took the podium the architect showed two versions , both consistent with ms hadid s bold style , and explained how she had arrived at them only two people spoke , including one woman whose voice shook with anger who is going to pay for this monster \? she demanded between references to the squid and starfish and scifi imagery this is not elk grove her only compliment was that at least they put some landscaping between the tentacles this is more like something i 'd see in dubai than elk grove , added mayor detrick who , like the other council members present , was struggling to see past the design to the master plan itself the lone voice of support came from mr cooper , now the vice mayor city officials hope to break ground on the first part of the complex next year the only agreement reached by the council last week was that the starfish design had the preferred density , which left more room for softball and soccer fields ms komljenovic defended the work the next day they asked us to provide an iconic element that would create a draw from outside of elk grove , she said i assume that s why we were brought in to begin with one unabashed fan is the city s planning director , taro echiburu , who expects to start a new competition for the design stage this summer and hopes that ms hadid s firm will participate i loved the designs , he said informed , however , that the mayor said he was unlikely to support any project proposed by ms hadid s firm , mr echiburu insists that he still hopes for the best i 'll be disappointed if this ends up as anytown , usa , he said
lille may be the kings of freeflowing french football , but on wednesday night in their opening bow in this year s champions league they learned a valuable lesson attack isn t always the best form of defense especially when your defense is found wanting lille , the reigning ligue 1 champion that swept all before it to win its first french title since 1954 , opened its account with a 22 tie at the stade metropole against a cska moscow side bereft of ideas and short on talent for 80 minutes cska were distinctly second best and yet the hosts conceded two late goals as seydou doumbia made the most of worrying defensive frailties to earn cska a point it was a robbery so painful that had the local gendarmes been called , no one of a russian persuasion could have mustered a single complaint what had propelled lille so majestically to europe s top competition had cost them dearly as manager rudi garcia looked on from the stands , serving a one game touchline ban , his energetic and entertaining side faltered garcia s style , nurtured by his father and unleashed managerially , first upon dijon and then le mans teams he transformed is one of attack , of a flowing 433 system that allows players to play that seems such an odd statement and yet managers , especially in the somewhat repressed french premier division , rarely break from the mundane the deathbypassing style of barcelona and to a lesser extent , arsenal , would be treated with a je ne comprends pas in much of ligue 1 not though by garcia , and that s what has made his team such a breath of fresh air it is an approach that also served him well as a player , most notably with lille and fellow northerners caen and , since 2008 , as manager of les dogues his mantra is that talent wins he embraces creativity and allows it to breathe the brazilian michel bastos flourished under his stewardship and garcia has turned the belgian prodigy eden hazard into arguably the best young attacking force in european soccer it was no surprise either that garcia felt he could find a home for the fallen star joe cole in the final hours of the european transfer window cole , who began to lose his way long before he joined liverpool last summer , should be reinvigorated under the watchful eye of the 47yearold garcia on wednesday , lille s game followed a similar pattern to much of its 201011 league campaign for long periods it dominated florent balmont ran the game from midfield , ably assisted by ludovic obraniak , benoit pedretti and hazard , who drifted around the field making it difficult for defenders to pick him up , often popping up in midfield the way wayne rooney has done at manchester united to such acclaim however , unlike the lille of the past 12 months there was a very different final scene the key to lille s success , beyond all the goals , of which there were many 68 was a defense that was breached just 36 times in 38 games \( only rennes , by one , conceded fewer goals \) led by the talented center backs adil rami and aurelien chedjou , a cameroon international , and protected by midfielder yohan cabaye , lille were difficult to break down in only six games did they concede more than one goal , and in 11 they allowed none at all but rami left for valencia at the start of the summer , having signed a precontract agreement with the spaniards in january cabaye surprised many by joining newcastle united and chedjou sustained a thigh injury last weekend in a win over saint etienne \( he was replaced against cska by the unconvincing david rozehnal \) do not pass go became open all hours for a back four put under late pressure by a russian side that saw a chink become a crack and a crack become a chasm as it chased a game it had no right to be in still , lille could have won had cole made more of the chance that fell to him in injury time after doumbia s rescue act profligacy in front of goal hurt the french champions throughout the 90 minutes , but more worrying for garcia will be the capitulation at the back group b is one of the competition s more difficult brackets , as trabzonspor proved by beating inter milan at the san siro next up for lille is a trip to turkey and the huseyin avni aker stadium at the end of september no easy task the return match with cska in the freezing temperatures of a late november evening , sandwiched between two games with inter will be no walk in the proverbial park , or c est pas une ballade dans le parc chedjou should have returned to the fold by then , and his partnership with marko basa should have had time to bed in a little more whether garcia will be able to curb his own attacking tendencies is not clear in the postmatch news conference on wednesday night he told reporters that as long as we play our game , everything is going our way whether his way is the right way in this years champions league remains to be seen , but if lille concede seemingly winning positions too often it will be a disappointing early exit for a team whose attacking flair deserves to grace the latter stages of the competition
last week the times reached a strategic frontier with the for digital access to its content perhaps less visibly , but also importantly , the newsroom has moved toward a remarkable integration of its print and electronic operations the organization has evolved to a new state , one that lives online and expects to be paid for it this suggests to me a companion move the times should make , one that would help secure a tighter bond with its audience publishing the times s journalism policies in a searchable format and in a visible location on that would enable readers to see more clearly into the news operation people use the internet to satisfy their information needs , and information about the times is no different the times should step out ahead of its industry peers by creating a readerfriendly portal to its policies on ethics , style and usage , blogging , anonymous sources , social networking and other subjects that readers and journalists care about i envision a link on the left side of the nytimescom home page that would take you to a journalism policies page where you could locate topics using a search tool right now , finding times policies is a bit of a treasure hunt some are available on a slightly different group of policies an industry group that posts the policies of many newspapers yet another version of some policies covering the new york times company s broader group of news organizations is available nowhere online can you find rules on style and usage though they already exist on the newsroom s internal site or the policy on social networking and none of the material is truly searchable i'm not faulting the substance of the times s policies spawned an intensive effort to strengthen standards and codify them taken together , the entire corpus of rules and policy is substantial one could argue over some of the specifics , but as a demonstration of intent and commitment , it is an impressive statement i broached the idea of a searchable policies portal with the times s associate managing editor for standards , and he duly reminded me of the organization s efforts to date to be much more open and transparent in telling our readers what our standards are then he added a note of caution such a project , he said , would take a lot of time and effort some times policies address issues that are very new and fastchanging and would need periodic updating other policies , like the one governing social media , are not so much a set of rules as a broad governing statement indeed , building the portal would require considerable programming time and might also lead to revisiting some of the policies themselves once in existence , it would need to be monitored and updated the costs could be substantial , though nothing compared with the millions that the times spent to build and launch its pay model and , to be honest , there are other reasons besides cost not to do this an expert in journalism ethics who advocates for strong standards and accountability , pointed out one of them the risk , he said , is that when you put your ethics standards and practices on the cybertable , if you will , the heightened accessibility and the growing tendency of the public to throw brickbats will lead to a lot of headaches as the times s fourth public editor , i can understand what mr steele is saying and what the times potentially has to fear the times is on the receiving end of an extraordinary volume of feedback , some of it very negative , from bloggers , television pundits and readers at large the times spends considerable resources to receive and respond to this input at times , the feedback overwhelms the system , as happened recently when complaints about a march 8 article on went viral and buried my email inbox under tens of thousands of messages mr steele , head of the , argues that this is not a reason to shrink from the task we have to accept that reality and the risk , he said journalism shines the light of scrutiny on the powerful we look at the power company , oil companies , hospitals , universities , government institutions and other corporations it is hypocritical if we are not willing to be scrutinized by the public for the way we carry out our work part of that is being clear about what our standards and ethical principles are if the times were to take the step i advocate , it would be out ahead of the pack i visited the web sites of a number of leading news organizations and struggled to find their policies this reflects a deep ambivalence on the part of news organizations , i think since the 1990s , many have adopted ethics policies to build trust with readers during a time when polls show erosion of public confidence in journalists but formulating such policies and publicizing them are two different things , as mr steele attests the ambivalence is n't doing journalists any good gallup polling last year showed that public faith had declined for the fourth year in a row , with to report the news fully , accurately and fairly the simple truth is that more needs to be done to repair the damage as a kansas university journalism professor , told me , the industry looks to the times to set standards the times can play this leadership role and also build a stronger compact with its readers by inviting them inside it s not a panacea to put these policies online , said ms fine , who is also cochairwoman of the ethics committee of the it is still not going to explain why stories were held , why some people were included in stories and some were n't but it will help increase trust , understanding and accountability the times has a good set of policies it should double down on its commitment to high standards by organizing them into a

sometimes people surprise you for more than 20 years , hank williams jr sang his adapted version of all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight to open monday night football over the years , the production values grew but the message stayed the same are you ready for some football \? the musical bit traveled with monday night from abc to although it has grown stale , it was harmless and there was no reason to think about williams s rightwing politics then on monday , williams compared president obama to hitler he described the round of golf between obama and house speaker john a boehner last summer as hitler playing golf with netanyahu referring to israel s prime minister , benjamin netanyahu then punctuated his political tirade by calling obama and vice president joseph r biden jr the enemy espn quickly pulled williams s opener from monday s indianapolistampa bay game \( the national anthem replaced the song \) and left open further action against him williams has issued two statements , one an apology of sorts , the second a condemnation of news media characterizations of tea party members as racist and extremist he admitted that his comment was extreme but said he did it to make a point he was seeking an analogy to express polar opposites who would never agree on anything he canceled a followup appearance tuesday night on fox news channel espn is contemplating whether to cut ties to williams , who is not an employee and is tangential to the company s success comparing obama to the epitome of pure evil seems a dismissible offense but espn executives could conclude that williams s contrition is sufficient \( despite the semisincere if i offended anyone part of his de rigueur celebrity apology \) and declare a oneweek suspension adequate but james miller , the coauthor of a recent book about espn , said that the importance of monday night to the bristol , connbased empire has accelerated an internal debate about williams even before this occurred , there were people who thought the opening was past its prime and were advocating a new one , he said others want to keep it for its tradition and legacy williams s remarks demonstrated the potency of hitler s name and how almost any comparison , except to another genocidal tyrant , is extreme mel brooks angered some people by his mockery of hitler and the nazis in the film and stage versions of several years ago , he explained his approach to satirizing hitler to the german publication der spiegel rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance he added that by using the medium of comedy , we can try to rob hitler of his posthumous power and myths espn has past experience none of it comedic with personnel who could not resist including hitler in their analyses in an online column , is like saying hitler was a victim , for which she was suspended she apologized on the air , lou holtz discussed michigan s tough start in 2008 and coach rich rodriguez s leadership ya know , hitler was a good leader , too \( you wonder when holtz the historian thought hitler s skills eroded \) unlike hill , holtz was not suspended , which suggested a double standard in those guys have all the fun , holtz defended himself by saying , i think the point i made was very valid , very solid , and it was a different angle than the way people look at it ron rosenbaum , the author of said that the tea party has legitimized the kind of casual comparison of obama to hitler we 've seen it at rallies with posters of obama with hitler mustaches and in the comments sections of rightwing news sites , he said i think that s what he s picking up on last year , the north iowa tea party put up a billboard with pictures of hitler and lenin flanking obama that said rosenbaum lamented that it s sort of sad that our political discourse has come to a point where we 're discussing hank williams on hitler he added , somehow , one hopes for more
cholesterollowering drugs called statins , which have been shown to lower a person s risk for heart attack , can also slightly increase a patient s risk for developing diabetes , particularly at higher doses , new research shows the findings , based on new analyses of five clinical trials involving 32 , 752 patients , raise new questions about how much we really know about the longterm effects of statins , which are the most widely prescribed drugs in the united states the focus on the link between statins and diabetes comes at a time when some medical experts and pharmaceutical companies have pushed to broaden the use of the drugs beyond the 40 million atrisk patients who already use them to healthy people who would take the drugs for prevention of heart disease doctors cautioned that patients should not overreact to the diabetes news , saying that the increased diabetes risk is very small , and that the benefits of statin therapy still far outweigh any side effects i do n't think it s very clinically important , said dr steven e nissen , chairman of cardiology at the cleveland clinic , who consults with drug companies that make statins but requires his fees be donated to charity what i worry about here is that people will read this story and say , 'i do n't want to get diabetes so i'm going to stop my statin , ' and then they have a heart attack last year , the medical journal the lancet published an analysis of major statin trials involving 90 , 000 patients that showed statin users had a 9 percent higher risk of developing diabetes than those who did n't take statins but questions remained about whether the effect was real or something that may have just been due to chance however , the latest analysis , published today in the journal of the american medical association , makes the strongest case yet that statins can trigger diabetes in some people the report focused on differences in diabetes risk among moderatedose and highdose statin users , and found that those taking high doses had a 12 percent higher risk of developing diabetes compared to moderatedose users that translates to a 20 percent overall increased risk of diabetes for highdose statin users , compared to those who do n't take the drugs , according to the study s senior author even so , medical experts , including the study authors , argued that while more study is needed to understand the diabetes link , the increased risk does n't eclipse the strong health gains achieved with statins , which in some studies have reduced heart attack and stroke risk by half based on the data in the study , a total of 498 people would need to take a statin before triggering one extra case of diabetes by comparison , just 155 people would need to take a statin to prevent one heart attack the net benefit favored the statins overall , said dr kausik ray , professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at st george s university of london and senior author on the paper dr ray says he has consulted for drug companies that make statins exactly how statins may increase diabetes risk is n't entirely clear , though animal studies suggest that statins can increase muscle resistance to insulin , resulting in higher levels of circulating blood sugar dr kausik notes that the patients in the studies were diagnosed with diabetes because of elevated blood sugar levels , but that the longterm consequences of higher blood sugar levels triggered by statin use are n't known diabetes is defined by blood glucose levels , but none of us are absolutely certain if this is going to carry the same risk as if you traditionally developed diabetes , dr kausik said in addition , dr nissen says the statins do n't cause blood sugar to shoot up rapidly but instead can slightly elevate blood sugar enough to push borderline patients across the threshold into diabetes it does n't take much to tip a few people over that boundary to the point where we call them diabetic , said dr nissen we ca n't dismiss it , but i also do n't want to scare people who need these drugs they are the best thing we 've got going to prevent coronary disease events this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
moscow every thursday , a bearded , bespectacled man arrives at the kremlin bearing a sheaf of data for vladislav y surkov , the government s chief ideologist there , a roomful of decision makers are gathered to hear the latest installment of what thinks as strange as it may sound to outsiders , the people who run russia are obsessed with approval ratings political competition has been all but extinguished since came to power , so elections serve as little more than a ritual display of loyalty but kremlin insiders see popularity as a key to the survival of a government that , 20 years after the soviet collapse , has few stable state institutions other than its leaders' personalities this accounts for a political life that sometimes looks like a neverending campaign , in which leaders extinguish wildfires , upbraid billionaire industrialists , or , as was seen last week , scuba dive in the company of a camera crew polling data has become an essential part of governing it will play a significant role in deciding who will become president next spring mr putin or the incumbent , and how the campaign will be waged mr putin has remained the dominant figure , even as he has gone from the presidency to the prime minister s office this system which has developed over 10 years is based on the support of the population , and that is a medical fact , said aleksandr a oslon , president of the public opinion foundation , who has delivered weekly briefings at the kremlin for 15 years in the last decade there were many disputes about this , but now there is no doubt the great support of the population is the essence of the existing social order this is the way the country is built mr oslon s company is one of several that conducts expensive , dataintensive polls on behalf of the kremlin and other government agencies , including an extensive georating , a regular survey of 60 , 000 russians , as well as a weekly poll of 3 , 000 which includes confidential questions shared only with mr medvedev s and mr putin s teams mr oslon s company seeks to spot dips in public opinion , or collapsing support for appointed regional leaders , before they develop into a serious problem for the kremlin polls are a channel for feedback , mr oslon said it s the same as in the world of finance if there is information that the dollar is falling , the central bank takes measures to stop that fall they start to buy up the dollar so that it increases it s the same in politics other pollsters seek to identify policy statements and political gestures that resonate with different segments of the russian public , like retirees with nostalgic notions of soviet power , or the educated urban middle class eager for indications that russia is becoming a modern nation they helped put together mr medvedev s most recent yearly address , which dropped his trademark issue of modernization in favor of child welfare and they help shape public appearances like mr medvedev s meticulous televised reminiscence of his role during russia s war with georgia , which gave his approval ratings a significant boost among the quandaries the russian government faces the putin majority that appeared a decade ago seems to be shrinking gradually , like a giant block of ice that is melting at the edges both mr putin and mr medvedev are entering the campaign cycle with approval ratings that though enviable by most international standards were lower this summer than at any point since 2008 , according to the stateowned allrussian public opinion center more striking is a slide in the popularity of united russia , the political party that mr putin leads to stop this drift , coming elections need to attract the real support of the population , said sergei a markov , a united russia deputy and kremlinconnected analyst colored revolutions happen if the leader is not popular , mr markov said he really must be popular one option is to reach back to the autocratic populism that became known as the putin phenomenon social science was part of that from early on one factor in mr putin s selection as president was a survey that showed that russians' mostadmired figures were fictional tough guys the undercover spy max otto von stirlitz and the homicide detective gleb zheglov , said igor v zadorin , who headed the kremlin s inhouse sociology department at the time mr putin s approval ratings climbed as he crushed resistance in chechnya , took control of opposition television stations and brought rebellious oligarchs to heel mr markov , an ardent advocate of mr putin s , makes the case that russia s passive majority will respond to a similar show of force this year , this time marshaled against drug dealers , criminality and moral decay though some , he noted , would prefer to take aim at american hegemony what is very much discussed is who should be the enemy of united russia and putin during this campaign , he said the opposite argument is coming from a liberal set of social scientists , who say the data shows the public is demanding a more open and competitive political model the economist mikhail e dmitriyev whose research group was originally founded to shape mr putin s economic platform began warning of a pretty abnormal spike in dissatisfaction he observed in political focus groups , first among middleclass muscovites and then appearing in other large cities he characterized the fundamental message with the russian phrase my ne bydlo , meaning , we are not cattle he said he rushed to release his data so that officials could avoid , say , disruptive outcomes and political confrontations that could run the whole system out of control it s really hard to imagine that an unpopular government which does not have a truly competitive political mandate can run this country smoothly , said mr dmitriyev , president of the center for strategic research it s not possible it might have been possible seven decades ago , when the whole system was based on violence and intimidation , but not today the kremlin s pollsters are not persuaded , though they , too , have documented growing dissatisfaction among urban elites the government has answers for this narrow but influential slice of the population , like mr medvedev s modernization drive , mr oslon said what is this dissatisfaction connected with \? it is connected with the fact that their ecology is not favorable , he said for them , the world is painted in negative colors but that world is not very big there is another big world , it has its own problems with summer in its last lazy stretch before the true beginning of campaign season , measures are clearly being taken to shore up the leaders' listless ratings last week a camera crew followed mr putin to the bottom of a bay in southern russia , where he was filmed in full scuba gear two amphoras , long jars with handles common in ancient greece and rome speaking to reporters afterward , mr putin that they dated from the sixth century ad , and that he had followed the instructions of archaeologists to locate the site it was about six feet below the surface aleksei a chesnakov , who was a key domestic political strategist throughout mr putin s presidency , said mr putin , mr medvedev and united russia had all lost support as the result of the prolonged uncertainty about which man will become president but he did not seem worried the ratings are about where they were in 2007 , he said approval ratings always wane toward the end of a presidential term , he said , and campaign techniques like television coverage can raise them by as much as 15 to 20 percentage points anything on screen affects the ratings , said mr chesnakov , a top official in united russia a leader who dives to the bottom of a bay , even if it is not very deep , he shows his health , his vigor watching it , you get an emotion , but it may take a week to develop , or a month , he said none of it , he added , should be taken as a sign that something is going wrong there are no frightened people in the kremlin , believe me , he said he dove into the bay not because his ratings are falling , but because there are elections coming
i m finding it hard to figure out what , exactly , republicans think about vegetables herman cain , who as we know always chooses his words with the greatest of care , called vegetable pizza sissy pizza on monday but house republicans are suggesting that pizza is itself a vegetable so does that mean all pizza is for sissies \? as ridiculous as the preceding paragraph sounds , believe me , it is no more so than the final version of a spending bill released late monday , which would nix usda school lunch standards proposed earlier in 2011 and let pizza count as a vegetable \( the sissy addendum is not in there \) the background is that federally subsidized lunches have to contain a certain number of vegetables but what , exactly , is a vegetable \? to make things extra confusing , the bill doesn t mention pizza but rather tomato paste it specifies that none of the funds made available by this act may be used to implement an interim final or final rule regarding nutrition programs that require the crediting of tomato paste and puree based on volume according to the ap , this nonsense means that two tablespoons of paste are sufficient for vegetablehood as long as lunch ladies bake two tablespoons of paste into their pizza , it s a vegetable i asked verlyn klinkenborg , who writes about agriculture and the environment for the editorial board , for his thoughts on the vegetal nature of pizza for me , the most interesting thing about this is how you turn language of the kind you find in the ag appropriations bill into pizza and vegetables on the face of it , it s almost impossible to tell what s being said but then , that s part of the point rather than revealing what the real subject is and who stands to lose or gain from it we re left with this truly indigestible wordstuff even ag experts \( meaning , roughly , me \) have a hard time moving from the text to the fact that this is really an industry move to feed school kids pizza the thinking seems to be that anything that has once been a vegetable remains a vegetable , no matter what form it ultimately takes and it has the unique property of turning anything it touches into a vegetable too no one in congress seems to realize that tomatoes are , in fact , fruits , but that s a separate issue
inventors , get your sneakers on the race to the patent office could soon be winnertakeall the senate voted monday evening to move to a final vote on a bill that would give priority on patents for new inventions to the first person to file an application at the united states patent office the current system gives priority to the person who can prove he was the first to invent something by a vote of 87 to 3 , the senate moved to end debate within 30 hours and complete a final vote on the bill , formally called the america invents act the measure , sponsored by senator patrick j leahy of vermont , would be the first significant change to the patent laws in 60 years this is the latest in a string of patent bills that have passed in either the senate or the house none have never made it to the president s desk for much of the last five years , the focus has been on changes to patent laws that would help to keep new patents from getting tied up in court those changes remain , but more recently , the focus has shifted to also include provisions that will provide better financing for the patent office , which pays for itself through the fees it assess on patent applicants the current bill , which would still have to pass the house before being sent for the president s signature , would allow the patent office to set its own fees david j kappos , the director of the patent office and undersecretary for intellectual property in the department of commerce , wants to install a new system that would allow applicants to pay a higher fee in order to guarantee that a decision on an application will be rendered within a year at the same time , he also wants to offer special , lower rates for small businesses and individual inventors currently , it takes about three years for the average patent application to make its way through the system , and the office has more than 700 , 000 applications that have not yet received even a first look mr kappos said that he needs additional revenues from patent fees to rebuild the office s technology systems , which he says are woefully out of date the patent bill has not proceeded without opposition , with some senators arguing that changing to a firsttofile system will benefit large companies , with their armies of patent lawyers , over small inventors who might not be able to get a proper application completed in time to be first to the patent office mr kappos said the change does not discriminate , but rather offers a more objective way to determine who should get priority he also notes that anyone can file an inexpensive provisional application , which essentially holds a spot at the head of the line until a full application can be readied
a closer look at week 9 , with the benefit of film analysis raiders o vs broncos d raider fans who are worried about their team s new franchise quarterback can actually feel optimistic carson palmer was , for the most part , impressive in this game his three interceptions were all explainable the first was a case of a superstar cornerback , champ bailey , dominating a callow wideout , denarius moore , in bumpandrun coverage on the second interception , moore tipped the ball over the middle \( the throw was a tad high \) the third pick was in garbage time in hurryup mode , with palmer being hit as he threw these were not like the palmer misreads that led to turnovers against the chiefs two weeks ago he showed poise , great pocket mobility and good touch there were minor chemistry issues with the receivers but keep in mind , moore is young and still learning jacoby ford \( who was excellent in the first half \) has missed some time , and tj houshmandzadeh is a newcomer \( who supplanted darrius heywardbey in the rotation but had trouble all afternoon getting separation \) oakland s run game was strong in the first half but tailed off after center samson satele s injury reshuffled the interior front line \( stefan wisniewski had been playing well at left guard but struggled after sliding over to center \) this , along with a flood of penalties , compromised the flow of the offense for the broncos , a few notes von miller was used as an inside blitzer , which proved to be a highly successful new wrinkle for this defense the box score says that elvis dumervil , with his first 15 sacks of the season , came out of his slumber he didn t the halfsack was produced by miller and the full sack was a classic coverage sack dumervil was , however , part of a broncos front seven that bogged down the run fairly well in the second half broncos o vs raiders d the raiders will kick themselves after watching this film their run defense was outstanding for much of the game but fell apart late they gave up two big runs to tim tebow and two to willis mcgahee on shotgun read options oakland s linebacking group seemed completely unprepared for the read option , which is inexcusable given denver s limited passing weapons it s surprising that the raiders did not shadow tebow the way the dolphins did his scrambles were differencemaking hard to fathom how a defense can be illprepared for tebow s runs daryl blackstock , starting for injured middle linebacker rolando mcclain , was particularly bad he was easily manipulated by the offense s tactical deceits and lacked the speed to get outside or recover from his mistakes the broncos coaching staff did a great job of building a protebow game plan and he responded tebow ran well , protected the football and , on three occasions , properly executed a throw that made the raiders pay for mistakes in man coverage whether this sort of plan can work week to week remains to be seen redskins o vs 49ers d the respective approaches seemed to suggest that both teams realized that the injuryriddled redskins did not have enough firepower to outgun a staunch niners defense the redskins did not even attempt to push the ball downfield \( though john beck , who seemed to play a tad hurriedly , did pass up a few open opportunities to do so \) they also abandoned their run game after falling behind by two scores \( they maybe would have abandoned it anyway considering their oline could not get movement against nose tackle isaac sopoaga company \) the niners were equally conservative they blitzed sparingly and dared the skins to defeat basic 34 defensive zones a great illustration of washington s aerial limitations was the fact that running back roy helu set a franchise record with 14 receptions helu is far from an accomplished receiving back niners inside linebackers patrick willis and navorro bowman both stood out , as usual they re the first and secondbest 34 inside linebackers in the nfc \( the hard part is determining who is 1 and who is 1a \) 49ers o vs redskins d the niners are still using the same high schoolstyle offense that they were criticized for in our earlier film reviews this season yours truly asserted that it was not a sustainable winning formula obviously , yours truly has been proved wrong sunday s game at washington was the epitome of effective ballcontrol offense alex smith managed the game extremely well he was not able to push the ball downfield save for a 30yard touchdown to fullback bruce miller on a wheel route that linebacker rocky mcintosh incorrectly guessed would be a curl in the flats in large part because the niners sent only three receivers on routes and kept extra guys in to pass protect when the throws weren t there and they often weren t smith bought himself a little time and threw the ball away in san francisco , this is considered good quarterbacking the niners can afford to play this way because they have a great defense and meatandpotatoes run game they showcased an array of different runplay alignments and motions out of 22 personnel \( two backs , two tight ends \) they knew the redskins would be a tough defense to run against , so they manufactured yards through creative design smart coaching , sound execution that s the 2011 niners in a nutshell texans o vs browns d this was one where you watched two series and wondered why you decided to break down this game the stats book told the story houston rushed for an easy 261 yards their offensive line had no trouble moving cleveland s front four off the ball right guard mike brisiel looked like an allpro in the first half , and center chris myers won battle after battle inside as a defender , if you can t hold your ground and force myers to play in a phone booth , you ll fall victim to his shrewd ability to create angles on lateral movement in the run game he s tailormade for a zone scheme the browns should be concerned about their linebacking corps and really concerned about their pass rush when jabaal sheard gets neutralized \( as he was all afternoon \) , there s absolutely no pressure on the quarterback another concern is the firstround rookie defensive tackle phil taylor he has not shown up on film all season despite frequently facing blockers oneonone browns o vs texans d this game was essentially over as soon as houston scored its second touchdown no team is less equipped to play from behind than cleveland their quarterback lacks toplevel arm strength , their receivers speed is bankrupt and the offensive line s lack of athleticism at left guard and on the right side becomes problematic when opposing pass rushers tee off this is what happened sunday in the first half , texans backup defensive linemen earl mitchell and tim jamison stood out in the way they got off blocks in the second half , outside linebackers connor barwin and brooks reed \( especially reed \) took over they re a fast , energetic duo no games are easy supposed to be easy in the nfl , but this one was titans o vs bengals d \( time did not permit review of titans d vs bengals o \) after a very solid first half , the titans were taken out of rhythm and frustrated throughout the last 30 minutes the bengals defensive line , led by domata peko as he defeated oneonone blocking in the middle , stonewalled the titans offensive line and kept chris johnson bottled up johnson had looked like his old self in the first half , turning the corner outside , juking defenders in the open field and eating up yards with relatively quick acceleration the bengals blitzed infrequently , played a lot of traditional coverage and dared the titans receiving targets to beat them at face value , tennessee does not have a good downfield pass game none of the wideouts have the proper combination of speed and route running polish , and matt hasselbeck is not a great precision passer beyond the underneath intermediate levels they ve been able to manufacture a few big plays thanks to creative route combinations drawn up by offensive coordinator chris palmer , but those can only take you so far in the end , it s about having the players the setting was favorable for tennessee , as cincy s pass rush was quiet until the fourth quarter cowboys o vs seahawks d demarco murray looks like the real deal he has a subtle suddenness to his game and can quickly drum up forceful downhill momentum when he hits the accelerator he s a true north south runner with some faint hints of eastwest mobility for the second time in three weeks , murray benefited from excellent blocking left guard montrae holland stood out on a few pull blocks , and throughout the game , all of the dallas linemen were able to successfully make contact with seattle s second level defenders tackles doug free and tyron smith rendered seattle s pass rushers , including chris clemons , irrelevant seahawks corners richard sherman and brandon browner did a solid job in press coverage , but tony romo made just enough big plays through the air it was not a great game for seattle s safeties seahawks o vs cowboys d it has been the same issue week in and week out with this offense an inability to mount sustainable drives through the air the cowboys , with their incredibly wideranging assortment of personnel packages and presnap looks , made tarvaris jackson think too much jackson likes to see the receiver get open in order to pull the trigger he doesn t anticipate throwing windows well normally that leads to sacks but in this one , seattle s front five did a good job so jackson s progressions instead led to more incompletions the one time the cowboys did blitz and pressure jackson , he underthrew a blanketed sidney rice , resulting in an interception the cowboys shouldn t feel completely content with their performance their defensive line did not quite make enough big plays , and their inside linebackers , playing without sean lee , looked out of place a few times in coverage and were consistently handled in the run game andy benoit is and founder of nfltouchdowncom he can be reached at andybenoit nfltouchdowncom or
david brooks gail , i know you re busy with a book deadline on top of everything else , so i will try not to impose any heavy lifting my simple question is this if the greeks end up rejecting the eu bailout offer , how should the french and german banks restructure their amortization schedules \? don t worry , i m kidding i m not even sure i know what amortization means , except that it derives from the french word amour , meaning love , and the german word , tization , which means one who has an erotic relationship with other people s credit reports my real subject today is herman cain gail collins i vote we go back to the eu david brooks let s start with the politics of it my first question is over whether the clinton statute of limitations has expired my assumption , post lewinsky scandal , was that for at least a decade no president or presidential candidate could be punished for an improper workplace relationship because if clinton could get away with it then no one else should suffer \( this excludes cases involving congressional pages , public bathrooms and barechested pictures delivered by email \) gail collins david , i am so pleased you brought this up because i once wrote a book about political scandals , most of which were about sex i now know quite a bit more about alexander hamilton s love life than i might have preferred anyhow , my conclusion was that american voters have a very transactional relationship with politicians they don t really care deep down about their moral behavior , as long as they can deliver of course , what they want this politician to deliver might be a social conservative agenda , but even then , private behavior doesn t make as much difference as you might think david brooks do you think cain can be excluded from the presidency based on what we know so far , given the clinton standard \? my impression , for what it s worth is that no , he can t even if everything that is alleged is true , this is less egregious than clinton gail collins go back to the congressmen with the barechested cellphone pictures or the lewd tweets why did they have to go away \? because the one thing voters will not abide is behavior that suggests the pol in question is a whack job david brooks my next observation concerns republican psychology the allegations have caused many republicans to rally around cain on liberal media hightech lynching grounds opposition to politico seems to arouse stronger passions among republican primary voters than any violation of a gentlemanly code of behavior i do think people who care about the general moral atmosphere should pause when allegations are made , even about people on their own political team gail collins i have to say that the line about liberals being terrified of a strong conservative black man is peculiar even for ann coulter we can only handle strong black men if they re in favor of capandtrade \? david brooks now we turn to ethical issues my first question , and this is a genuine question , concerns the victims let s detach ourselves from the specifics of the cain case and consider a general question if you are the victim of sexual harassment , and you agree to remain silent in exchange for a fivefigure payoff , should any moral taint attach to you \? in the old days , somebody who allowed a predator to continue his hunting in exchange for money would certainly be considered a sinner i m reluctant to judge people in these circumstances , but i m inclined to agree am i missing something \? gail collins sexual harassment is a matter so serious that i m not prepared to prejudge anybody , including the woman who accepted money in return for leaving the organization , until i have a pretty fair factual understanding of what actually happened if you feel you have no power , that everybody with clout is aligned against you , and the situation makes keeping your job untenable , you might feel compelled to just get out of there with whatever compensation is available to tide you over on the other side , if none of cain s accusers speak up in public , it s hard to judge him guilty however , if cain has an episode involving charges like that in his background , voters have a right to expect that before he ran for president of the united states he would have figured out how to explain his side of the story if it came up coherently explain without totally contradicting himself david brooks finally we turn to what cain is alleged to have done where is the harassment line these days \? if an employer asks a woman to come to his hotel room and she says no and he lets the matter drop , is that harassment \? i confess i m not sure i ve worked at places where people who worked together had romantic relationships i presume those relationships started with one person making an overture is it harassment if the overture is rejected but not harassment if the overture is accepted or is any overture between people at the same firm harassment on its face \? again , i m not saying this is proper behavior , i m just wondering if it s harassment gail collins if an employer asks someone he supervises to come to his hotel room that is probably harassment and most definitely a bad way to run a business there s a difference between coworkers having a romantic relationship and being propositioned by your boss david brooks then there are other vaguely described infractions cain is alleged to have made physical gestures that were not overtly sexual these made people uncomfortable don t know what to think of that is someone else s discomfort automatically a sign that something egregious is going on \? gail collins cain is alleged by cain to have made physical gestures that were not overtly sexual does he strike you as the most selfaware guy on the planet \? i think if you re respectful of the people around you , you are not going to have a problem just the other day i was talking with somebody whose boss asked a female underling at a company party if she was going to do a lap dance he probably thought this was hilarious but i guarantee you , this is not comfortcreating humor you know , back in the anita hill days i remember guys in some of the nation s newsrooms being shocked about the new rules for workplace behavior how could you have a normal collegial relationship among journalists if you had to watch every word \? if you couldn t make jokes about women s breasts or whether somebody was in a bad mood because she was having her period \? and then , when it became a matter of legal consequences , somehow most of those very same people managed to clean up their acts and get along perfectly well david brooks my own guess is that this specific sort of behavior is insensitive , creepy and , given that cain is married , sinful but is it disqualifying for someone trying to run for public office \? if i began this week firmly believing that herman cain would make a great president , should i end the week thinking the man is simply not fit \? gail collins i never bought into the electtheguyyouwanttohaveabeerwith theory of voting , but i don t think i m prepared to go as far as whocaresifhecreepsmeout and david , if you began the week believing that herman cain would make a great president , we would have much larger matters to discuss
a lot of political analysis focuses in nearobsessive detail on demographic groups the strategy , for example , that mark penn outlined for hillary clinton before the 2008 democratic primaries identified 25 distinct swing demographic categories , including such relatively narrow ones as women aged 35 to 49 and single men demographics , certainly , are a part of the picture and they are something that we discuss around here on occasion but with one clear exception , the impact that demographics have on voting behavior is a lot more fluid than you might think from all the talk of soccer moms and nascar dads on saturday , for instance , we noted that membership in a labor union increased the likelihood that a person voted for barack obama by about 12 percentage points is that meaningful \? sure elections take place on the margins viewed another way , though , it doesn t really tell you all that much if you think that being in a union determines 12 percent of someone s vote , that means that other factors determine 88 percent of it the truth is that none of us is just one thing we are all members of any number of different demographic categories and the voting tendencies associated with those categories often point in different , or even conflicting , directions for instance , i am a nonunionized white male who makes an aboveaverage income , all things that predict republican voting but i m also collegeeducated , relatively young , and live in the urban northeast , all things that predict democratic voting to the extent that my political interests are dictated by my demographics , i have a lot of competing priorities one way we can generalize this idea is to return to the data set that we used on saturday the national annenberg election survey and create a personalized probability profile \( sorry if i sound like an eharmony commercial \) for each of the roughly 15 , 000 respondents in the survey so , for instance , we can estimate the likelihood that a married asianamerican woman living in a milwaukee suburb , or a childless , churchgoing military veteran living in boise , would vote for barack obama or john mccain , based on their responses to the poll then we can combine these individual estimates into a probability distribution to see what the country as a whole looks like for most of the country , the prediction falls somewhere in the middle of the scale about 52 percent of the people in the model , based on their demographics , had no less than a oneinthree chance , but no more than a twointhree chance , of voting for barack obama for only 19 percent of voters could the voting preference be predicted with at least 80 percent certainty by demographics if you looked at political variables for each respondent , as well as demographics , you could improve on those projections quite a bit if you knew , for instance , that someone was a democrat , you d know that they were very probably going to vote for mr obama but how do you know if someone is a democrat \? based on their demographics alone , you usually wouldn t have more than a fuzzy idea unless , of course , that person happens to be africanamerican you may have noticed that the chart above contains two distinct peaks there s a big glut of people who are somewhere around 50percent likely to vote for mr obama as you would expect but then there is a smaller but still easily discerned cluster of people who are about 90 percent likely to be in the obama column this smaller group is made up almost entirely of africanamericans as i mentioned on saturday , even if every other demographic characteristic was favorable to the republicans say , for instance , that a voter was 72 , wealthy , extremely religious and a veteran who lived in the rural south he was nevertheless at least 80 percent likely to vote for mr obama if the voter was also black \( for many other africanamericans , the probability approached 100 percent \) some of this , of course , is because mr obama himself is black but the phenomenon of overwhelming black preference for democratic presidential candidates is not new even george mcgovern got 82 percent of the black vote in 1972 still , it is very much the exception if we look at the same data for hispanic voters , for instance , we see that although they re generally more inclined to vote democratic , there is a much wider spread of probabilities some hispanic people , based on their other demographic characteristics , were nearlocks to vote for mr obama , but others were more likely to vote republican a candidate would do herself few favors either writing off the hispanic vote or taking it for granted many latinos are swing voters , and they care about many issues besides immigration meanwhile , the pattern for voters who describe themselves as evangelical christians is quite interesting while this is obviously a republicanleaning group overall , that doesn t guarantee anything only about 3 in 10 evangelicals could be considered at least 75 percent likely to have voted for john mccain , according to the model this group contains its share of swing voters , and there are a sizable number of black evangelical christians , who were very likely to vote for barack obama finally , here is the chart for voters who were members of a labor union or who lived in a household with someone else who was while being in a union is a statistically significant predictor of democratic voting , this characteristic competes with , and is often outweighed by , any number of other factors that means that , on the one hand , there is significant risk for republicans in alienating union members a lot of them are the very epitome of swing voters on the other hand , it means that while democrats are likely to do fairly well with union voters , those votes are far from certain a union man is a union man , and also a lot of other things he may be a father and a veteran and hispanic and a churchgoing catholic and a resident of denver and all of those things will tug in different ways on the choice he will get to make as a voter
following up on my review last week of via verde , a groundbreaking green housing project soon to be completed in the melrose section of the south bronx , i took a walk around that neighborhood with amanda m burden , director the department of city planning under mayor michael r bloomberg we shot some video of our tour please watch it by clicking here  via verde aside , nearly a dozen public housing complexes have been built in melrose during the last decade , as part of the mayor s 85 billion initiative to preserve and add some 165 , 000 subsidized apartments around the city it seemed like a good idea to make the video to give times readers a look at a few of the buildings and some sense of the scope of the change that has come to the south bronx none of the citysponsored housing developments is as architecturally ambitious as via verde , a publicprivate initiative , and they are not as meticulously built , but they are examples of the latest thinking about what subsidized housing should look like in this neighborhood the idea is to increase urban density , with largescale apartment buildings modeled after what you might call traditional brickfaced new york city apartment houses so there are retail spaces on the ground floor and trees along the sidewalks and the best of the places roughly mimic an old upper west side building st ann s , just around the corner from via verde , is a prime example occupying an entire city block , the facade is varied to make it appear as if there were several buildings instead of one giant one , and to bring the appearance of the scale down to something a little less overwhelming we didn t show in the video enough of the single family , brownstonestyle housing that has also restored a little stoop life to various blocks , along with homeownership the latest census shows that people have been moving back to the south bronx in big numbers it s a still a poor neighborhood housing isn t the same as jobs , after all , but as ms burden remarks in the video , one is dependent on the other and in the end , because all parts of the the city are interdependent , the entire city benefits when this area improves we re still figuring out the best way to open up a forum for discussion of architecture and urbanism , but meanwhile we re welcoming comments and hoping you ll follow me on twitter kimmelman  an earlier version of this post misstated the amount of money dedicated to the initiative to preserve and add subsidized housing
there are 101 ncaa trophies sitting in the stanford athletic hall of fame room , none of them for women s soccer that is something that the cardinal \( 2401 \) are looking to change in its fourth consecutive trip to the final four now the team is just one win away from its first college cup after a 30 victory over florida state \( 1871 \) in kennesaw , ga , on friday night stanford s first two goals were sparked by forward chioma ubogagu , a freshman who has struggled at times in her first ncaa tournament florida state controlled much of the action and generated several scoring chances , but stanford s execution in the final third sent it to the sunday final for the third straight season they like to play our kind of soccer , which is great because that s the way the game should be played , ubogagu said at the end of the day , it s all about what you do with your possession and your chances maybe we weren t possessing it as much as against past teams , but when we had opportunities , we put them away emily oliver was brilliant between the posts for the cardinal , turning away all four seminoles corners and fending off six shots on goal florida state came out strong , forcing a closerange save by oliver in the 16th minute and taking advantage of poor passing from the cardinal to control play early on stanford s opening tally ended the push by the seminoles a 21stminute corner by florida state defender tiana brockway was headed straight to ubogagu , who raced upfield and forced mccarty to slip at the center line after a giveandgo with midfielder teresa noyola , ubogagu made another defender lose her footing with some fancy dribbling in the box and sneaked a shot through the legs of goaltender kelsey wys to open the scoring at 21 18 assistant coach jay cooney pulled me aside and told me that defending on corners , they send a lot of people up , ubogagu said i had a lot of space , and teresa made a great run just two minutes later , ubogagu took a pass from lindsay taylor and made a strong run down the left side barely outracing a florida state defender , ubogagu found enough space to slip a pass to a sliding kristy zurmuhlen , whose pinpoint redirection to the near post gave the cardinal a twogoal lead chi was awesome tonight , oliver said it s not easy as a freshman to come in on a big stage , but i think she did great tonight she was her normal self she was just taking people on and making things happen the shellshocked seminoles eventually responded to threaten several times late in the half , but failed to take advantage of a series of opportunities frustrated most of all was their star forward tiffany mccarty a 18goalscorer , she left the field in the final minute of the opening half , blood pouring from her nose , only seconds after missing an open look just over the crossbar , her only shot of the match oliver kept stanford ahead with a pair of fingertip saves in a 46second span early in the second half , tipping a brockway free kick over the crossbar before diving to her left for another lastsecond stop on the ensuing corner emily is an incredible keeper i can speak for the team in saying that we feel so confident and comfortable having her in the back of the goal , ubogagu said there were some exchanges that could have been gamechangers , but she helped us settle down and pick up right where we left off and for the second time friday night , the cardinal responded in front of the sophomore goalkeeper s heroics defender madeline thompson collected a stray corner kick near midfield and fed a ball into the box for alina garciamendez a defender for the mexican world cup squad last summer alongside noyola who beat out two seminoles to head in her first goal of the season the 64thminute tally ended any hope of a comeback for possessionoriented florida state , whose season was ended by the cardinal in a 50 quarterfinal rout a year ago stanford now advances to play the winner of dukewake forest in the college cup final at 1 pm sunday , hoping that it can win the national title after losing by 10 in the final in both 2009 and 2010 at this point , we have so much experience here in these big games that it s just a matter of taking care of business , oliver said i think our nerves are under control , we ve been here a number of times and we ve done a good job of giving the freshmen that have not been here an idea of what it s going to be like we re all ready to go , we just can t wait for sunday joseph beyda is a sports desk editor for the stanford daily , the independent student daily at stanford university
in the eyes of lisa thomas , the needs of the 15th ward are so extensive it is difficult to list them all things have been going downhill , said ms thomas , a mother of four and a 12year resident of the south side ward we need new homes and better schools we need rebuilding with unemployment stubbornly high and city hall grappling with annual budget deficits , economic development has been the leading issue in ward races across chicago candidates have debated the best ways to lure businesses , fill empty storefronts , improve infrastructure , halt an epidemic of foreclosures and create jobs perhaps no other community has as many pressing challenges and so little political clout to use in addressing them as the 15th ward the ward is shaped like a and includes large chunks of the historically workingclass neighborhoods of west englewood and chicago lawn its irregular borders and a history of lackluster aldermen , low voter participation and disinvestment have left it without the political power that could have turned things around alderman toni foulkes , a former cake decorator elected to a first term with heavy union support , says she has made progress and needs more time her seven opponents six on the ballot and one mounting a writein campaign say the ward has continued to slide and cannot afford another four years of weak representation over the last decade , the ward lost 6 percent of its population , including nearly half of its white residents , and household income fell in most of the ward s census tracts , according to census estimates the ward is now about 65 percent black , 30 percent hispanic and 4 percent white , though almost all of the hispanics and whites live in the western chicago lawn part of the ward more than 2 , 500 properties there have gone into foreclosure since 2007 , one of the highest totals in the city , according to researchers at the nonprofit some blocks have several boardedup homes on each side of the street while crime has fallen citywide , it has been resilient in the two police districts that include the 15th ward , where burglaries are up 20 percent and homicides 31 percent since 2006 the city s chief economic development initiative , the tax increment financing program , has barely touched the area the ward ranked 49th out of 50 in tif spending from 2004 to 2008 , trailed only by the northwest side s 41st ward , whose longtime alderman refused to participate in the program knowing it is not the poorest or most blighted part of chicago provides little solace to longtime residents it s gotten way worse , said edgar gonzalez , a laidoff truck driver who on a recent afternoon was mopping the floor of the one stop shop , a small food store on 63rd street where he now works people on my block are leaving alderman foulkes , 46 , said she knew all too well that the ward had serious problems she still lives in the home near 65th and paulina where she grew up in the 1970s she recalled that when she was younger , 63rd street had an ice cream parlor , record stores , restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance it was a great place to grow up , she said in the summer we would sit on the porch until late at night in the time since , she said , capital flight , joblessness and high crime have devastated the area i 've watched it happen over 39 years , she said i know you ca n't fix it all in 4 the ward does not have a history of strong representation from 1991 to 1999 , its alderman was virgil jones , a former police officer nicknamed lock 'em up jones , whose political career ended in a conviction for taking bribes he was followed by theodore thomas , whose reticence in the city council earned him the nickname silent ted four years ago , after mr thomas announced his retirement , 11 candidates vied for the seat when none received the 50 percent required to win , the top two , ms foulkes and felicia simmonsstovall , a lawyer for the state of illinois , advanced to a runoff in a ward with little established political power , it was no coincidence that both had outside support unions contributed more than 500 , 000 to ms foulkes ms simmonsstovall had the backing of the illinois secretary of state , jesse white , and his prot g , alderman walter burnett of the 27th ward ms foulkes won with 60 percent of the 4 , 641 votes cast , the lowest total of any of the 12 runoff elections that year ms foulkes has been a quiet , moderate presence in the city council , voting for most of mayor richard m daley s initiatives , including annual budgets and the parking meter lease deal , but joining with progressive colleagues to push for more affordable housing in an interview in her office , ms foulkes said she had made steady progress in cleaning up the ward and upgrading infrastructure she jumped out of her chair and pointed at a map on the wall marked in different colors that she said showed where improvements had been made with city , state and federal money i 've been digging up money from everywhere i can find , she said i put in new street lighting here , and sidewalks here , and fixed a railroad viaduct here , and here the street was down to cobblestones before we repaved it but the alderman s seven opponents have seized on residents' frustrations over economic stagnation and crime at a recent candidates' forum that ms foulkes did not attend , challengers took turns criticizing her as not being aggressive enough in confronting the area s problems michael finney , an activist mounting a writein campaign , noted that the ward did not have a major grocery store sammy pack jr , an iraq war veteran , deplored the prevalence of liquor stores and fastfood restaurants , saying the alderman should be fighting to bring businesses like jamba juice to the ward and ms simmonsstovall said , if elected , she would find a way to harness the area s buying power , perhaps after soliciting help from michelle obama why should n't we have a borders or a crate barrel in this community \? she said campaign contributions can be tough to come by in the 15th ward , and ms simmonsstovall has yet to report any fundraising for this election neither have three of the other challengers this year secretary of state white and alderman burnett are staying out of the race ms simmonsstovall said that she had been reluctant to run again but that she felt she had to because ms foulkes had not done enough , starting with leveraging help from city hall a closed mouth does n't get fed , she said ms foulkes continues to enjoy the support of progressive labor unions she s been a good vote and a good voice on the city council , said tom balanoff , president of the illinois state council of the service employees international union the problem nowadays is that in a lot of wards there are lots of issues and there s not enough money to deal with all of them all of her challengers accused ms foulkes of being distracted by citywide issues mr pack said ms foulkes should be working harder to lower crime to make the area attractive to businesses , while syron smith , a block club activist , said she should be organizing residents ms foulkes dismissed the criticism my opponents know i'm doing a good job , she said they just need a job themselves
gov andrew m cuomo will hold a confidential strategy session with leading gay activists on wednesday to discuss how to legalize samesex marriage in new york , the latest sign that he is preparing to put the weight of his administration behind legislation that has divided lawmakers and voters across the country aides to mr cuomo have invited about a dozen of the state s prominent samesexmarriage advocates to the capitol for the brainstorming session , according to people told of the meeting , which the governor himself will attend mr cuomo s participation , which was confirmed on tuesday by his spokesman , josh vlasto , is viewed as the strongest evidence yet of his commitment to passing samesex marriage this year , despite its rejection by the legislature in 2009 by most accounts , the task will not be easy , even for the highly popular democratic governor , whose wide margin of electoral victory and long history in albany has given him unusual influence within the slowmoving culture of the capital when the legislature was controlled by democrats two years ago , a bill to legalize gay marriage was defeated in the senate by a 38to24 vote , with eight democrats opposing the measure now , the republicans control the senate by a narrow margin samesex marriage advocates say the governor needs to win over at least six members of the senate and , most likely , a few republicans , none of whom backed the bill in 2009 as part of this effort , mr cuomo and his aides are working on assembling an effective coalition of gay activists who , despite a shared agenda , have not always coordinated well together even so , mr cuomo may introduce a bill to make samesex marriage legal in new york by june , people familiar with his thinking said the republican senate leader , dean g skelos of long island , has said he will allow a vote whether a republican will support it remains an open question on wednesday , during the strategy session , the governor will meet with christine c quinn , the speaker of the city council , who is openly gay brian ellner , who is pushing for samesex marriage in new york for the human rights campaign , a national advocacy group ross d levi , the head of the state s leading gay rights organization , the empire state pride agenda and richard socarides , a former clinton administration official and president of equality matters , a new advocacy group lawmakers who have sponsored the marriage legislation in the past , like assemblyman daniel o 'donnell and senator tom duane , are expected to attend as well , according to those told of the meeting the attendees either declined to comment or could not be reached mr vlasto declined to comment on who will be at the meeting this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
postmortems can be painful , particularly for a team like the jets , who talked loudly and proudly about what they hoped to do this season in looking back on sunday s loss in pittsburgh , the jets can replay any number of decisions they made during the game but at least three stand out perhaps the jets' most illfated decision on sunday was the first one they made it took place before the game started , at midfield , when the jets won the coin toss and elected to defer their choice to the second half such a strategy is nothing new for the jets in fact , coach would prefer to defer in this situation 99 times out of 100 but in this instance , the decision backfired the steelers' offense took the opening kickoff and held the ball for nearly twothirds of the first quarter pittsburgh ran 15 plays on its opening drive , and none gained more than 12 yards , a slow , steady , methodical march that ended with a touchdown after 9 minutes 6 seconds had elapsed while pittsburgh plodded down the field , the jets' offense spent nearly half an hour of real time on the sideline , in freezing temperatures , jogging to stay warm quarterback mark sanchez , a native of southern california who has struggled in cold weather , managed to put together a brief drive when he finally got on the field , but it ended in a punt by then , the steelers had set the tone of the first half , which ended , 243 , in their favor the jets' offense struggled throughout this season early in games , so much so that ryan ditched his favored gameopening strategy in december against miami when the jets won the coin toss at home against the dolphins , ryan elected to receive at that point in the season , his offense had scored all of 26 firstquarter points but the reversal , which sanchez called a cool changeup at the time , did not spark the offense to a faster start in any case , ryan did not secondguess his decision to defer after sunday s game was over he said that he would do the same thing each time the jets win a coin toss next season down , 2410 , with 8 39 remaining on sunday , the jets stood 2 yards from the end zone and a onescore game they ran four plays two incomplete passes sandwiched between two runs up the middle and gained only 1 yard the sequence of calls seems curious in hindsight the jets pride themselves on a groundandpound offensive philosophy , and yet running back shonn greene , their designated battering ram , carried the ball only one time in those four plays , on first down , for one yard afterward , quarterback mark sanchez said the jets struggled with communication problems during that series because of issues with his headset on second down , he had to run to the sideline to receive the call as the play clock ticked toward zero , the jets chose to rush their play rather than call a timeout and get organized sanchez s pass to dustin keller then fell incomplete on fourth down , fullback tony richardson said , the jets called for a play that has been our staple all year long but instead of greene , they sent running back ladainian tomlinson into a wall of black and gold when tomlinson tried to extend the ball over a crush of steelers , he could not lift it i tried to fight as hard as i could , tomlinson said it s tough afterward , ryan defended the jets' sequence of plays and , by extension , his offensive coordinator , brian schottenheimer , who is often secondguessed we do n't design plays to fail , ryan said on the steelers' ensuing possession , the jets registered a safety when pittsburgh botched the snap exchange and the jets then scored a touchdown to draw within 5 points still , the failure at the goal line wo n't be easy to forget when sanchez and jerricho cotchery connected for a touchdown with 3 09 remaining , the jets faced a problem they trailed , 2419 , but had all three timeouts and the twominute warning they had to decide whether to send the kickoff deep , placing pressure on their defense to get the ball back , or gamble with an onside kick ryan said he never wavered nick folk sailed the kickoff deep , and antonio brown returned it 27 yards , which gave pittsburgh the ball at the 41yard line not far from where they would have recovered an onside kick in choosing to kick deep , ryan played the percentage most nfl coaches would play , but he also placed enormous faith in his defense , which struggled to stop pittsburgh in all eight quarters the teams played this season the jets knew that two more first downs by the steelers would end their season the first came when pittsburgh gambled on second down , and quarterback ben roethlisberger threaded a pass to tight end heath miller for a 14yard gain the jets used their second timeout after that play , their third and final timeout after the next , and after the twominute warning , pittsburgh faced a critical thirdand6 ryan expected a quarterback draw , and pittsburgh lined up in an empty backfield when roethlisberger went to pass instead , the jets had the optimal situation because an incompletion would have stopped the clock and given them the ball but roethlisberger escaped pressure and found brown for a 14yard completion as heinz field erupted in celebration throughout this season , the jets' defense made critical stops late in games to give the offense the ball but not on sunday , when the jets' offense never made it back onto the field that s the first time in that situation our defense has n't responded and gotten the big stop , ryan said  the jets have a lot of things to think about now that their offseason has begun two weeks before the super bowl , instead of right after it these are three of their top concerns the jets will enter next season with a solid foundation they possess three of the most important pieces of any football team a respected head coach \( ryan \) , a franchise quarterback \( sanchez \) and a shutdown cornerback \( darrelle revis \) they also signed two key cogs of their offensive line d'brickashaw ferguson and nick mangold to contract extensions but the jets also went into this season with several key players signed to oneyear deals , and , as a result , now face a series of complicated decisions further clouded by labor uncertainty and potential retirements this happens every season to every nfl team , of course , but the jets face more uncertainty than usual as a result of their winnow choices last spring the jets have 17 free agents , and their most irreplaceable include linebacker david harris , cornerback antonio cromartie and three wide receivers santonio holmes , braylon edwards and brad smith it is almost certain some of those players will not return general manager mike tannenbaum must also decide what to do about a host of aging veterans , including fullback tony richardson , the passrush specialist jason taylor , running back ladainian tomlinson and defensive lineman trevor pryce each could also elect to retire , or be pushed in that direction by the jets taylor in particular sounded unsure of his future after the jets' loss on sunday harris , the only member of the jets' socalled big four revis , mangold and ferguson are the other three to not receive an extension before this season , figures to be the top priority smith , who returns kicks and covers them and runs the jets' wildcattype package on offense , would be difficult to replace with one player beyond that , the jets must decide whether to keep holmes , their most electrifying receiver , or edwards , their most consistent one , or both they must decide whether to retain cromartie , who was solid , if inconsistent this season , but who has no clear replacement on the current roster they must also decide how to get younger on defense , especially in the front seven , where five of the seven starters are 30 years of age or older the good news \? at least they have the franchise tag while the jets captured two of their three games against new england this season , including a playoff victory for the ages this month , the patriots won the division crown again with 14 victories in the regular season new england also holds six picks in the first three rounds of next april s nfl draft for a team with few holes to begin with , the patriots now have the flexibility to add depth the jets , meanwhile , have several needs , but only two picks in the first three rounds with which to address them ryan adds cornerbacks each season as if he is a collector and with cromartie a free agent , ryan is likely to look for help there , especially after the jets' firstround pick last season , cornerback kyle wilson , struggled beyond cornerback , the jets must address needs at defensive line , where shaun ellis , trevor pryce and kris jenkins are all over 30 at inside linebacker , where bart scott will enter his 10th season and where the depth is thin and on the offensive line , which could also use more depth if quarterback mark brunell retires , the jets will decide if kellen clemens is capable of being the primary backup all of that said , the core of the jets remains solid but dethroning the patriots will still be a difficult task do n't bet on it as ryan addressed the news media late sunday night , he alternated between despondent and defiant our goal next year , i 've got news for you , it wo n't change , he said , his voice rising it will never change we 're going to chase that we 're going to chase it until we get it then , we 'll chase it after that again ryan continued but that s it if you want to criticize us , then go ahead , but you have no right ryan set the tone for this franchise at his first news conference , when he declared the jets would win the super bowl , not in the future , but immediately he has not stopped talking neither his main goal , nor his approach , ever wavered the question is whether this will eventually wear thin , whether the jets will tire of the targets that ryan enlarges on their backs through his words and actions , whether ryan can withstand the inevitable criticism his approach would receive during an unsuccessful season ryan seems to care not one iota about such concerns he took that same approach in baltimore , where his defenses ranked among the league s best each season he has taken that same approach in two seasons with the jets he will take that same approach next season and beyond this is not necessarily a bad thing free agents around the league have spoken openly about their desire to play for ryan so have the jets who will enter free agency this season
seokyong lee bloomberg newsrajat gupta8 47 pm updated the securities and exchange commission has accused a former director of goldman sachs and procter gamble of passing illegal tips about those companies to raj rajaratnam , the galleon group founder who is to go on trial next week on insider trading charges the former director , rajat k gupta , is accused of passing along information on the two companies' earnings as well as word of warren e buffett s 5 billion investment in goldman sachs in 2008 as a longtime senior executive at mckinsey company , mr gupta , 62 , is the most prominent business executive ensnared by the government in a wideranging investigation into insider trading on wall street he ran mckinsey from 1994 to 2003 and counts as friends and associates some of the most powerful people in business in comparison , many of the defendants charged earlier with insider trading were junior traders and lawyers or midlevel executives over the last 18 months , federal prosecutors in manhattan have charged 46 people with insider trading of those , 29 have pleaded guilty but the sec s civil case against mr gupta reaches into the most elite boardrooms of corporate america mr gupta was honored with the highest trust of leading public companies , and he betrayed that trust by disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets , said robert khuzami , the sec s director of enforcement , in a statement directors who violate the sanctity of boardroom confidences for private gain will be held to account for their illegal actions the proceeding against mr gupta perhaps most acutely stings goldman , which has had at least three runins with the sec over the last year last summer , it struck a 550 million settlement with the agency over its sale of a complex mortgage investment , without admitting or denying wrongdoing and earlier this year it canceled an opportunity for its clients to invest in facebook because of worries that the publicity around the deal could violate sec rules a goldman spokesman declined to comment the sec case ties mr gupta to mr rajaratnam , the sri lankanborn billionaire hedge fund manager at the center of the government s insider trading inquiry mr rajaratnam , who is fighting the criminal charges against him , is to go on trial on tuesday the sec filing contends that mr gupta provided details about goldman s financial health and plans after the collapse of lehman brothers rocked the financial markets on sept 23 , 2008 , the goldman board met via telephone to consider and approve mr buffett s 5 billion purchase of preferred shares in goldman immediately after disconnecting from the board call , gupta called rajaratnam from the same line , the sec filing says a minute later , galleon funds bought more than more than 175 , 000 shares of goldman just minutes before the market closed , the agency says after the close , goldman announced the investment , and its shares rallied on the vote of confidence by mr buffett the galleon funds netted a profit of more than 900 , 000 , the sec says in another instance , the sec said that mr gupta passed along an illegal goldman tip to mr rajaratnam after a call that previewed goldman s positive quarterly earnings results one week before they were publicly announced soon after , mr gupta is said to have initiated a flurry of telephone calls with mr rajaratnam , who then directed his fund to load up on goldman stock and call options when the stock rose the next day , mr rajaratnam exited his positions and earned more than 136 million in profits , the sec said mr gupta is also accused of disclosing information to mr rajaratnam about p g s 2008 fourthquarter earnings on the eve of their release in the long investigation of mr rajaratnam , thousands of conversations were recorded , including some with mr gupta but the sec filing refers to none of those conversations in recounting phone calls between the two men , the filing does not provide details

jeffrey colman , a chicago lawyer , got a collect call tuesday from a convicted murderer at menard correctional facility in downstate chester if only his clients at the guant namo bay detention camp could have made similar calls mr colman mentioned the call when i broached the latest news in the unseemly history of the camp set up after the sept 11 attacks the obama administration has flipflopped , and as a result will wind up prosecuting the man accused of masterminding the attacks before a military commission at guant namo , in cuba , not in a civilian court in the united states the commissions may not be nearly as offensive as some critics suggest but president obama promised to shut the camp in his campaign and in a declaration a few days after his inauguration in 2009 political pushback arose , so the prison is still there , and the vast majority of detainees have never been charged with an offense recent legislation , pushed by republicans , further complicates getting them out it s frustrating for chicago lawyers who have labored pro bono for years to defend detainees most are from mainstream , corporate firms all with whom i spoke were 2008 supporters of mr obama each is annoyed with him over guant namo lowell sachnoff , thomas sullivan , matthew o'hara , patricia bronte , candace gorman and mr colman are among those who have regularly hopped a puddle jumper from fort lauderdale , fla , for a threehour flight to guant namo there , they endure frequent searches and patdowns , forbidden even to have a paper clip , staple or rubber band affixed to documents in a client s presence very broad security classification means that , even back in the office , the lawyers ca n't discuss much with any colleague lacking a security clearance if that colleague does have clearance , the two must go to a room , close the door and shut the blinds if lawyers write a brief referencing classified information , they cannot type a single word in chicago instead , they must fly to washington , go to a secure building none would identify it for me and write it on classified government computers each lawyer felt a moral obligation to get involved mr sachnoff has had an impressive career in antitrust , securities and civil rights litigation mr sullivan is the former united states attorney in chicago mr colman was on track to be a federal judge when nominations fell victim to clintonera feuding between the white house and senate republicans mr sachnoff and mr o'hara , a business litigator with hinshaw culbertson , originally teamed to represent a , a syrian and a tajik the palestinian spent eight years in solitary confinement without being charged , and was released to spain the syrian spent eight and a half years , was never charged and was released to bulgaria the tajik , who has been there nine years and never charged , remains mr colman handled four clients three saudis and an iraqi , all now released but not before incarcerations lasting four to seven years without charges the lawyers said many of their clients were originally sold to american forces for bounty in our hunt for terrorists in all , 775 men have been held at guant namo since jan 11 , 2002 172 remain today of that group , 89 have been cleared for release , with the problem being where to send them thirtysix are designated for prosecution fortyseven will be held indefinitely with no trials because the government does n't believe there s actual evidence that can be used against them guant namo conflicts with an american ideal that i care about , and that s respect for human rights and the rule of law , mr sachnoff said like other bigfirm lawyers , he gained the approval of his firm s board for his involvement , and also ran it by one key wall street client it was alternately the most depressing , frustrating , sometimes exhilarating , experience of my 37year career , said mr colman , who made 10 trips to guant namo , including a weekend when three detainees died , by suicide , according to the united states his firm , jenner block , took on 20 cases as it represented its usual mix of prominent corporations and individuals that 600 detainees have been released without ever saying we are sorry is one of the most appalling things in us history , mr colman said mr sullivan calls it all outrageous , while mr o'hara recounted his syrian client s instant doubts about american fairness it shows the limits of your profession when you have to ultimately confess to clients that things you said to them that they should believe in american justice and courts are wrong , mr o'hara said
a quick tour of the games in week 10 , including some terrible tackling , an eagles team that ca n't close and tim tebow s \( count 'em \) two pass completions in a victory 49ers 27 , giants 20 few prognosticators would have predicted a 49ers victory if told beforehand that frank gore would rush for 0 of his team s measly 77 yards against the nfc eastleading giants take away the run game , you take away the entire 49ers offense or so we thought alex smith had his best outing of the season , regardless of what his goodbutnotgreat numbers might say he was able to sustain offense through the air early and late , with no critical turnovers against a typically fierce giants pass rush the victory can also be attributed to a handful of big secondhalf defensive plays , including carlos rogers s second interception it was a wideopen pick , as the exredskin had perfect underneath positioning against a route that mario manningham , much to the surprise of eli manning , broke off patrick willis erupted in the fourth quarter , perhaps after hearing all week that the secondyear star navorro bowman had become san francisco s best linebacker willis was quick to diagnose and close in on tackles , and he was effectively physical in coverage seahawks 22 , ravens 17 the ravens have become like a toptier nba team they show up in full force for rivalry games and take their foot off the gas for the presumably easy midseason road trips baltimore s three losses this season at tennessee after blowing out pittsburgh in the season opener , at jacksonville after destroying houston and , sunday at seattle after another win over pittsburgh one commonality amongst the three losses is the disappearance of ray rice his stat line in losses reads 13 carries for 43 yards , eight for 28 and , most recently , five for 27 the headlines say that marshawn lynch rushed for 109 yards against this stingy ravens d but it took him 32 carries to get there credit lynch for his tenacity he iced the game with broken tackles down the stretch but also credit the outcome in part to ravens kick returner david reed he lost two fumbles and drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the first half that led to six easy seahawk points those are the types of mistakes that divisionround playoff teams , not super bowl teams , make in trap games bears 37 , lions 13 just one of those games that got away from the lions they 're now considered the thirdbest team in the nfc north , and the tease for their thanksgiving showdown wo n't be about possibly catching the packers but instead about fighting for a wildcard berth seeing the bears post 37 points with methodical offense and crazy return touchdowns feels comforting and familiar like the aroma of your mother s best recipe or memories of summer camp backtoback picksixes to open the second half and devin hester s 82yard punt return score before that gave chicago a leaguehigh seven touchdown returns on the season that matches their combined total of the '09 and '10 seasons in '08 the bears had seven touchdown returns \( in '07 they had eight and in their super bowl '06 season they had nine \) saints 26 , falcons 23 this game lends more evidence to what greg cosell , the executive producer of the nfl matchup show , has been saying for years the biggest myth in football is that you must establish the run in order to set up playaction in truth , wellexecuted playaction works regardless of how a team is running new orleans gained just 41 yards on 16 carries in this game yet according to espn s stats and information , drew brees completed 17 of 19 passes for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns after a playaction fake \( for more on this game , see this separate post on the falcons' controversial decision to go for it on fourth down in their territory in overtime \) steelers 24 , bengals 17 mike wallace is widely regarded as a top10 wide receiver hines ward is on the decline but still venerated for his blocking and pedigree heath miller is the steady , perpetually underrated tight end and last season , emmanuel sanders started to emerge as the longterm no 2 wideout but right now , the fastestrising stock in pittsburgh is that of antonio brown the sixthround pick from a year ago has 39 catches for 540 yards in nine games he led the steelers with 86 yards on five receptions sunday , thanks to a threecatch , 57yard outburst on the final drive of the first half \( which culminated with a field goal \) ravens corner lardarius webb recently said that brown is pittsburgh s best receiver mike tomlin calls brown the hardest worker on the team he s a quick , polished route runner who can gain yards after the catch and locate the soft spots deep in a zone ben roethlisberger loves to go to his inside receivers on third down and in spread formations expect brown to align inside more and more rams 13 , browns 12 let s none of us pretend to have watched this game perhaps we could have watched it if the nfl had n't scheduled 10 early window games and just three late window games the league has been good about balancing early and late window schedules in recent weeks , but every so often it gets caught up in catering to the local markets and forgets about red zone channel viewers and sunday ticket subscribers if there had been , say , only eight early window games and five late window games , or an even more balanced sevensix split , then all of the matchups including awful ones like this could at least be acknowledged instead , we 're left to wonder because there just was n't room to turn to this channel on sunday dolphins 20 , redskins 9 see gripe above cowboys 44 , bills 7
east rutherford , nj for about 15 minutes at the new meadowlands stadium here on saturday night the kenny chesney who could be paid a visit to the kenny chesney who is first came a moody approach to his hit from his quadrupleplatinum 2004 album when the sun goes down a languid song about fleeting summer love that had the grit of dark soul music , replete with choked singing by mr chesney and hushed singalongs from the crowd following that came from the same album and one of the high points of mr chesney s career , a song about fear of aging that ends up eschewing regret for embrace mr chesney sang it backed only by piano , practically silencing the tensofthousandsstrong crowd finally came the highlight of last year s the darkest album of mr chesney s career , not that that s hard work he sang it unaccompanied , just him and his acoustic guitar , as if james taylor impersonations were de rigueur they 're not , of course not for these contemplative moments but rather based on his belief that there s no problem that ca n't be solved with a pair of flipflops , a catamaran and a willingness to bury your problems and possibly your head in the sand if you watch enough tv , you know the world s got problems , mr chesney said , just before those three songs , when he played no shoes , no shirt , no problems , an archetypal chesney watercolor , which got the soused and enthusiastic crowd rollicking and shouting and doffing shirts \( some men , anyway \) just after those three was living in fast forward , an aimless arenalite rock number that was complemented by video footage of nascar crashes on a screen behind mr chesney it s these other sorts of songs the dozens mr chesney has made hits in the last decade , and the ones that otherwise filled this show that allowed him to play a space the size of new meadowlands stadium , making for the biggest country show in the area in years he has turned country into a lean and pulsing frat party on the beach sweating through his sleeveless tshirt , with a weathered cowboy hat keeping the misting rain at bay , mr chesney motored through his twoandahalf hour set he was still as peppy at the end , when no one onstage was safe from getting a huge running hug from him , as in the beginning , when he sailed over the crowd in a suspended chair while singing live a little no country star is more physical than mr chesney , who is small and sinewy and has no problem making a large space feel small by running all around it he shook water bottles over himself and his band members even when he paused for breath hunched over , arms extended , hands on knees he glowed with the ecstasy of hard work mr chesney s heavy revving does n't compensate for his voice s fundamental neutrality , though apart from his midshow soul interlude he mostly let the guitars and fiddle in his band do the work , creating big , friendly structures the goofy she thinks my tractor s sexy , on which he was joined by the opener billy currington , or the odes to irresponsibility beer in mexico and out last night mr chesney was better when less was asked of his voice , as on the unexpected barking cover of the violent femmes' blister in the sun \( performed with the songwriter mark tamburino \) , or when rapping with uncle kracker , another opener , on kid rock s cowboy during the encore mr chesney performed a miniset with the zac brown band , his main opening act , covering songs by alabama , steve miller , bob marley and tom petty they were joined onstage at the end by rex ryan , the head coach of the jets nick swisher of the yankees and dozens of others the yankees had defeated the tampa bay rays by 92 earlier in the day , and the jets were relieved to have the nfl lockout over none of them appeared to be concerned about a thing
finally on sunday , the nfl stopped aaron rodgers at something rodgers passed for 281 yards and 2 touchdowns before he was pulled late in the third quarter of the ' 4616 dismantling of the oakland raiders rodgers has thrown for at least two touchdowns in 13 consecutive games , the packers are 130 and rodgers is a lock for the league s most valuable player award just one problem rodgers needed 310 yards to remain on a pace to break s singleseason passing record of 5 , 084 yards , one of the nfl s most enduring records he now has to average 320 yards in the packers' final three games to pass marino yet marino s record is far from safe for just the second time since marino set it in 1984 , someone is on a pace to break the record after 13 games , and for the first time , there are multiple players threatening to do so this late in the season according to the elias sports bureau , before this season , only two players had been on pace to break the record with four or fewer games to play rich gannon in 2002 \( through 12 and 13 games \) and in 2008 \( through 12 games \) on sunday , four quarterbacks moved closer to the record , indicative of a game that is in a golden era at the position the saints' brees , who fell 16 yards short of breaking the record in 2008 , threw for 337 yards against tennessee and is well ahead of marino s pace , needing to average 239 yards in new orleans' final three games to pass him that should be routine for brees he has passed for fewer than 239 yards only once this season , in a loss to the st louis rams the new england patriots' , who passed for 357 yards sunday you would never know it from he had with the offensive coordinator bill o'brien must average 270 to stay on pace he has had fewer than 270 yards three times this season and just behind rodgers is the newest , perhaps most surprising , entrant in on sunday night , manning passed for 400 yards , giving him a careerhigh 4 , 105 for the season , elite quarterbacking by a player who is often overlooked when the current pantheon of greatness is considered manning has to average 327 yards in the giants' final three games to break marino s record , not too farfetched considering he has averaged 316 yards a game this season that marino s record has stood for so long given the nfl s inexorable tilt toward the pass and its adoption of rules to protect quarterbacks and wide receivers is testament to just how extraordinary his season was , especially at a time when offenses were far more balanced between the run and the pass the glut of challengers this season says plenty about the nfl , too rodney harrison , the former patriots safety who is now an analyst on nbc s football night in america , points to the rules changes , like those that protect the quarterback in the pocket and defenseless receivers downfield , that favor the offense harrison said he believed that because teams could not build defenses able to stop offenses with plenty of weapons and the rules to exploit them , they instead opt to spend their money to develop highpowered offenses that can outscore everybody the most successful of those teams keep their offenses in place over several years gannon , who finished with 4 , 689 yards in 2002 , said you 're talking about elite players with a lot of continuity the same playcaller , the same systems , the same receivers they really benefited from the lockout they could have gone into week 1 with 90 percent of the offense in without much of a training camp all that contributes to a certain comfort level , a certain functionality , and these guys are just cutting it loose all the playcallers are very aggressive , and each of these quarterbacks has a lot of flexibility at the line of scrimmage to change plays and protections if you 're mike mccarthy , are you going to run the ball 30 times with ryan grant , or let aaron rodgers throw it \? in gannon s case , there was not much made of how close he was to marino s record in 2002 until about week 11 or 12 but his experience also shows that it takes a perfect confluence of events to get the record gannon s pursuit was shortcircuited by a deluge at oakland for a late december game against the kansas city chiefs gannon remembered there being six inches of rain on the field in some spots the raiders attempted only 14 passes that is why gannon says brees has the best chance to break the record the saints play their remaining games indoors , at minnesota and at home against atlanta and carolina because the saints are also likely to be battling for their playoff seeding until the final week , brees will probably not have much rest brady , rodgers and manning play all of their remaining games outdoors , none in a warm climate we could see a couple of them this year , gannon said these guys are special players they are so smart , they are rarely surprised by anything they see defensively defensive coordinators do n't sleep well when they 're on the schedule with their victory over the raiders on sunday , combined with san francisco s surprising loss to the arizona cardinals , the packers need only to win next week at kansas city to secure the top overall seed and homefield advantage throughout the nfc playoffs still , coach mike mccarthy gave the broadest clue yet about how he will manage the final weeks if the packers remained undefeated we do n't play scared , he said read they 're going for it that is a gutsy call , considering that even in the blowout victory over the raiders , the packers might have lost receiver greg jennings to a knee injury at least until the divisional playoff game in midjanuary rodgers was sacked three times , absorbing some nasty hits , including a low one to his legs the best the packers can hope for is exactly what they did sunday build up such insurmountable early leads that rodgers and others can be pulled that may be possible against the chiefs the jets took a 353 lead on kansas city by late in the third quarter sunday but games against chicago and detroit , with both teams battling for playoff spots and with good defenses , could mean rodgers has to stay in the afc playoff picture , a muddle all season with no dominant team like the packers , became murkier sunday the jets forced their way in , tennessee and cincinnati fell out , and there are four teams with 103 records making bids to be the top two seeds the houston texans written off when first matt schaub and then matt leinart were lost for the season are currently the afc s top seed in what will be the first playoff appearance in franchise history they are ahead of two other 103 teams baltimore and new england if the teams remain where they are now , the patriots would host the jets in the wildcard round the other 103 team , the pittsburgh steelers , would be the conference s top wild card if it loses the afc north to the ravens , who swept their season series

was showing is a mausoleum , one of three on the market at woodlawn cemetery in the bronx ms olsen is woodlawn s staff historian in new york , where so much of daily life seems to revolve around real estate , it stands to reason that bigmoney prices and maxims like location , location , location figure in death as well mausoleums change hands just like twobedroom coops or sixstory walkups and with cemeteries running short on space , cemetery officials have been known to call descendants who own longempty gravesites or mausoleums , and suggest a sale at woodlawn , which has more than 1 , 300 mausoleums , there is precedent for such turnover our most famous resale was jc penney , ms olsen said penney , the departmentstore founder , died in 1971 at 95 he bought his from mrs william randolph hearst when she bought another used one , she explained woodlawn s president and chief executive , john p toale jr , interrupted previously owned , he corrected ms olsen barely paused she said that

holds six bodies some have only one some , like the peale mausoleum , have none it has been empty for 55 years ms olsen said the peales were the second owners it was built for charles henry fowler , a methodist bishop who died in 1908 his body spent the next three and a half years in what is called a receiving tomb , a temporary resting place , while the mausoleum was being built \( woodlawn officials say others have spent longer in their receiving tombs the record is 26 years \) in april 1956 , mr toale said , the fowlers' descendants had the bodies by then the bishop s widow and son had also been entombed there moved to a cemetery in paramus , nj two months later , mr toale said , dr norman vincent peale sees a bargain and buys the mausoleum dr peale paid 15 , 000 , according to records at the cemetery ms olsen , the cemetery historian , said letters on file show that dr peale had been corresponding with a monument builder since the late 1940s i would derive great comfort from the purchase of a mausoleum , dr peale wrote at one point but he balked at a price quote of 18 , 000 for a new one at a cemetery in valhalla , ny , saying it was beyond my reach at the time , dr peale was in his 50s , an age , woodlawn officials say , when many people make decisions about where they want to be buried but dr peale lived to be 95 , so for nearly 40 years , the mausoleum just sat there , said his daughter , margaret everett by the time he died in 1993 , the family s focus had shifted to pawling , ny , where dr peale had lived in retirement so dr peale was buried there , as was his widow , ruth , who died in 2008 at 101 mrs everett said she finally saw the mausoleum for the first time a couple of years ago , before she and her relatives decided to sell i did n't realize

the three sisters had postponed their flight from dublin to new york three times already this winter , paying hundreds of euros in change fees , and their disappointment was curdling into frustration for they badly wanted to see broadway s spiderman turn off the dark not out of the morbid curiosity shared by some , but because the musical was the final project of their beloved older brother , tony adams , the show s producer until his sudden death in october 2005 the current producers of spiderman had been delaying opening night again and again , but the sisters had had enough by last wednesday , when the opening was moved \( for a sixth time \) from march 15 to june 14 so on friday joan paybody , maeve gallagher and teresa deane boarded their plane , and by saturday afternoon they were at the foxwoods theater for the 104th preview performance of spiderman \( which they loved , by the way more on that later \) on tuesday , the sisters and other relatives gathered for dinner in soho , mr adams s old neighborhood , to celebrate what would have been opening night a photo of mr adams and his toothy smile lay on the table as the family storytelling began we ve been waiting , really , for five years to see all what our tony had been obsessed with , ms paybody said all he talked about in those last years was spiderman he said it could revolutionize the theater , have rock and roll and flying and a superhero i remember him in 2002 saying he was going to try to get bono and neil jordan to do the show , that it would be the irish taking broadway by storm she was referring to the u2 singer , who ultimately became the show s composer with his band mate the edge , and to the writer and filmmaker , who was considered early on as a possible scriptwriter the sisters , who sat at one end of the table with their brother richard , in from los angeles , said mr adams was an impresario as far back as a boy growing up in the 1960s in dun laoghaire , a seaside town southeast of dublin he loved rock music , and started booking bands for gigs in the area as a teenager after school he would head to mooney s pub , where he told people to call him after 4 pm he had the pub s phone number printed on business cards for his company , hello the word that the mooney s publican would surely use when answering the phone \( as an adult , mr adams named his producing company hello entertainment \) mr adams went on to work in the united states as a film producer , collaborating with the director blake edwards on the pink panther movies and victor victoria he produced the musical version of victor victoria on broadway in 1995 , but did not become seriously involved in another broadway project until marvel entertainment suggested a spiderman musical to him several years later by 2002 he was talking to bono and edge the director , julie taymor and mr jordan and others about the project , which he envisioned as a 25 million musical it would have been a record for broadway at that time that would match aerial flying sequences with u2 s soaring anthems in october 2005 , as mr adams was at edge s tribeca apartment to sign partnership papers , the producer had a stroke he was taken off life support two days later he was 52  his memorial service five years ago was the last time that ms gallagher had been in new york it s a little hard coming back , because new york for us was tony , she said but it s good we re here he literally gave his life to the show we wanted to honor him by seeing this spiderman the sisters and brother said they were delighted with the show through and through ms paybody liked the skewed perspectives of the set design , which shows new york city from a bird s eye view at one point , while ms gallagher had praise for u2 s moodier tunes richard adams said he liked the newly conceived characters of the geek chorus and the spider villainess arachne , since they add something that we don t already know from the spiderman movies none of the siblings have a financial stake in the show mr adams left his estate to his four children and his widow , the singer anne runolfsson , who was among the others at tuesday s dinner ms runolfsson has been circumspect in her own public comments about the musical , given that hello entertainment remains a producer but she said mr adams was always a champion of the show and its creative team i think his spirit lingered for bono and edge , ms runolfsson said and i know that tony really connected with julie , and the last time i saw her , i could see in her eyes that she really cared about tony all of that said , it s hard to imagine what tony would say about the show now he would probably love the spectacle of it all last week the producers of spiderman now a 70 million show replaced ms taymor with a new director , philip william mckinley , after the producers and bono and edge concluded that a new creative leader was necessary to make improvements to the musical  if all of this insider drama has been somewhat interesting to the adams siblings the irish newspapers have covered the show s travails they also said it pretty meaningless compared to the emotional payoff in seeing spiderman finally come to life i took a lot of pride in tony on saturday he had a good idea there , ms gallagher said though if he d been alive , i bet you the show would have opened two years ago
very few golf strokes scare touring pros , quite a few scare the rest of us , and one scares everyone the frightening stroke in question would be the slice putt , the dreaded slider , the one that is forced by the contours of the green to move from left to right for righthanders and from right to left for lefties the slippery slope of putting , the slider comes in different lengths , rolls uphill or down , goes by several names and has been called many unprintable things sliders have ruined more rounds , shortened more careers and left more mental scars than all the snaphooks , coldtops , whiffs , slices and shanks combined as a general rule , handicap golfers hardly ever make the lefttorighter , said dave pelz , a shortgame guru who has spent 30 years gathering data on every imaginable sort of pitch , chip and putt there s a dramatic difference between the number of righttoleft putts made versus lefttorighters , he said , speaking from the perspective of a golfer who putts righthanded at a distance of 10 to 12 feet from the hole , handicap golfers miss three to four times as many lefttorighters as they do righttolefters with so much room for improvement in a part of the game that requires perhaps the least athleticism , one would reasonably assume the fix would be easy and available one would also be wrong , because logic rarely applies to the most counterintuitive of sports two researchers in the early 1990s thought they had found the solution to this putting puzzle tim holman and ed stack , golf enthusiasts and standout basketball players at san jose state , were frustrated with their inability to make sliders with any regularity , so they set about finding answers their premise turned into a study , which turned into a manuscript for their selfpublished book , the art and science of switchputting , a treatise radical for the time on why righthanded golfers who had trouble with sliders needed to learn to putt them lefthanded they gave a copy to wally goodwin , who was the stanford university golf coach goodwin asked holman and stack to administer their test to his 1993 team , which included the threetime allamerican notah begay none of them were surprised by the results four of the top five players made 14 percent fewer lefttorightbreaking putts than righttolefters wally brought ed and me in and told us , 'i 've been watching my players miss that lefttoright putt for years , ' holman said nobody ever reads enough break into that putt to start with then they leave the face open and block it , and it s heading south with no chance of ever getting close ten years earlier , holman and stack had persuaded the former pga tour regular and current nbc commentator roger maltbie to try their switchputting method , with some success but with little fanfare after the stanford test , they made a believer of begay , who putted from both sides of the ball as a professional starting in his nike tour season of 1998 and during his 11year pga tour career , which has been interrupted by serious back injuries i think there s an inherent advantage to switchputting , said begay , 38 , who used the method exclusively while winning four tour events in 11 months in the 1999 and 2000 seasons but i think inside 15 feet is probably the maximum distance you want to go with it once you get outside 15 feet , then speed becomes the focal point over line when it comes to lag putting , i find it loses some of its advantage so what does this mean for amateurs \? short of taking sam snead s legendary advice to take two weeks off and quit , or going through the difficult process of learning to switchputt from the other side of the ball , there is hope for amateurs seeking to overcome the pitfalls of the lefttorighter brad faxon , one of the three best putters of the last 30 years , likes to keep it simple he rolls his eyes about all the hypertechnical advice being ladled out these days , saying i think the science of putting is hurting a lot of tour players i think this having to do it one way have to have a perfect setup , have to be square i think it ruins a lot of guys his advice \? most of the guys do n't aim it at the right place and do n't start it at the right place , he said when you putt a breaking putt , make sure you do n't start it on the wrong line for practice , putt it with a tee to aim at put an object just left of your line so that if you pull it , you 'll hit that that s probably as technical as i 've gotten the shortgame expert stan utley , who has a long list of students among tour players and a growing one among amateurs , says it is a matter of training one s roving eyes anytime a player is hitting a breaking putt , it s easy for their eyes to veer toward the hole , utley said their last look really needs to be on the start line what i 'll do with some students is , after they 're lined up far enough to the left and before they take their last look , i 'll step right in front of them where they ca n't see the hole and tell them , 'now hit the putt where your putter s aimed' all of a sudden , they do n't hit a pushcutblock to the right they hit it like any other putt ah , yes the pushcutblock to the right , a chain of bad events that starts when the player s head moves , an open putter ensues and the blade cuts across the ball and sends it low and off line as ugly as that sounds , and as horrid as it looks , it is not an affliction limited solely to weekend hackers or high handicappers quite possibly the single most gruesome example of this butchered stroke occurred in 1970 at the british open at st andrews , when doug sanders had a 4foot lefttoright putt to win his first major championship sanders , whose colorful career included 20 victories but no majors can still be seen in the mind s eye as he opens the putter blade and misses the hole entirely shocked , he starts to reach over with his putter to drag the ball back for a redo before , mercifully , remembering where he is sanders lost a playoff the next day to jack nicklaus , who , fittingly , made a 5foot downhill slider to close out his onestroke victory nicklaus and tiger woods come to mind as the two golfers in the modern era who have shown almost no weakness when it comes to making the crucial , pressurepacked , hardsliding lefttorighter nicklaus , however , acknowledged for this article that he found nothing at all easy about the putt most find more difficult than any other anytime you are going against the grain of what you are doing , it becomes more difficult , he said you are making a righthanded swing , it opens and shuts , and that would be a swing of right to left if you have a righttoleft swing and the ball is going the other way , it s a harder combination i would think any golfer would agree that it s always been the case nicklaus should know in 1990 , at the united states senior open at ridgewood country club in new jersey , he needed a 5foot slider to save par at the 71st hole and keep alive his chances of catching lee trevino , who was watching from the television tower with a onestroke lead as nicklaus was over the putt , trevino said , jack sometimes peeks on these short lefttorighters , which is just what the golden bear did , coming out of the putt just enough to make it lip out another slider missed this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos the touring pro notah begay , who was introduced to switchputting at stanford , putts from opposite sides depending on the break righthanded , above , or lefthanded \( photographs by michael cohen getty images craig jones allsport \)

admittedly , a taco stand in jacinto city would have been the ideal place to eat breakfast with rodney crowell , as east houston is n't just the setting but virtually the primary character in that singersongwriter s new memoir , chinaberry sidewalks the 1950s part , at least , we got right dining outside at west austin s zocalo cafe , we sat directly across the street from nau s enfield drug , which opened in 1951 and is now austin s only original fullservice drug store , soda fountain and grill it s the kind of place time forgot the kind mr crowell lives for the oyster shells have receded and , obviously , houston is n't quite the same , said mr crowell , 60 , who frequently revisited his childhood neighborhoods across the 11 years it took him to write the book my houston was paved in those shells part of the soundtrack was the crunch of tire hitting shells , he continued the other part was the jukeboxes , sitting outside stores and icehouses , propped up on soda crates , rusting in the weather you 'd hear jimmy reed bouncing off the oyster shells hank williams lingered a foot above those shells frogman henry , too the music hung close to the ground like a fog the music hung close to the ground like a fog this is the kind of smart and evocative metaphor that has made mr crowell one of nashville s most indemand songwriters he may be best known for writing hits for emmylou harris and bob seger , but mr crowell also enjoyed five no 1 country hits on his 1988 record diamonds dirt and yet at breakfast , mr crowell delivered the line with serious nonchalance , like it was a throwaway , barely looking up from his huevos rancheros he might even see a line like that as a step backward he said that the single toughest thing about transitioning from songwriter to memoirist was steering clear of metaphorical cleverness as a songwriter , metaphor is instinctual , he said like a rolling stone like a bird on a wire but when those big metaphors stand on their own , it starts to read like overperformance i had to wean myself off of that mr crowell is not at all shy about his desire to be taken seriously as a writer , or about his fears that readers assume a book by a musician is just another selfserving , careerspanning tellall so by design , chinaberry sidewalks hangs on a taut timeline mr crowell s childhood his parents a harddrinking father and a steadfastly religious mother fuel a tale rooted in poverty , domestic violence and corporal punishment mr crowell largely hangs back as the narrator of his parents' story , yet not too far back at one point he breaks up his parents' party by firing a shotgun at another , he breaks up a serious fight between his parents by coldcocking himself with a dr pepper bottle those are huge gestures , mr crowell said of his efforts to keep peace in the house i had to go big to calm the storm my parents were grownups behaving like children it made me develop one of those onlyintexas traits the act of big audacity at breakfast , none of that big audacity was on display mr crowell may be a member of the nashville songwriters hall of fame , but the biggest gesture he made at zocalo was excitedly mixing the watermelon and coconut aguas frescas into the same glass then again , it would be hard to top the showmanship of the night before , when mr crowell read , sang and signed at bookpeople kelly willis and bruce robison , mr crowell s texas songwriting colleagues , shared a laugh when he reached for a pair of reading glasses with darkly tinted lenses they 're a nod to roy orbison , said mr crowell , who had the glasses commissioned after seeing a photo of himself reading with regular bifocals before i got to know him , we were going to an awards show and i was a few paces behind him in walking into the building he had on a black shirt and seemed very demure , not like a star two steps before he entered the building , he pulled out a pair of dark glasses and turned up his collar he became roy orbison he became only the lonely' sometimes you have to step into it for his next act , mr crowell plans to blur the literary and music worlds again , this time with an album of songs he wrote with mary karr , the memoirist who rose to fame with the liar s club \( she s from vidor i'm from jacinto city we call it conversations across the swamp , ' he said , joking \) he s also beginning to plot the followup to chinaberry sidewalks on the way back to the hotel , mr crowell tested the water with a story about spending a week in jamaica with johnny cash , his onetime fatherinlaw unlike his current book , which gives only the most subtle indications that its narrator would grow up to be a musician , the followup will focus on his music career but it wo n't be a traditional rock 'n' roll memoir they say if you want to learn how to write a book , write a book , mr crowell said i have to write another book because of everything i 've learned since i finished this one i'm always looking for the next brush stroke
detroit d j vu is probably inevitable for the , what with the riverajeterposada generation being around so long sometimes it seems events are happening for the second , or the thousandth , time on tuesday night , d j vu was back , in all its capricious glory , with the yanks relying upon an unlikely starter to get them back to the bronx this motor city game of chicken had not happened for all of five years in 2006 the yankees ended their season right here in detroit , but five years later , , who was not in the plans for a start in this series , pitched five and twothirds innings as the yanks beat the , 101 , helped by two acrobatic catches by curtis granderson in center field the fifth and final game of this division series will be in the bronx on thursday burnett is not exactly a nonentity he had the secondhighest total of starts on the yankees' staff this year , 32 , but finished none , with an 1111 record and a 515 earnedrun average he was starting only because of the rainout in the bronx last friday that burned up the anticipated showdown between justin verlander and c c sabathia when rain fell after verlander pitched one inning and sabathia pitched two , it was n't hard to predict that the younger and harderthrowing verlander could bounce back better than sabathia , which was exactly what happened monday night  yankees fans were sounding like yankees fans , projecting gloom over burnett s presence , but tiger manager jim leyland before the game i'm not underestimating him a bit , leyland said he s got great stuff a j burnett is capable of going out and throwing a twohitter tonight i know that he has great stuff you know the scenario is this is a good situation for a j , i think , on this stage tonight people are hot and cold about a j and everything not us we know what a great talent he is if he gets it going , he can wipe you out actually , burnett almost wiped himself out , loading the bases on walks \( the middle one intentional \) and prompting a visit from the pitching coach , larry rothschild the yankees , everybody knew , were not going to wait too long for burnett to settle down don kelly lashed a drive to center field that granderson barely hauled down high above his head if the ball had gone past granderson , kelly would have had a basesclearing triple , maybe even an insidethepark home run instead , burnett more or less did what leyland had suggested there would be no meltdown , as there was in 2006 , when the yankees sent out creaky old randy johnson and lost the third game as kenny rogers , who with his tentative style , flummoxed the yankees , 60 that put the tigers up , two games to one , just like this year this kind of groundhog day repetition is inevitable when you consider that mariano rivera , derek jeter and jorge posada have all been here since the 1995 season , although in marginal roles that year here s one example of yankee d j vu in 1998 , interrupted a friday night postseason game , but the yankees survived to eliminate the rangers at 2 26 am last year , 12 years later , on another friday evening in another postseason , another texas storm struck , this time during the national anthem it was great fun watching the texas grounds crew nearly holding the flag during the national anthem but the rain whipped through quickly and last year the rangers put the yanks out of their misery the detroit series of 2006 and 2011 had similarities for the fourth game of 2006 , the role of burnett was played by , the fourth starter \( \) with the yanks' season on the line , the tigers took an eightrun lead before holding on for an 83 victory that day is also remembered because alex rodriguez was demoted by torre to the eighth spot in the lineup after the loss that day , torre had to answer not only for the loss but for dropping arod to eighth with the wolves baying after the loss , brian cashman , the general manager then and now , stood outside the yankees' clubhouse and asked if the reporters were daft torre was a good manager , and would be back that lasted until the next october , when the midges of cleveland got into the yankees' breathing passages rodriguez is still around , his still having six years to go he has been playing third base well but mechanically , his 36yearold body and a sprained left thumb he was hitless in 12bats in this series until his two singles in the eighth , but he did drive in his third run with a sacrifice fly jeter , who struck out in the two losses , got the big hit this time with a tworun double in the third burnett held on long enough to turn the lead over to the bullpen joe girardi , who had been about burnett , now takes the yankees home for a fifth game , unlike torre in 2006 d j vu goes only so far

this week house republicans overwhelmingly rejected a plan to raise the nation s debt ceiling without simultaneous cuts in taxes and spending , setting up a showdown with president obama this summer over the budget mr obama is not the first president to confront the cerberus of debt limits , taxes and spending cuts indeed , lyndon b johnson s struggle in 1967 and 1968 to raise the debt ceiling , ward off draconian spending cuts and raise taxes offers important lessons for mr obama the first problem for johnson was how much the government could go into debt because of increased domestic spending and the war in vietnam , the deficit grew rapidly during the 1960s , and in 1967 we on the white house staff asked congress to raise the country s debt ceiling it was n't the first such request before 1967 raising the limit had been routine , supported in the senate by almost all democrats and liberal republicans even in the house , where members faced reelection every other year and thus largely opposed such measures , we believed a favorable vote was inevitable so , despite highdecibel opposition to raising the limit unless money for johnson s great society programs was cut , at our insistence representative wilbur mills , a conservative democrat from arkansas and the chairman of the house ways and means committee , brought the proposal to the house floor on june 7 to our surprise the bill was rejected , 210 to 197 enough liberal democrats had joined republicans and conservative democrats to defeat the bill , attributing their negative votes to opposition to the vietnam war , which , they charged , was shortchanging domestic programs johnson was furious there s plenty of money for domestic programs , he told me tell them we 're prepared to put big public housing projects right in the middle of their districts to show their constituents how much money is available for domestic programs maybe that 'll change their minds this was n't just an idle threat he knew that a little hardball , combined with some wellplaced promises , could save the bill indeed , after some choice conversations with liberal representatives and a quiet commitment to conservatives to curb domestic spending the increase passed the house on june 21 but that was n't the end of johnson s woes like mr obama now , he knew that he had to raise taxes to reduce the deficit \( though johnson s 28 billion in red ink was chump change compared to today s trillions \) and that congress and the public would strongly oppose such a move for months , johnson resisted going to congress he had predicted that all hell will break loose indeed , when , a few weeks after the debt limit increase , johnson proposed a 10 percent income tax surcharge on corporations and most individuals , congress put our entire budget education , food stamps , even our proposal to finance a public broadcasting system on the chopping block then as now , most members of congress preferred spending cuts , especially in programs for the poor , to increasing taxes on the affluent again , johnson played rough he ordered reductions in defense , highway and public works spending to win support from governors who would be affected by such cuts but none of this mollified mills and other conservatives the white house and congress fought over the tax bill for the rest of the year and into 1968 most people forget that much of johnson s famous tv speech on march 31 , in which he announced that he would not run for reelection , was an urgent plea that congress pass the bill eventually johnson reluctantly agreed to a 6 billion reduction in domestic spending as the price for passage of his tax surcharge it was a clever move rather than compromise on the tax bill itself , he simply let congress make its own budget cuts betting that it would n't agree on what and how much to slash he was right congress cut less than 4 billion from the 1969 budget he even got the last laugh , as the year ended with a 32 billion surplus , the first in decades , and the great society survived in other words , johnson won because he knew capitol hill s pressure points like a great general , he understood the difference between tactics \( the private promise , the discreet promise \) and strategy \( the order of bills , his legislative goals \) and he understood how to make them work together today the white house confronts a similar need to raise the debt limit and eventually increase taxes , alongside demands that domestic spending be sharply reduced true , mr obama faces a more divided congress and an unemployment rate more than double that of 1967 , but not the kinds of divisions over race and war that prompted johnson not to seek reelection mr obama would be wise to look to the fiscal battles of 1967 and 1968 for inspiration to slay his own political cerberus without savaging social programs will take a similar measure of commitment , political wiliness and courage
last year , pamela kelley went to her landlord with a business proposition she would move out of her rentcontrolled apartment in the russian hill neighborhood of san francisco if the owner agreed to turn the unit into a vacation rental and pay ms kelley to manage it tourists are our bread and butter in this city , and many want that real san francisco experience , not a hotel , said ms kelley , 48 , who previously ran a cleaning service and a trophy engraving business the arrangement has been lucrative for both ms kelley and the landlord , harold wong as a tenant , ms kelley paid 2 , 100 a month for her onebedroom apartment it now brings in 225 a night for mr wong more than 6 , 700 a month if the unit is fully booked ms kelley receives a 10 percent commission it s just better utilizing your assets to get a better return , mr wong said he has since turned over to ms kelley a second apartment to manage as a vacation rental , and he is exploring additional conversions at the 13 properties his family owns throughout san francisco such conversions are largely illegal under san francisco s rentcontrol laws , but according to census figures released last month , the practice of converting private residences into what are effectively hotels is widespread in some popular san francisco neighborhoods , there are now more housing units dedicated to seasonal , recreational or occasional use than there are available apartments for rent in one section of russian hill , 176 second homes were available for rent , compared with 115 vacant apartments , the census showed in rincon hill near att park , there were 594 second homes and 189 available rentals another census tract , in pacific heights , had 129 vacation homes and 95 units for rent it s become a very active speculative industry to be affirmatively turning rental apartments into hotels , said ted gullicksen , executive director of the san francisco tenants union the census counted 5 , 564 vacation homes in san francisco up from 3 , 764 in 2000 and 1 , 509 in 1990 \( san jose , by contrast , had 845 vacation homes , according to the census oakland had 633 \) christine haw , code enforcement supervisor in the san francisco planning department , said the trend was deeply troubling they are taking away from the city s affordable housing stock and the amount of units available for permanent residents , ms haw said and yet the city is enabling the rapid growth of vacation rentals a threedecadeold ordinance forbids san francisco property owners from renting out a private residence for fewer than 30 days without acquiring an expensive permit to convert the property to tourist use but the measure is essentially unenforced ms haw said the city did not have enough staff members to investigate dozens of complaints the planning department had received about illegal rentals we 'd have to go out at night to verify that the person is renting out the property illegally , she said they are difficult cases to prove jack song , a spokesman for city attorney dennis herrera , said mr herrera was aware that there are violations but the city attorney s office has not initiated legal action against a single property owner , mr song said , because neither the planning department nor the department of building inspection has referred a case at the same time , san francisco s treasurer has begun collecting a 14 percent hotel tax from landlords who rent apartments to outoftowners on a shortterm basis everyone should pay their tax and bring in revenue regardless of being a big operator or small operator , said greg kato , a spokesman for jos cisneros , the city s treasurer mr kato said the city collected 1868 million in hotel tax in the fiscal year that ended june 30 , 2010 , but he could not estimate what percent of that came from shortterm rentals owners of some properties , like mr wong , have voluntarily paid the hotel tax , believing that will lessen the possibility of enforcement from other parts of city government hundreds of san francisco properties are listed on web sites like vacation rentals by owner \( vrbo \) , airbnb and craigslist douglas quinby , senior director at phocuswright inc , a travel analysis company based in connecticut , said online listings had been a major driving force behind what he called an extraordinary transformation of the residential real estate market over the past decade ten years ago as a second home owner , you would have to list it with a local real state agency or work with a property management company in a destination to make it work , mr quinby said with the advent of online listing services you can spend a few hundred dollars a year and get your property in front of all sorts of eyeballs and potential guests when julia bergeron of woodland hills , calif , decided to take her family of four to san francisco for memorial day weekend , one of the first places she looked was the vrbo web site the apartment she liked most was ms kelley s old one on larkin street in russian hill even though union square is in the middle of downtown , sometimes it feels kind of grungy , ms bergeron said , but there was none of that where we stayed by then , ms kelley had remodeled the unit to accommodate vacationers , hiring an interior decorator who redid the kitchen in a countrymodern style new curtains were installed , comfortable bedding was provided and an ancient radiator was replaced the entire apartment was painted bright blue for ms bergeron , who has two daughters , 8 and 11 , the main attraction was that it was a onebedroom priced at 225 a night , parking included with a hotel , there s no privacy , and you spend a lot of money eating out , she said ms kelley has taken on three additional properties since moving out of her place on larkin street she manages an apartment on union street owned by mr wong , and two threestory town houses on green street at the top of russian hill mr gullicksen , of the tenants union , argued that the expansion came at a cost we call it the hotelization' of san francisco , he said seniors , families and lowincome tenants are being pushed out we have to fight for every affordable unit but ms kelley said she doubted that the city would ever enforce laws against shortterm rentals as long as property owners continued to pay the hotel tax and ms kelley predicted that more units would be turned into vacation rentals as landlords sought to avoid rentcontrol laws available to longterm tenants the city has made its bed with restrictive rentcontrol laws , she said , but with a vacation rental you can avoid that fred waldman , a professor at the university of california , san francisco , who owns one of the green street properties managed by ms kelley , agrees ,

scott hanson is in his sixth year as a reporter and host for nfl network but he is best known as the host of the addictive nfl redzone channel , which whips from game to game on sunday afternoons , excising the 1yard runs and tedious timeouts and focusing only on the most jawdropping plays and touchdowns hanson , whose highenergy delivery is a perfect match for the snippets of action , said he had had only one cup of coffee in his life a fouryear walkon at syracuse , he earned scoutteam playeroftheyear honors in 1992 redzone broadcasts from los angeles , but hanson was in new york recently to host an nfl event for advertisers and , presumably , to limber up his vocal cords for the season you re on all afternoon amid continuous action when do you go to the bathroom \? that s the no 1 question in my life once or never in seven hours either one twominute break or none at all i m like a kindergartner i have to raise my hand and ask my producer , can you find me a spot to go to the bathroom in the next drive \? i m asking permission and i m a 40yearold man i can hear the games on my earpiece , so i m going down the hallway and i have a path carved out for me to get to the bathroom , and i m literally thinking no touchdown no touchdown you have to know all the players names instantly how do you memorize them \? i ve locked myself in hotel rooms on a saturday and i go through every bit of information i can find on any story line i m in a hotel in los angeles a block from the beach and i m sitting there thinking , i ve got to focus i would love to say i have everyone s name memorized , but i don t i have a spotter and a researcher sitting in my studio two feet from me who s 35 for the bengals \? and they can get it to me if i m doing a play live , i m flying solo i hope it s all stars touching the football with monosyllabic names , preferably dallas clark with the catch ! how do you rehearse \? i would assume it s like being in a rehearsal for a jazz band you can go into the studio saying this person on piano , this on sax , we ll play for x number of hours but when it actually starts , you don t know what the music will lead to that s part of the thrill of it what were you thinking when the nfl approached you about this idea \? they had me do an audition to be named the host and the rehearsal was , i want to say , four hours long me and a producer in my ear i m watching a wall of monitors the longest show i had done in my broadcasting career 15 , 20 years was maybe two or three hours i remember thinking this is heavy lifting you work on fear , like i hope i don t embarrass myself i m a dreamer i knew it would be huge the first thing i said on the air was , you are watching the channel that we hope will change the way you watch football forever that s hyperbole , but i meant it have you ever lost your voice \? i have a stage manager she gives me one bottle of water i m allowed to sip it she says , no chugging she knows i ll have to go to the bathroom i haven t lost my voice , but i am exhausted at the end get any feedback from players \? when a player is on a bye week or playing monday night , at sunday at 1 o clock they re watching the games occasionally , people will tweet we re going to do a new thing this year if there s a pro player with a verified twitter account and he wants to tweet something he sees in another game , we ll incorporate those tweets live
my career as a college football coach began last weekend , when i was hired by san jose state university after finishing last season 112 , the worst record among all division bowl subdivision schools , san jose state was willing to give me , an untested and entirely selftaught football expert , a chance i was determined to make the most of the opportunity i quickly installed a prostyle offense and focused on controlling the ball and clock with a running game and short passes we played conservatively on defense , hoping to limit big plays we consistently got strong performances from our halfback , the unimaginatively named hb 9 we got road wins at ucla and colorado state , and finished the season 57 i felt we 'd turned a corner , a sentiment validated on signing day when , after spending hours and hours working the phones , we signed a fivestar wide receiver who obviously appreciated my pitch stressing program stability this fantastical sequence of events happened over the course of 72 hours thanks to ea sports' new video game ncaa football 12 , out tuesday as a sports simulator , ncaa football 12 is entertaining and immersive , and more than just a version of ea sports' popular madden nfl game with marching bands digitally inserted besides cheerleaders and , yes , marching bands , various mascots and fieldentrance traditions have been included \( when you play a game at auburn , for instance , an eagle soars across the stadium as the team runs onto the field \) these flourishes certainly add to the realism and evoke the spirit of the college football experience unfortunately , they happen at the exact point in the game when most gamers take full advantage of it being a video game and simply press a button to skip directly to kickoff it is hard to find room for improvement in a game that has more than a decade of refinement built in ea sports introduced the ncaa football franchise in 1998 , and has been continuously upgrading ever since in this newest iteration , the most noticeable onfield advance is probably the tackling , which has multiple new animations it is also easier to have success running the ball between the tackles , and defenders playing zone defense have a better grasp of zone principles just as obvious are the cosmetic tweaks , like dreadlocks that swing from the back of some players' helmets , and the blades of grass that fly up from players' cleats on slowmotion replays as they run and cut ea sports has added custom playbooks , which allow users to build diverse playbooks for their teams with up to 40 different formations this is fun in a video game , but in reality would probably require a quarterback to wear a telephonebooksize flip card on his wristband you can also realign conferences , trimming the big ten to 10 teams with its myriad modes and online capabilities , ncaa football 12 is clearly designed to be played again and again for instance , road to glory allows users to create a player , and then attempt to develop him into a college football star that journey begins with a senior season in high school , where you replicate the experience of many elite prep athletes and play both offense and defense for your team after each game , as your stats accrue and signing day approaches , colleges express their interest my eponymous character was most successful as a quarterback , quickly drawing scholarship offers from football factories like ohio state and florida i was evidently less desirable as a middle linebacker my best bids came from three sun belt conference programs the game hits close to reality on many levels i found that the maxims we hear analysts carp about week after week when watching games on television \( eg do n't throw across your body \) are actually effective advice when my quarterback was injured in one contest , erin andrews , part of the game s broadcast team , reported that team doctors suspected he had a concussion kirk herbstreit , the color commentator , then quickly lectured me about the dangers of trying to play through  as realistic as ncaa football 12 is it looks as crisp as a pixar film i still found myself wondering about ways the game can expand in the future for all that is in the game , there is plenty about college football that may never translate digitally despite my undeniable success as a coach , there was no opportunity to hold a fiery news conference after a bad day of practice to motivate my players my coach could not sign up for twitter and defuse his detractors with a signature brand of selfdeprecating humor and i was n't able to deliver a heartfelt speech to my school s boosters , convincing them of my commitment to turning san jose state into a true contender but maybe none of that matters as long as i keep winning , i should keep my job and if i'm not getting the job done , i can always hit restart
if you follow congress \( and who could blame you if you gave up on that years ago \) it s important to look out for normalseeming bills that are , in fact , filled with poisonous little bits of legislative mischief making there s been a lot written already about congressional republicans attaching fasttrack approval of the keystone xl pipeline to the payroll tax bill if you can t see the connection , don t worry , there is none it s all about pushing a terrible idea through congress under the cover of a needed bill and speaking of , there s the national defense authorization act , which includes a bunch of really dangerous changes to the legal system , like taking the fbi and federal prosecutors and courts largely out of the antiterrorism business i ve already vented about that one today , so i ll leave it alone for now here s another good one last friday , the house republican leadership published their version of a law to extend unemployment benefits which congress must do or risk making the recovery even slower for ordinary americans than it already is think progress , a liberal political site , pointed out an interesting passage on page 39 it seems the authors of this legislation thought it might be a good moment to amend the social security act not to make the program more effective , or to ensure benefits for future generations of americans , mind you , but to enable states to require drugtesting for anyone seeking unemployment benefits sadly , it s not really a new idea governors have tried it before in a few states , and the courts so far have resisted because , among other things , it s unconstitutional florida s law requiring drug testing for welfare recipients has been put on hold by a federal judge not to be outdone , representative jack kingston , republican of georgia , has introduced an even more extreme bill that would make drug testing mandatory to receive unemployment benefits \( instead of enabling states to make the decision on their own \) representative george miller of california rightly called the bill just another attempt to demonize the unemployed , most of whom have no job for no fault of their own he added why doesn t he propose to drug test executives at wall street banks \? it was their actions that have been documented to have directly contributed to the recession and high unemployment rate in the first place i m not calling for that , but it s fun to think about read a
philadelphia for years , state health officials missed some unsettling patterns at the threestory brick clinic on lancaster avenue it was always open late , way past the time the pizza place next door closed at midnight the women who emerged from it often poor blacks and hispanics appeared dazed and in pain , and sometimes left in ambulances the doctor who ran the clinic , kermit gosnell , had been sued at least 15 times for malpractice two women died while under his care but the dangerous practices went unnoticed , except by the women who experienced them they were discovered entirely by accident , during a prescription drug raid by federal agents last february the clinic now closed , with dead plants in its windows and old mail on its front desk stands as a grim reminder of how degrading it was for the women who went there and how long state officials ignored their complaints on wednesday , the philadelphia district attorney , seth williams , indicted dr gosnell on eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven infants and a bhutanese refugee who died after a lateterm abortion in 2009 a grand jury report issued on the same day offered its own theory on why so little happened for so long we think the reason no one acted is because the women in question were poor and of color , the report said , and because the victims were infants without identities , and because the subject was the political football of abortion kevin harley , a spokesman for gov tom corbett , said friday that the governor was appalled at the inaction on the part of the health department and the department of state , the two agencies that were responsible for overseeing the clinic mr corbett has ordered an investigation into what happened , mr harley said , and was awaiting recommendations he said he did not know whether any of the officials named in the report would be fired it was raw anxiety that propelled sherry thomas to dr gosnell s clinic in the summer of 1999 she was 38 , she already had three children , and with her partner working as a machinist , she knew they could not afford the fourth child she was pregnant with she left the problem alone for a while , fretting , and then decided to have an abortion she was five months pregnant by the time she had saved enough to afford it she chose dr gosnell s clinic because that was where women she knew went but when she was led into a waiting room , she started having second thoughts it was like walking into a nightmare , she said everyone was sedated , no one was making sense people were slumped over and waiting in line like they were going into a soup kitchen the clinic was smelly , in part from a dirty turtle tank in the lobby , but also from generally squalid conditions the grand jury report said the clinic had blood on the floor , a stench of urine in the air and cat feces on the stairs when agents raided it semiconscious women scheduled for abortions were moaning in the waiting room or the recovery room , where they sat on dirty recliners covered with bloodstained blankets , the report said confusion was a standard reaction to the conditions , women said in interviews last week , but many of the patients were young and lacked confidence and simply sat in silence it was the first time for me , and i did n't know if that s how women usually are , said a young woman who had an abortion at the clinic in 1999 shortly after graduating from college the clinic had as little regard for the patients' dignity as it had for their safety the doctor would arrive late , often after 8 pm , leaving the untrained staff , including dr gosnell s wife , pearl , a cosmetologist , to sedate the women and administer laborinducing drugs , the report said if labor began , the woman was asked to sit on a toilet , and the fetus would drop it would be fished out later so as not to clog the plumbing , the report said the remains of 45 fetuses were found at the clinic during the raid , according to the report some were stored in the staff s refrigerator ms thomas remembers waking up , soaked in her own blood and feeling scared people were moving around her , trying to put her in an ambulance her uterus had been punctured she was rushed to the hospital , where she was given a partial  when i woke up i thought , i might die today , ' ms thomas said dr gosnell offered her 500 , she said , possibly in an effort to avert a lawsuit she had paid 800 for the abortion complaints against dr gosnell date back to 1983 , according to the grand jury report , but none moved state regulators to action some malpractice suits produced settlements that were paid by dr gosnell s insurance company , including nearly 1 million paid to the family of semika shaw , a 22yearold mother of two who died from an infection in 2002 after an abortion at the clinic the report details a sweeping pattern of negligence , with no inspector stepping foot inside the clinic for more than 16 years even the death of karnamaya mongar , a bhutanese refugee who died after a procedure in 2009 , was ignored janice staloski , a health department official , declined to investigate the death , saying the department had no authority to do so , the report said the department s chief counsel , christine dutton , defended the agency s actions to the grand jury , stating bluntly , people die ms thomas tries to forget what happened she felt helpless and disposable in dr gosnell s clinic , and she wants him to feel the same she recalls him joking with her when she lay down on the operating table you 'll be fine , he told her this is just like a walk in the park
as a young graduate student pursuing an advanced degree in modern european history , newt gingrich wrote a dissertation titled belgian education policy in the congo 19451960 thereafter , in the course of writing 23 books , the scholarpolitician pontificated on many subjects , from the pope to a pouting sex kitten , who appears for a quick romp in a novel about the civil war none of his work had anything to do with the home lending practices that would help to destroy the american economy so why would freddie mac pay 300 , 000 to professor gingrich in 2006 just as the troubled mortgage lender was facing calls on capitol hill for increased regulation \? turns out , that was just small change in the overall sweetheart deal that no historian but gingrich could ever get bloomberg news reported this week that gingrich made between 16 million and 18 million for giving additional advice to freddie mac when i asked about the amount , a freddie mac spokesman refused to comment , but officials at the agency who are familiar with the contracts confirmed the numbers reported by bloomberg this is not just another gingrich laugher , up there with his revolving tiffany s account or his multiple personal hypocrisies this story encapsulates why washington is broken and how the powerful protect and enrich themselves , unanchored to basic principles at the same time , it s a case study in the gingrich method denounce something as outrageous , while doing that very outrageous thing himself \( politicians with ties to freddie mac came in for scathing gingrich criticism in 2010 \) there is no evidence , as gingrich claimed last week in a debate , that he offered freddie mac a dime s worth of advice in his capacity as a historian , or warned against a surge in subprime lending to the contrary , former freddie mac executives told bloomberg that gingrich was brought in to help the agency continue down the very path of its ruination backing subprime mortgages plain and simple , gingrich was paid for his influence a former speaker of the house , even a disgraced one , is still worth something and so , what gingrich actually did was praise freddie mac s business model , according to an associated press article in 2008 on top of that , he was asked by executives at freddie to help frame the debate to win over fellow conservatives freddie mac and its sister firm in governmentsanctioned lending assistance , fannie mae , were forced into government receivership in 2008 since then , they have cost taxpayers 181 billion these two agencies are often cited by republicans as the main reason for the financial collapse with gingrich , there ought to be a special category for gall here s what he said when asked in last week s debate about his 300 , 000 deal with freddie my advice as a historian , when they walked in and said to me , we are now making loans to people who have no credit history and have no record of paying back anything , but that s what the government wants us to do , as i said to them at the time , this is a bubble this is insane this is impossible if he can provide a single speech , audio transcript or paper backing this claim , i promise to personally sell copies of belgian education policy in the congo , on street corners for a day and if he had come to such an enlightened and early conclusion about the pending housing collapse , why didn t citizen gingrich sound the alarm for his fellow countrymen \? from this most gaseous of politicians , an oped , or quick sitdown with the sycophants at fox news , would have helped warn a nation of its folly but there is nothing the narrative of newt gingrich as the paul revere of the housing crisis is a selffantasy to cover up his complicity as to the gingrich method , this latest episode is textbook he s best known , of course , for blistering president clinton for his dalliance with monica lewinsky at the same time that he , then speaker , was carrying on an affair with a house aide , now his third wife , callista gingrich in his latest incarnation , gingrich poses as an outsider who will break up the washington establishment a scourge of the elites who feed off its culture of cronyism but after 33 years in washington , if gingrich were any more embedded in the establishment , pigeons would be landing on his shoulder seeking the kind of relief normally accorded statues wednesday , while defending his work for freddie , gingrich said , it reminds people that i know a great deal about washington his taxexempt entity , called american solutions , allows him to make grand policy statements and promote his brand , while his private entity , gingrich productions , is a moneymaking machine most recently , gingrich productions has been cranking out dvds in consort with citizens united , the same group that prompted the infamous supreme court decision that corporations are people and it was gingrich productions , he said on the campaign trail wednesday , that took in all the money from the nowbankrupt lending agency the freddie mac deal shows just how easy it is for former public servants to enrich themselves in this case , a wellconnected politician gets paid an extravagant fee to consult with a runaway mortgage backer that is fighting off calls for increased scrutiny he was hired , bloomberg reported , to build bridges to fellow republicans in congress for added chutzpah , gingrich recently suggested that democratic politicians who were influenced by lobbyists at freddie and fannie ought to go to jail but gingrich draws a distinction for himself i did no lobbying of any kind , he said on wednesday no , that would be wrong
the calls come at least once a week these days , with growing urgency friends of the republican presidential candidates , aides to the candidates , and often the candidates themselves , wondering if al hoffman jr might be ready to lend a hand how are you doing \? what are you feeling \? what are you thinking \? mr hoffman , a florida real estate developer who was a cochairman of s presidential campaigns , said in describing the calls but mr hoffman , one of the s most soughtafter fundraisers , remains unconvinced that he should tap into his extensive network of contacts to raise money for any of them none of the candidates have instantly identified themselves as a leader for the republican movement , mr hoffman said the bush family were instantly identifiable as leaders he is far from alone two and a half years after mr bush left the white house , the formidable network of republican donors he assembled has largely melted away fewer than one in five of mr bush s rangers and pioneers , the elite corps of bundlers who helped mr bush smash fundraising records in his two runs for the white house and remain the gold standard of republican fundraising , have contributed to any of the current republican candidates , according to a new york times analysis their absence underscores the challenges facing the republican party in what could prove to be a protracted primary campaign followed by a hugely expensive general election matchup against an incumbent president no republican candidate for president this year has yet shown the kind of broad appeal that rapidly drew the party s donor establishment to mr bush early in his first run , with only mitt romney , the former massachusetts governor , raising enough money in the early going to assure being competitive through this year in an economy that has drained pocketbooks and inhibited the emergence of a younger class of wealthy donors , no republican candidate has yet been able to seize the imagination and loyalty of a new generation of financial supporters while the eventual nominee will have an opportunity to unite donors now dispersed among the sprawling primary field and benefit from the pools of money backing conservative causes , none of the candidates have yet assembled the kind of bigcheck network that could be confident of keeping up with the fundraising machine built by president obama and some large bundlers , unsatisfied with the presidential field , are choosing to place their bets with the party s congressional wing or with independent expenditure groups , which offer them the ease of writing a single check instead of the grinding work of wrangling contributions from dozens of friends and business associates nobody is inheriting any kind of apparatus left over from the bushes at all , said ray washburne , a dallas entrepreneur and former bush ranger who is backing tim pawlenty , the former minnesota governor everything s going to have to be recreated there are new players who want to play , and there are other people tired and done more of mr bush s former supporters could still emerge later in the race or after the party settles on a nominee , as many rangers and pioneers did for senator john mccain of arizona , the nominee in 2008 some may be awaiting the entry into the presidential race of gov rick perry of texas , though some longtime bush supporters said there was relatively little overlap between mr bush s network of financial supporters and the one built by mr perry , a powerhouse fundraiser in his own right and no fundraising machine exists in perpetuity large networks of bundlers are built first and foremost on the personal loyalty to specific candidates i tried to retire last time , and i really put my foot down this time , said bradford m freeman , a financier who led mr bush s california finance team and was among the top bundlers for mr mccain i was a very close personal friend with president bush it was a labor of love some republicans suggested the bush fundraising machine rested on circumstances that would be hard for other candidates to replicate as the governor of texas , the son of a former president and brother of a florida governor , mr bush could tap into three of the party s most robust networks of supporters in his first campaign , mr bush ran during an economic boom and after eight years of a democratic administration loathed by his party during his second , as an incumbent during wartime we put together a fundraising team that was pretty dang good , said james b francis jr , a texan who organized the pioneer network during mr bush s first run but has not signed on with any of the current republican candidates but it s not monolithic and obviously , when you have a completely different field , and george bush is not in the race , people are going to go in different directions the fragmentation of mr bush s donor network also reflects a lull in the bush dynasty mr bush left office in 2009 his brother , jeb bush , the former florida governor , in 2007 no family member currently holds elective office , and the closest thing to a bush campaign in politics today is maverick pac , cofounded by george p bush , the former president s nephew , to organize republican young professionals the day the 2004 campaign was over , you got a tie , and that was it , mr washburne said those of mr bush s former top operatives still working in politics are scattered around research organizations , lobby shops and independent expenditure groups , some of which are proving attractive for republican donors eager to have an impact in the presidential race but unwilling to pick a candidate yet a jerrold perenchio , the billionaire founder of univision , was a bush pioneer in 2004 and a national finance chairman of mr mccain s 2008 campaign mr perenchio has not yet donated to any of the republican candidates , but in april a trust he controls donated 2 million to , a socalled super pac founded by karl rove , mr bush s former adviser some bush alumni said they believed many former bush donors had decided to cast their lots with mr rove early in the cycle , rather than with the stillfluctuating republican field i do n't think the rangers and pioneers are n't playing , i think they are playing in a new way , said mark mckinnon , a former bush strategist my guess is that many of them have determined their money is much better invested and spent in the super pacs a lot of them know and trust karl rove to give them a good bang for their buck so that s where their bucks are going mr bush s rangers and pioneers are still a prized commodity in republican presidential politics , their allegiance avidly sought by most of the candidates and once won quietly advertised to other potential supporters as evidence of viability and establishment support of those bush bundlers still active in politics , mr romney appears to have drawn the most big names , among them the financier lewis m eisenberg , h gary morse , a florida real estate developer , and sam fox , a former ambassador to belgium their support has helped mr romney lap the republican competition during the three months ending june 30 , he raised 1825 million , four times more than any other candidate
tapping into what it sees as a need for impartial international news on cable , the bbc said friday that it would aggressively seek distribution in the united states for bbc world news , its 24hour news channel but that s in the long term in the short term , the bbc is cutting back on its flagship newscast based in the united states bbc world news america will be moved off of the bbc america cable channel and will be trimmed to 30 minutes from an hour each weeknight the changes were jointly announced friday by bbc global news and bbc worldwide america , two segments of the sprawling british broadcaster bbc world news america , based in washington and coanchored by matt frei and katty kay , was created in 2007 as the broadcaster sought a bigger audience in the united states it is wellregarded by its peers when it earned a peabody award last year , the organization called it a nightly newscast like none the united states has ever had it places our actions and concerns in a global context the newscast , though , wasn t always an easy fit with the rest of the bbc america channel , which features british hits like top gear and doctor who under a new president of bbc worldwide america , herb scannell , the channel is emphasizing entertainment , including in the 7 pm time slot currently occupied by the newscast mr scannell has a plan for two clearly defined cable channels in the united states , bbc america and bbc world news , the company said in a news release but gaining distribution for bbc world news is most likely to be exceedingly difficult bbc america is already available in more than 60 million american homes bbc world news is only available in about six million distributors are generally reluctant to add new channels meanwhile , there is another international news channel seeking the same access to united states households al jazeera english , which has been widely praised for its coverage of the protests in the middle east in recent weeks al jazeera english is currently available in fewer american cable homes than bbc world news starting march 28 , bbc world news america will be moved to bbc world news , shortened to a halfhour and shifted to 4 pm eastern from its current time , 7 pm it will be repeated at 6 pm many pbs stations across the country already carry bbc newscasts , and under the new arrangement , bbc world news america will be available to those stations without any commercials the bbc also said it would make new investments in the united states edition of its news web site , which would involve the hiring of an unknown number of video journalists in its washington bureau peter horrocks , the director of bbc global news , said in a statement friday making our news accessible to the widest possible audience is at the heart of the bbc and this new approach in the us gives audiences more opportunities to access the bbc s outstanding journalism across multiple platforms with a 24 7 news channel , a more widely available flagship newscast , and increased ondemand video created for the web , bbc news will meet current audience needs and adapt as they continue to evolve
elections routinely start with candidates' pledging more debates than they 'll ever really consent to , committing to a positivity that sours faster than unrefrigerated milk and promising to listen as much as they talk , a congenital impossibility for the 2012 presidential race , i 'd like them to make a different vow and actually keep it how about everyone s agreeing to shut up about their kids \? in its infancy \( pardon the term \) , this campaign season has already become excessively showy with exhibitionist parenting just last week president obama asserted that congressional republicans , playing brinkmanship with the deadline for raising the debt ceiling , should emulate his daughters , malia , 12 , and sasha , 10 the girls regularly finish their school assignments a day in advance or so their proud fingerwagging papa we await an andrew breitbart investigation into the claim the president s boast came hard on the heels of the first lady s southern africa tour , from which seemingly every picture and television clip had the girls on splashy display with the cameras rolling , they even from the cat in the hat , a little dr seuss for the savanna it was adorable , yes , and inspiring , sure , but also confusing , like their subsequent deployment as metaphors in the protracted budget showdown are the girls off limits , as the obamas have repeatedly \( and commendably \) \? or are they in play when the stakes are high , victory is uncertain , the president s frosty image could use some warming up and there s easy , convenient political theater to be had \? that s one of the problems with converting progeny into props it has a facile , cheap tinge at least the president shows more restraint than many of his republican challengers , who used the opening minutes of their presidential debate a few weeks ago to engage in a kind of reproductive arms race , each of them oneupping the other on the fecundity front rick santorum mentioned his seven children michele bachmann followed up by plugging her five children and her , making the latter sound like permanent charges rather than the temporary lodgers they were mitt romney ticked off five sons , five daughtersinlaw and , lest he let bachmann lap him , 16 grandchildren then ron paul outpaced them all instead of giving a count of his own kids \( five \) , he tallied roughly 4 , 000 lives that he , as a physician , had helped usher into the world go , babies , go jon huntsman was n't on hand , but a week later he answered his rivals' verbal ploys with a visual one he and his wife rounded up six of their seven children for an endless trek across a verdant lawn to the podium set up for his as the huntsmans marched in a photogenic phalanx , each step was like a mantra family man , family man , family man of course a big part of what all of these republican candidates are doing is trying to appeal to antiabortion voters but they and other politicians , including both the democratic and republican members of congress who brought up their offspring during last week s fiscal wrangling , are also sending the message that they can be trusted to whittle down the debt , shore up the country and otherwise safeguard the future precisely because they have a direct biological stake in it if they breed , they lead , or so their selfpromotion holds that s ludicrous progeny are n't proof of caring and farsightedness , qualities manifest in politicians who never procreated george washington , for example this founding father fathered none he nonetheless proved eminently capable of the long view how many children someone has says nothing about how well he or she will govern , and the tableaux of family bliss that candidates choreograph regularly prove to be fictions during the 2008 presidential election , which was unprecedentedly awash in little kids , john and elizabeth edwards made the most extravagant show of a tightly knit brood , , emma claire , then 9 , and jack , 7 , from the classroom to the campaign bus , a rolling romper room need i even finish this paragraph \? because so many politicians make such a studied pose out of their parenthood , it s fair to point out that jumping into the fray of a national campaign and hauling the clan into an unforgiving spotlight do n't necessarily do children any favors , especially if they 're young for all that candidates chatter about building a better tomorrow for their kids , they may be building a worse today it s funny how much things change not so long ago female candidates had to deflect charges that they 'd be distracted by the responsibilities of motherhood , or that they would be shirking them now they 're presented as paragons of multitasking ms bachmann and the democratic national committee chairwoman , , and of course sarah palin , who graduated from selfdescribed hockey mom to selfanointed mama grizzly she is mother , hear her roar but let s take a look at her cubs last week she joined the book tour of her daughter bristol , who previously sold the news of one of her two failed engagements to levi johnston to us magazine elected dancing with the stars over , say , a college education disappeared briefly to have surgery to reshape her jaw \( for medical reasons , she contends \) and will haul her and mr johnston s 2yearold son , tripp , into a reality television show , sure to be a profoundly formative experience for him tripp s welfare was no doubt foremost in her mind when she wrote the book , not afraid of life , which mr johnston and encourages the world and tripp to see him forevermore as who ended her virginity after feeding her so many wine coolers that she blacked out true or not , that s going to be an awfully heavy piece of baggage for their son to carry around and it s an awfully troubling example of palin family values having kids is n't the same as doing right by them , and candidates who seek credit for parenthood are also asking to be judged by the results that may be the best reason of all to keep them far from the trail
house republicans , led by speaker john a boehner , are introducing legislation that would repeal the landmark health care law that was passed last march do you think the law should be repealed \? why or why not \? in the article basic questions , elusive answers on health care law , david m herszenhorn and robert pear look at some of the murky issues surrounding the law and its possible repeal as the fight over health care returned to the house floor on tuesday , the debate could largely be stripped down to four questions that are relatively simple to ask , if not to answer will the health care law , approved last year by democrats with no republican support , increase or reduce future federal deficits \? will the law lead to the elimination of jobs by overburdened employers as republicans assert , or will it create jobs as democrats maintain \? will the law raise or lower the cost of medical care for individuals and families , employers , and state and federal governments \? and , will the law achieve president obama s goal of providing coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans \? given the complexity of the issues , none of these questions can yet be answered definitively more certain is the fate of the republicans bill to repeal the law , which contains 24 lines of legislative text and 38 lines of the names of the lawmakers sponsoring it while house republicans will vote to approve it on wednesday , the democratcontrolled senate is highly unlikely to act on it still , the assertions from the two sides highlight their radically different views about the proper role of government and market forces in the health care system it is a policy fight that is likely to rage for the next two years in congress and to figure prominently in the 2012 presidential campaign students tell us what you think about the health care law what do you know about it \? what are your impressions \? what questions do you have about it \? do you tend to support or oppose it \? do you want to see it repealed \? do you think it is likely to be repealed \? students 13 and older are invited to comment below please use only your first name for privacy policy reasons , we will not publish student comments that include a last name note we ask that adults respect the intent of the student opinion question and refrain from posting here there are many other places on nytimescom for adults to post , while this is the only place that explicitly invites the voices of young people please note our commenting guidelines
more than 1 , 500 miles from his home campus in altus , okla , a juniorcollege baseball coach might have seemed out of place recently at a rundown diamond in brooklyn but that is how he likes it there s never another coach out at these games , said the coach , kurt russell of western oklahoma state college i'm never competing against anyone russell had traveled to the boston area to visit his parents , then made a side trip to new york on a tip from one of his connections in the city a tall righthander with a 94mileperhour fastball had recently arrived from the dominican republic such connections and the players they unearth have allowed russell to build a baseball juggernaut in altus , continually replenishing a roster loaded with talented latino players from the northeast long a mediocre program , western oklahoma state has won at least 50 games and appeared in the national juniorcollege division ii world series each of the last four seasons , winning its first in june russell s baseball program has blossomed despite some initial hostility from the community some of its members were opposed to the college s awarding scholarships to athletes out of the area or out of the country , in some instances he capitalized on a quirk in the american collegiate baseball system that other junior colleges have exploited for years if a student accepts a baseball scholarship to an ncaa division i university , he cannot enter the major league baseball draft for three years if he attends a junior college , however , he does not forsake any eligibility and can enter the draft after one season but what makes russell s recruiting strategy different is the players he brings in often overlooked latinos looking for another chance to play this chance just happens to be in a remote part of oklahoma professional scouts no longer overlook western oklahoma state they are making the drive to altus and they usually like what they see in 2010 , western produced eight major league draft picks , more than oklahoma and oklahoma state , the state s most prominent division i programs we call this the dominican because this is our second home , said ramon lora , who immigrated to boston from the dominican republic in 1993 and later became instrumental in helping russell recruit latinos from the boston area he moved to altus in 2007 to become one of russell s two assistants and also works in maintenance at the college new coaches often talk about changing the culture it usually means little more than starting to win at western oklahoma state , russell was more radical altus , with a population less than 25 , 000 , lies seven miles from the texas border and 45 minutes from the closest city , lawton other than an air force base , there is little beyond a strip of businesses , restaurants and the college itself on main street nothing suggests it is a bastion of baseball for latinos russell was a middle infielder at western from 1993 to 1996 and played under bob pearson , who is now the athletic director originally from massachusetts , russell found his way to western when his father was stationed at altus air force base after his three years at western , he returned to massachusetts to coach high school baseball and kept in contact with his alma mater , recommending players and sending them there during his time as a player at western , russell roomed with some of the team s latino players , all of whom hailed from new york the group remained in contact over the years , and when he was hired in 2003 , russell reached out to his former teammates to serve as eyes and ears for possible recruits he first penetrated new york , then the boston area s hispanic baseball community , and from there ventured into philadelphia he makes annual trips to the areas , and after his years of success , players come out in droves for workouts when they hear russell is in town in his search for talent , he came across lora , who had run baseball academies in the dominican republic he would accompany russell , who does not speak spanish , in recruiting the program s first crop of players from the dominican republic , in 2005 under russell , have been as much as 90 percent latino he has extended his recruiting to venezuela , puerto rico , the virgin islands and cura ao western oklahoma state has an enrollment of about 1 , 500 students who take classes on campus according to the college s web site , the student body is 67 percent white and 16 percent hispanic russell and the coaching staff say the program s best recruiters are current and former players winning and word of mouth have also helped latino recruits from the northeast often have heard about the college s success and are interested in attending even before meeting russell whatever talent i see in new york , i just let him know , said manny paula , who was one of russell s first latino recruits at western and is the godfather of one of russell s children there are some good ones that have gone over there if i think a player is good enough and good for the program , i tell him to come and see the kid under national junior college athletic association rules , western oklahoma state , a division ii program , can grant 24 baseball scholarships that cover tuition , but not room and board \( division i juniorcollege scholarships cover tuition and room and board , and division iii junior colleges cannot grant any scholarships \) room and board at western is 1 , 875 a semester , and athletes occupy nearly all of the 96 beds available in campus housing tuition is 6250 a credit hour for residents and 19050 for nonresidents \( fees are extra \) the college has found relief from the scholarship restrictions most of the players russell recruits are from lowincome households and are eligible for federal pell grants , which not only cover room and board but also allow players to pocket the surplus sometimes hundreds of dollars the players use that extra money , however minimal , for living expenses through the academic year international players are not eligible for federal grants , but the njcaa allows colleges to grant 25 percent of their scholarships to international recruits for each team the players must pay for room and board there is no limit on the number of international players a team may have , but that will change next august when a new rule limits the total number of international players to 25 percent of the roster in all sports i would n't say it s a problem , but it s something that our schools and our membership does n't want to get carried away with , said mark krug , the assistant executive director of the njcaa there have been some instances of an entire team being made up of nonus citizen players in sports like soccer that is n't necessarily what our membership wants to see the players russell recruits tend to be overlooked and seeking another chance he is irked by an apparent stigma attached to junior colleges you hear a lot of success stories of kids going to fouryear schools after struggling with something , russell said but if he goes to a junior college , he s a screwup some , like andrelton simmons , are recruited out of the caribbean or have recently moved from the caribbean , where players not signed by age 17 are generally considered to have little professional potential russell went on a recruiting visit to cura ao in 2008 and heard about the scrawny simmons , who had quit baseball russell saw the 19yearold simmons play in sandals on a parking lot and offered him a scholarship on the spot two years later , in 2010 , simmons , a shortstop , was the atlanta braves' secondround draft pick others slip through the cracks at high schools and colleges in the united states such was the case with luis uribe , who went to division iii endicott college in massachusetts out of high school in brighton , mass after earning the conference s freshman of the year award , uribe transferred to western , where he hit 388 with 15 homers and 55 runs batted in one season uribe then accepted a scholarship to play at oklahoma state in his first season in stillwater , he was second on the team with a 355 average ruben sosa , who immigrated from the dominican republic when he was 12 , began his collegiate career at bunker hill community college in boston before he heard about western from a friend , jhiomar veras soon after an area scout notified russell of sosa , russell was in town to watch him work out after two seasons in altus , sosa was drafted in the 23rd round by the houston astros in june veras , an outfielder who immigrated to methuen , mass , from the dominican republic , was named the 2011 player of the year in division ii after leading the country with a 471 average and hitting 23 home runs with 84 rbi despite missing 17 games because of a hand injury the florida marlins drafted him in the 15th round coach russell made us feel like we were at home , sosa said the first time i met him , he told me he was going to build a man for society , he did n't want only a baseball player he wanted a real man that if baseball does n't work out for me , i can go out in the real world and have a job and be prepared it was n't only about baseball and he kept his word and everything came out just like he told me perhaps russell s most prominent player was overlooked for other reasons in 2007 , he brought the bronx native danny almonte to altus after a month of independent league baseball in illinois over two seasons , almonte , who received national scrutiny for playing in the little league world series while overage at 14 , was one the nation s best on the mound and at the plate almonte played the outfield and pitched , posting a 472 average with 14 home runs , 76 rbi and a 90 record on the mound in 2008 , his second and final season in altus and the first time the pioneers advanced to the world series despite almonte s success at western , pro scouts stayed away he was blackballed , russell said nobody wanted to give him a chance because of the negative publicity it would 've brought if he changed his name to danny gomez , he would 've been drafted in the first 10 rounds recruiting players of almonte s caliber is one thing persuading them to stay or keeping them academically eligible is another pearson , the athletic director , estimates that 80 percent to 90 percent of players move on to fouryear colleges if they do not sign to play professionally , but not every case is successful some players who did not deliver in the classroom have been sent home , russell and pearson said and because the team usually recruits more players than allowed on a roster , as many as 10 are cut each season russell said the players were allowed to stay at the college and coaches helped them in their effort to transfer if they wished to continue playing baseball at the collegiate level we push the academic side it s not about baseball , pearson said in an interview in his office you do n't go to class , you go home we 're trying to get these kids an education for a lot of these kids , it s an opportunity they never imagined possible to avoid losing players to academic problems , grades are checked every three weeks , and the college created an english as a second language program about four years ago with the baseball team in mind the program has been expanded to serve the community , which includes military families and many mexican immigrants although russell said that only two or three players had arrived on campus without knowing any english , international players and even some players from the united states who have not spent much time in the country are far from fluent or do not have adequate grammar skills pearson said before the esl program was put in place , players with language difficulties would have a tougher time in the classroom if they were recruited at all he said those players now usually redshirt their first year to catch up with the esl program and play the next two years the program is led by an english professor , rachel beckner , whom pearson described as the baseball program s mother hen she serves as an academic adviser and pseudocounselor for members of the team they are like sponges , said beckner , who has been a professor at western for eight years and has had players babysit for her children they are so hungry a lot of those kids are so familyoriented , and we treat them like family and it s like they do n't want to let people down we 're part of the family unlike in the ncaa , the juniorcollege association does not restrict how long teams can practice with coaches , and russell takes advantage the fall schedule includes waking up at 6 am and a 9 pm curfew with as many as three workouts or practices in the morning , afternoon and evening in addition to 10 fallseason games on weekends the curfew is later with just a couple of bars and a movie theater , altus offers few distractions to college students , so players often spend weekend nights in the batting cage once the season begins , in the spring , the routine is less demanding this is the perfect place , lora said for baseball , there s nothing better i'm telling you , i'm dominican , and we have all the bigtime academies none of those academies have what we got here i do n't even want people to know how we 're doing things here because we figured it out and it s something that can work for a long time in a predominately white area , the western oklahoma state baseball team has not always been embraced by the community or opponents' fans , russell said some community members complained about taxpayer dollars going to players from outside the area racial taunts were directed at the team at a regional tournament in kansas in 2009 , lora said i think the worst that i was able to see was when i went to one of the other guys' house for the weekend in a small town nearby and we went to watch his little sister s basketball game , said rob rodriguez , who played at western before signing with an independent team in new mexico this year as soon as we walked into this high school gym , everyone just got silent it felt like it was something out of a movie they just kind of stared and watched us walk all the way to our seats but as the program s profile has grown , the community seems to have warmed to the team players are recognized by residents in town because they attend games , or perhaps because the players look different the players go to the walmart down the street together to buy rice , chicken and plantains to make signature meals from home as part of their pregame routine , they sing songs in spanish with guaris and buckets used as drums fans took three greyhound buses for the threeandahalfhour trip to enid , okla , for western s five games in june s world series and , in a nod to the players , they banged on drums in the stands from when kurt took over and the amount of grief he took and double takes that people give over the ethnic makeup of the team to now , i mean we 're at the world series and there s grandmas up there banging on drums with noisemakers and this and that , said matt kruse , an assistant who attended western in 2000 and 2001 smalltown oklahoma people now love it people like being around a winner , i guess is what you can say at this point but there are still doubters out there but as soon as people are around our kids , they understand that these are special guys , and it s a pleasure to coach them , bottom line russell s approach has garnered more than just community acceptance now others are imitating it northern oklahoma collegetonkawa , a conference rival , has increased its recruiting efforts in new york , puerto rico and the virgin islands with success there s jealousy and envy , said northern oklahoma coach terry ballard , who estimated that more than a third of his roster last season was latino people were skeptical as to why they were going to that extent you can bring in four or five from out of state , but not that much his success has enamored everyone , in my opinion he decided to do it another way , and it s worked people were ticked off at first , but he s handled it with a graceful hand for now , russell still clearly enjoys being the only college coach in attendance at some games in the northeast that feature top latino players who are otherwise under the radar on a hot august day in brooklyn , russell seemed at ease he carried on conversations with players , coaches and family members of both teams many seemed to know about him and his program now that it s on the baseball map , western oklahoma is a soughtafter destination more than four hours later than he anticipated , russell finally got to see the dominican pitcher he was told about , edwar cruz and sure enough , the lean 20yearold was pumping 94mileanhour fastballs past flailing hitters cruz accepted an offer from russell on the spot and made his way to the prairie of southwest oklahoma for the start of classes in august only months removed from his departure from the dominican republic looks like this was worth it after all , russell said
marysville , calif matthew and tina quy did not look quite ready to part with their vintage stearman biplane as they showed it off here last weekend at an air show at beale air force base here its two open cockpits , its repaired fuselage and the wings they rebuilt from scratch working weekends in their onecar garage captain quy , 35 , of the air force , had wanted a stearman since he was a child and rushed to buy this plane when he found it , damaged from a crash but cheap , on ebay in 2005 six years later , after the quys spent much of their time and most of their savings on the stearman , it is a handvarnished gem that flies as beautifully as it looks it s more than just a plane , ms quy , 27 , said it is a piece of american history , one of the few surviving planes that were used to train the tuskegee airmen , the pioneering , allblack corps that served in the army during world war ii and the quys have agreed to turn over their plane at a ceremony this summer in washington to lonnie g bunch iii , the director of the smithsonian institution s new national museum of african american history and culture mr bunch plans to display the plane , he said , as a centrally important icon when the museum opens on the national mall in 2015 the second day of work i said i wanted a tuskegee plane , mr bunch said the smithsonian will give the quys a replacement fee so they can they can acquire , and fix up , another stearman with a less distinguished heritage the quys had no idea of the plane s importance when they bought it but a month later , captain quy \( rhymes with sky \) had an air force archivist track its history using its serial number the archivist called back with surprising news the plane had rolled off an assembly line on november 18 , 1944 , and had been delivered two days later to moton field in tuskegee , ala , where the airmen trained it was decommissioned in 1946 , after which it spent several decades as a crop duster before being acquired by a plane collector the quys , who are white , decided to name the plane spirit of tuskegee and fly it to air shows where they could teach people about the airmen and inspire children toward careers in the military or aviation for three years the couple has been raising money through the sale of spirit of tuskegee tshirts , which they use to pay the travel expenses of airmen who join them to speak about their wartime experiences this summer they will fly cross country , stopping in tuskegee , before landing in washington , where the plane will be transferred to the smithsonian during the tuskegee airmen s annual convention last weekend the quys were joined by one of the tuskegee armen at the base here where captain quy is stationed , a hour north of sacramento the airman , retired lt col james c warren , is a grizzled 87yearold former navigator , one of roughly 14 , 000 black men and women who served in some capacity at tuskegee , some as pilots , others as mechanics and nurses and in other jobs africanamericans had been generally barred from military aviation until 1941 when the government created the first black flying unit after lobbying by black leaders over the next five years 996 black pilots were trained at tuskegee many of them flew escort for bombing missions over north africa and italy where they earned a reputation for losing very few bombers to enemy fire colonel warren had just graduated from high school in illinois in 1942 when he read a magazine article about one of the first tuskegee pilots to graduate , charles debow it brought tears to my eyes , he said though he had never even been close to a plane before , he knew he wanted to fly the next summer he was in tuskegee for training , though he did not make the cut to be a pilot he ultimately joined the allblack 477th bombardment group , which was about to deploy to the pacific when the war ended he later served as a navigator on 173 combat missions in korea and vietnam , he said , before retiring in 1979 last weekend the quys and colonel warren greeted each other like old friends and captain quy rushed around to make sure the retired airman had everything he needed food , water , a place to sit out of the wind when colonel warren thanked him for his kindness , captain quy said , well , you took good care of us in world war ii and korea and vietnam still , for captain quy and colonel warren , the story of the tuskegee airmen holds a different emotional resonance , which suggests the challenges the africanamerican history museum will face as it tries to relate america s complex racial history to a variety of people captain quy speaks with reverence about the battles the airmen fought against segregation he recounted , for example , the story of an airman , alex jefferson , of detroit , whose family plotted his travel route to training in tuskegee , aware that if he stopped at the wrong gas station or restaurant , he could get beat up , or worse to go through that , and put your life on the line for your country is amazing , captain quy said the captain , though , who joined the service after 9 11 , speaks of discrimination in the military in the past tense today , being in the military with lots of minorities , you just do n't see race at all , he said all you care about is how good somebody is , especially if you 're going into combat with them racial tension does not seem as distant to colonel warren , who grew up picking cotton in alabama before moving north in the eighth grade to be a houseboy for an illinois family he said he felt the sting of discrimination , in the military and elsewhere , for decades , and is still distressed to find when he speaks to school groups that the students often sit segregated by race in one particularly dramatic incident during world war ii , he and more than 100 other black officers were arrested for entering an allwhite officers' club at an indiana air base and were ordered to face court martial most of them were later released , but they received an official reprimand , which stayed on their military records it killed my military career , basically , colonel warren said none of the men involved in the incident ever got above lieutenant colonel , he said after he published a book in 1995 , the tuskegee airmen mutiny at freeman field , and submitted some of the information he had gathered to the air force , his record was finally cleared his time at tuskegee , however , did imbue him with a lifelong love of aviation last september , more than 50 years after he was eliminated from primary training , he finally got his pilot s license he now keeps a plane at an airport near his home in vacaville , calif , and flies regularly i was very disappointed when i did n't become a pilot at that time , he said and it always hung with me
the newest university to open its doors in san francisco has no official curriculum , no accredited course work , no grades and no paid teachers in an age of escalating college costs , however , the which resides in the basement of viracocha , a store in the mission district has one very large thing going for it no tuition fees conceived by alan kaufman , 59 , a poet and former instructor at the academy of art university in san francisco , the free university is an ohsosan francisco experiment in divorcing education from commerce we do n't need walls , we do n't need desks to impart knowledge , mr kaufman said the idea of a free university is that it s monetarily free , free of constraints , free of any kind of administration the free university kicked off feb 5 with a weekend of lectures it was billed as a teachin , where local luminaries like diane di prima , the beat poet , and matt gonzalez , the former san francisco mayoral candidate , held forth on a number of subjects class titles like abolishing corporate personhood to create authentic democracy and restoring san francisco s urban wildlands drew hundreds of students on march 6 , the university will begin a cycle of seven fiveweek classes after that , mr kaufman said , students can expect both 5 and 10week courses another teachin is scheduled for june mr kaufman , who has long bridled against traditional education , came up with the idea for a free university in december with the encouragement of mr gonzalez , who is best known nationally as ralph nader s green party vicepresidential running mate , the project was born a loose collective of about 50 people is the institution s sole decisionmaking body mr kaufman is working on a plan that would expand the concept even further nine colleges within the university including a law school with mr gonzalez as dean and an art school headed by chuck sperry , a printmaker will be put to the collective for approval each school will have one female dean and one male dean to achieve gender parity call us crazies , san francisco crazies , but we 're doing it anyways , said mr kaufman , his brooklyn accent apparent even after 20 years of bay area residence we believe that we are a systemchanging revolution the makeshift school may be unusual but is hardly unique there s a long history of free universities in this country , and the bay area in particular , said john hurst , a professor emeritus at the university of california , berkeley but today s rising cost of higher education makes the project newly relevant according to the , a nonprofit research organization , the average california student holds about 17 , 000 in debt student debt totals nearly 1 trillion nationwide college tuition has increased 400 percent since the 1980s , a faster rate than that of escalating health care costs robert cohen , a professor of history and education at new york university , compared the free university to the freedom schools established in the south during the civil rights movement of the 1960s although then the issue was access more than cost this is a kind of response to commodification of knowledge , he said there s no free public higher education in california anymore the big question , of course , is how long the free university can remain in session with volunteer teachers mr hurst was n't hopeful about free university s longterm survival without any financial exchange the model has to be built on sustainability , he said none of the ones that have been freefree have served for very long would that they could sooner or later , people have to live still , students and teachers often interchangeable roles at the free university are hopeful i did n't know what to expect , admitted evan karp , a writer and web site founder along with andrew paul nelson , mr karp taught a class on friedrich nietzsche everyone was passionate , mr karp said of his students certainly , that was what i wanted out of a university experience that i did n't get even if the free university does n't last , its concept could spread once you show that there s a hunger for these kind of courses , maybe other institutions will pick up on it , mr cohen said , lawyers do pro bono work why ca n't universities \?
east rutherford , nj maybe this is how it begins for maybe their coronation begins on an overcast night , in front of a boisterous crowd , when all good sense says that they should have lost what emerged instead after 60 howdidthathappen minutes was yet another victory in the final seconds , a 2724 seasonopening win against the on sunday that added texture and resonance to their favorite catchphrase of last season to borrow words from bart scott , the jets ca n't wait for next week that is their next opportunity to back up their boasting , to resemble the contender their coach says they are , to tidy up some of the mistakes that forced them to roar back from a 2410 deficit in the fourth quarter afterward , coach strode to the lectern almost out of breath , blurting words like dogfight and bleak afterward , , pressured most of the night by the cowboys' relentless pass rush , appeared dazed , if not confused , as he savored a recordsetting comeback when nick folk drilled a 50yard field goal retaliation , perhaps , for his release by dallas two years ago the jets were 27 seconds away from becoming the first team to defeat the cowboys after trailing by at least 14 points in the fourth quarter now , according to the elias sports bureau , dallas is 24111 tonight , against the cowboys , i felt like i probably could have kicked it from 65 , folk said his estimation of that kick ran counter to the jets' mantra of the night just enough as in , safety jim leonhard had just enough speed to knock jason witten out of bounds at the 3 on a 64yard pass , preventing dallas from building a twotouchdown lead again three plays later , mike devito jarred the ball loose from tony romo , and sione pouha recovered the fumble as in , joe mcknight s fingers grazed just enough of mat mcbriar s punt to deflect it toward isaiah trufant , elevated from the practice squad on saturday , who danced 18 yards into the end zone for a gametying touchdown with five minutes left as in , the jets' defense confounded romo just enough on dallas s final possession for darrelle revis to intercept his pass , running it back 20 yards to get into folk s range we told our team , coach rex ryan said , whoever plays the hardest the longest wins this game the win echoed many of their cardiac victories of last season at detroit , at cleveland , against houston when things hit the fan , you lean to your experiences , linebacker bart scott said and experiences tell us around here that it s never over until the last tick the jets also learned from their experiences in last season s opener , also at home , in prime time and in front of a national television audience against a team with deep ties to ryan unlike in that game , when they sputtered in a loss to baltimore , the jets showed an opportunistic side sunday night as ryan won his fourth straight nfl game against his twin brother , rob , the cowboys' new defensive coordinator romo made a poor throw revis caught it the jets won it was a dumb decision , romo said of his pass , intended for dez bryant too reactionary on that gameturning moment , with the cowboys lining up at their 41 with a shade over a minute remaining , the defensive coordinator mike pettine called a play known as jet mike mix its intent is fooling the quarterback into seeing mantoman coverage when there is actually additional secondary help we disguised it as a blitz , we bluffed a blitz , we showed tony romo a blitz , revis said it was revis s first interception since january 2010 , coming on his son jayden s third birthday but on this night , there were more intriguing story lines , just enough to fill the lower bowl of metlife stadium , all of which played out against a somber backdrop , ceremonies commemorating the 10th anniversary of the sept 11 terrorist attacks besides the ninth edition of the ryan bowl , there was the unveiling of the pivotal third season of sanchez , who committed two crucial mistakes a lost fumble and an interception but showed great poise in the face of a swarming defense and completed 26 of 44 passes for 335 yards i'm good , i'm all right , sanchez said it was a rough game some games , you get knocked around a little bit there was also an attimes shaky performance by a defense that returned 10 of 11 starters , that was shredded by romo for 342 yards , but still bailed out the jets once more we never apologize for a win , but we 've got a lot of work to do , scott said there was also the debut of plaxico burress , playing his first regularseason game since nov 23 , 2008 invisible through three quarters , burress turned around bryan mccann , a thirdstring cornerback , to snag a 26yard touchdown pass he finished with four catches for 72 yards if all of rex ryan s dreams involve hoisting the vince lombardi trophy , reveling beneath a confetti shower , then his nightmares resemble something out of the jets' first two series his vaunted defense allowed a coldsweatinducing moment on a 42yard catchandrun by bryant , who had lined up in the slot against linebacker bryan thomas it was a severe mismatch , though no one on the jets seemed able to handle bryant , fast and tall and physical not antonio cromartie , whom bryant overpowered in the back corner for a 3yard touchdown , and not even revis , who later in the quarter was beaten along the right sideline for a 26yard gain on one play but one only bryant had turned revis island into his own private paradise the cowboys' version of revis a gamechanger is demarcus ware , a snarling defensive end who practically has his mail forwarded into opponents' backfields on the jets' first offensive play , ware manhandled wayne hunter , the jets' new starter at right tackle , and blasted sanchez for a sack , supplying the opening flourish on a threeandout it looked bleak , ryan said , there s no question about it the jets rotated personnel adding another tight end , for instance to help with containing ware , who found no obstacle too big once , he zipped past d'brickashaw ferguson , the jets' pro bowl left tackle there s not many of them in the league , hunter said of ware it s all upside from here when sanchez had time to throw , he was accurate , completing his first five passes but too often he did not have time to throw , to go over his progressions , rendering the jets' new bigplay threats burress and derrick mason a mirage sanchez looked their way twice in the first half , misfiring each time what kept the jets close in the first half was their defense , which settled in after the ugly opening possession to yield only a field goal , a 34yarder by dan bailey taking over at their 22 , the jets marched downfield with efficiency and precision , as sanchez connected with his underneath receivers an improved aspect of his development , coaches say a 32yard screen to ladainian tomlinson was bookended by two catches by sanchez s reliable target , tight end dustin keller , who hauled in a 4yard touchdown in the back of the end zone to cut the cowboys' lead to 107 with 37 seconds remaining in the first half any momentum the jets hoped to retain after halftime was thwarted by an ineffective possession , and the cowboys pounded away with short gain after short gain , riding a thirddown conversion catch by kevin ogletree against revis , before again testing cromartie romo s pass , a bit underthrown , landed in cromartie s hands it also landed in the hands of miles austin , who ripped the ball away for a 36yard touchdown through three quarters , the jets had no penalties \( they finished with none \) through three quarters , they had no turnovers either or at least they had none until sanchez dropped back to pass , the final seconds ticking off unhurried and untouched , sanchez looked over the middle for keller and made a perfect pass to sean lee , the cowboys' linebacker , who rumbled 37 yards before being pushed out inside the jets' 1 two plays later , felix jones jogged in , extending the cowboys' lead to 2410 as the jets retreated to their sideline , frustrated but unbowed , primed for a comeback that s the beauty of the nfl it does n't have to be pretty , leonhard said you 've just got to somehow manage to get wins
mayor s farewell speech to the economic club of chicago last week was an oversubscribed event necessitating an adjoining ballroom at the hilton chicago there were 2 , 000 attendees , but just two print reporters and one tv crew the news media s definition of irrelevance is as expansive as its attention span is short why check out a lame duck s babbling to men in tuxedos and women in evening dresses when you can fall over one another covering his wannabe successors' staged events and sideshows replete with cries of judas ! \? the king of bigcity mayors offered a primer on his era with his seemingly inarticulate , yet inimitably effective means of communication it made me recall the joni mitchell lyric do n't it always seem to go , that you do n't know what you 've got till it s gone mr daley started by reading a wellcrafted opening to a 1981 chicago tribune series , city on the brink , by an estimable reporter , r c longworth the city of chicago has become an economic invalid the condition may be permanent unless the people responsible for its economic future can reverse the long , steady and seemingly endless slide chicago is losing the industry that was its original reason for existing and has found nothing to replace it often , cities stricken in this way become irrelevant business moves away so do the best young people the population ages the city becomes a backwater that s not what happened , said mr daley , detailing the city s history of reinvention , which makes relevant mark twain s 1883 comment that , it is hopeless for the occasional visitor to try to keep up with chicago she outgrows his prophecies faster than he can make them as mr daley exits , chicago is , by some ratings , the fifth or sixth most important city globally huge problems persist , including crumbling infrastructure , awful poverty and persistent segregation but over all , it s been a remarkable run and partly explains why a white house chief of staff departed to seek an office in city hall the mayor , an everpassionate 68 , detailed some of the successes , citing groupon as one of many firms whose rise was both unpredictable and a function of a premeditated probusiness environment groupon was bolstered by city help with taxes and a dazzling renovation of the old montgomery ward catalog house you ca n't amble around groupon s vibrant headquarters , with its army of wearing 20 and 30somethings , and not appreciate mr daley s assertion that talented people can live anywhere and capital can move anywhere the trick is luring and keeping them he wound up his formal address by mentioning the recent visit of president hu jintao of china as an exclamation point on chicago s rise mr hu came because of the aggressive insertion of chinese language study into local school curricula and the perception the city is a gateway to the midwest economy mr daley thanked the business community profusely , received a standing ovation , then engaged in a revealing chat with john rogers jr , chairman of ariel investments , mr daley s onetime park district board president and cochair of president obama s inaugural committee as usual , there was a streamofconsciousness element in the mayor s language , with verbsubject agreement sometimes thrown to the wind but one realized , too , how weirdly effective a communicator he is whether the subject is the need for diversity in hiring , the reshaping of public housing or his attitude toward government washington is not part of america it s bureaucracy , said the man who mastered the bureaucracy , regardless of which party was in charge i 'd love not to balance my budget as a friend noted , one heard a famous bigcity democratic mayor who is a small c' conservative he s emphatic about government limits and privatesector centrality , but passionate about education , havenots , transit , the environment and gun control how can we tell others how to live when we 're killing our own \? mr daley asked melding those core values with strong relations with business was no small feat it s why the next mayor none of the candidates were present should get the speech as for what s next , he s fielding opportunities but one vague prospect looms new uncertainty on our roadways since he was elected cook county state s attorney 30 years ago , the guy has n't driven it will be a shock to everybody , he said
and its allied movements around the country are more than a walk in the park they are most likely the start of a new era in america historians have noted that american politics moves in long swings we are at the end of the 30year reagan era , a period that has culminated in soaring income for the top 1 percent and crushing unemployment or income stagnation for much of the rest the overarching challenge of the coming years is to restore prosperity and power for the 99 percent thirty years ago , a newly elected ronald reagan made a fateful judgment government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem taxes for the rich were slashed , as were outlays on public services and investments as a share of national income only the military and a few big transfer programs like , , and veterans' benefits were exempted from the squeeze reagan s was a fateful misdiagnosis he completely overlooked the real issue the rise of global competition in the information age and fought a bogeyman , the government decades on , america pays the price of that misdiagnosis , with a nation singularly unprepared to face the global economic , energy and environmental challenges of our time washington still channels reaganomics the for nonsecurity discretionary outlays categories like highways and rail , education , job training , research and development , the judiciary , nasa , environmental protection , energy , the irs and more was cut from more than 5 percent of at the end of the 1970s to around half of that today with the budget caps enacted in the august agreement , domestic discretionary spending would decline to less than 2 percent of gdp by the end of the decade , according to the white house government would die by fiscal asphyxiation both parties have joined in crippling the government in response to the demands of their wealthy campaign contributors , who above all else insist on keeping low tax rates on capital gains , top incomes , estates and corporate profits corporate taxes as a share of national income are at the lowest levels in recent history rich households take home the greatest share of income since twice before in american history , powerful corporate interests dominated washington and brought america to a state of unacceptable inequality , instability and corruption both times a social and political movement arose to restore democracy and shared prosperity the first age of inequality was the gilded age at the end of the 19th century , an era quite like today , when both political parties served the interests of the corporate robber barons the progressive movement arose after the financial crisis of 1893 in the following decades theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson came to power , and the movement pushed through a remarkable era of reform trust busting , federal income taxation , fair labor standards , the direct election of senators and women s suffrage the second gilded age was the roaring twenties the probusiness administrations of harding , coolidge and hoover once again opened up the floodgates of corruption and financial excess , this time culminating in the great depression and once again the pendulum swung fdr s new deal marked the start of several decades of reduced , strong trade unions , steep top tax rates and strict after 1981 , reagan began to dismantle each of these core features of the new deal following our recent financial calamity , a third progressive era is likely to be in the making this one should aim for three things the first is a revival of crucial public services , especially education , training , public investment and environmental protection the second is the end of a climate of impunity that encouraged nearly every wall street firm to commit financial fraud the third is to reestablish the supremacy of people votes over dollar votes in washington none of this will be easy vested interests are deeply entrenched , even as wall street titans are jailed and their firms pay megafines for fraud the progressive era took 20 years to correct abuses of the gilded age the new deal struggled for a decade to overcome the great depression , and the expansion of economic justice lasted through the 1960s the new wave of reform is but a few months old the young people in zuccotti park and more than 1 , 000 cities have started america on a path to renewal the movement , still in its first days , will have to expand in several strategic ways activists are needed among shareholders , consumers and students to hold corporations and politicians to account shareholders , for example , should pressure companies to get out of politics consumers should take their money and purchasing power away from companies that confuse business and political power the whole range of other actions shareholder and consumer activism , policy formulation , and running of candidates will not happen in the park the new movement also needs to build a public policy platform the american people have it absolutely right on the three main points of a new agenda to put it simply tax the rich , end the wars and restore honest and effective government for all finally , the new progressive era will need a fresh and gutsy generation of candidates to seek election victories not through wealthy campaign financiers but through free social media a new generation of politicians will prove that they can win on youtube , twitter , facebook and blog sites , rather than with corporatefinanced tv ads by lowering the cost of political campaigning , the free social media can liberate washington from the current state of endemic corruption and the candidates that turn down large campaign checks , political action committees , super pacs and bundlers will be well positioned to call out their opponents who are on the corporate take those who think that the cold weather will end the protests should think again a new generation of leaders is just getting started the new progressive age has begun

jakarta , indonesia the gruesome video is as disturbing for what is n't happening as much as for what is hundreds of muslim villagers carrying machetes and sticks march on a house where about 20 members of , a minority muslim sect , are holed up roof tiles plunge and windows shatter in a hail of rocks until the villagers swarm into the house those not lucky enough to escape are brought outside , stripped and beaten as the crowd surges , villagers stomp on the apparently lifeless bodies of several men the video , shot on sunday , shows outnumbered police officers simply looking on during the violence , with a few desultory attempts at intervention though three ahmadis , members of the ahmadiyya sect , were killed and half a dozen were wounded , the crowd dispersed and no arrests were made the violence , in a village in banten province west of jakarta , is the latest and bloodiest episode in what human rights advocates say is a rising tide of oppression against the sect , which originated in south asia the group has been denounced as deviant by s top clerics and subject to a government decree restricting its activities it is spurned by some mainstream muslims who view its founder , mirza ghulam ahmad , as a heretic for claiming he was a prophet advocates say the attack , in full view of the authorities , is a clear sign that the government of president susilo bambang yudhoyono is turning a blind eye to mob violence against a range of religious minorities , including christians , that is being stoked by a vocal islamist fringe the police have done nothing from the beginning , said bonar tigor naipospos , the vice chairman of the , a jakarta organization that promotes religious tolerance no preventative action from police , not just yesterday , but in every case related with religious conflict there were 50 episodes of religious oppression against ahmadis in 2010 , up from 33 in 2009 and 15 in 2008 , the setara institute said responding to pressure from hardliners to disband ahmadiyya , mr yudhoyono s government passed a compromise decree in 2008 banning ahmadis from proselytizing the government says the ban is essential for averting conflict , but liberals say it provides a pretext for further violence conservatives , including the religious affairs minister , suryadharma ali , have argued that the government should go further and break up ahmadiyya officials condemned sunday s attack and pledged to crack down on those behind it on monday , mr yudhoyono ordered a special investigation and called for harsh punishment for those involved , including any government officials or police officers found to be negligent a spokesman for the national police , col boy rafli amar , said the police had done everything in their power to prevent violence between villagers and ahmadis , which had been simmering for days but when villagers suddenly charged the home of a local ahmadi leader , he said , the police were surprised and outnumbered eight people were taken in for questioning but none has so far been declared a suspect , he said there were efforts , but it was just that there were n't enough police to balance out the community this village is far away , isolated , in the interior , colonel amar said firdaus mubarik , a spokesman for ahmadiyya in jakarta , said the police are tolerating violence against ahmadis and christians as part of a broader approach by mr yudhoyono of refusing to fight islamic extremists , who are a slim but vocal minority in indonesian politics i believe sby knows what s happening to ahmadiyya and he s letting it happen , mr mubarik said , referring to the president by his initials to back his assertion that the sunday attack was coordinated and premeditated , mr mubarik said that at one point in the video , an attacker notices he is being filmed and turns to the camera pressing his palms together in a position of prayer , he looks at the camera and offers a wide smile

' mr abu alkhair said he knew about many women who drove , and aside from one being questioned by the police for two hours , none were bothered once the campaign had been announced there were frequent threats by opponents to punish female drivers either by beating them or by smashing their cars we want women to keep fighting this fight and to be free , he said it will help to liberate the entire society in the weeks after ms sharif s arrest , a debate erupted between conservative clerics and their followers and the kingdom s increasingly outspoken women opponents largely argued that saudi society was not ready , that a woman should not be thrown into the wilds of saudi driving habits or be held responsible for any accidents worse , opponents argued , it would lead to the public mingling of the sexes supporters mocked the clerics for putting everything in a sexual context and asked why it was ok for saudi women to be driven around by an army of some 800 , 000 male drivers imported from southeast asia although the arrest of ms sharif discouraged women from driving , the fact that it enlivened the debate was in contrast to the first \( and last \) such protest in november 1990 clerics branded the 47 women amoral and the royal family confiscated their passports , firing those working for the government many went into isolation for their own safety in addition to religious opposition there is widespread suspicion in the country that those who control the visa process and in saudi arabia that means the princes of the ruling family have made a business out of controlling the black market in visas for drivers , which can cost more than 3 , 000 apiece many young married women decry the fact that they cannot afford that , not to mention the driver s salary , about 600 a month the more liberal princes support allowing women to drive prince talal bin abdulaziz alsaud , 79 years old and long among the most outspoken members of the royal family , argues that such reforms lag because the leading members of the family have failed to yield any power or influence to younger generations bravo to the women ! the prince said in an interview why should women drive in the countryside and not in the cities \? \( women have long driven in rural areas \) king abdullah and other royals have said in interviews with foreign reporters that they expected saudi women to drive one day soon but have done little lately saudi arabian women are going to have to fight for our rights , men are not going to just hand them over to us , said amira kashgary , a professor who drove through jidda on friday for 45 minutes with her 21yearold daughter women are tired of being stranded or missing appointments because their drivers disappear for the day , professor kashgary said we want to drive today , tomorrow , and every day it s not a oneday show we want to make it a norm

galibier serrechevalier , france andy schleck of luxembourg charged uphill , ahead , exhausted and alone attacking imposing ascents in the alps , he made a move with about 37 miles left in to speed ahead of the other contenders when the course was at its most unmerciful and to break alberto contador , the twotime defending champion who is usually the one abusing the competition in the mountains schleck s audacious gamble paid off seemingly powered by something other than his skinny , shaved legs and a bike , he won the stage and vaulted into second place in the overall standings , putting himself in position to take over the lead friday if he can set the pace again through the final mountain stage calling it the best victory of his career , schleck effectively knocked contador out of contention for the title three days before the ceremonial ride into paris i went out this morning and i told myself , no guts , no glory , schleck said afterward , compiling an impressive three clich s in answering one question i took the race by the horns i was all in on the road to the finish here , one lined with flags and signs and fans , a message painted in large black letters forecast what lay ahead time to dance , it read ultimately , a race day that had been billed as potentially epic and certainly pivotal rearranged the top of the standings schleck leapt over his brother , frank , who remained in third place but lost more than two minutes to his younger sibling and leopard trek teammate in the stage cadel evans of australia , once second , fell to fourth , but remained in contention at one point , andy schleck powered more than four minutes ahead of the other favorites , but several closed the gap later in the stage none appeared to take more pain in doing so than the frenchman thomas voeckler , who churned up the famous col du galibier toward the highest stage finish in tour history at roughly 8 , 700 feet , his face twisted into the definition of exhaustion for another day , voeckler defended the yellow jersey he has long guaranteed that he will lose , although he still had a 15second over all lead when stage 18 ended after kissing a baby at the finish , he promised to attempt another improbable defense friday , as the race again crosses the col du galibier and ends after the switchbacks at the famed alpe d'huez this is a triumph that i fought for with all my strength , said voeckler , who would be the first french winner at the tour in 26 years i will see what i can do but for now , the only thing i want to do is rest late wednesday , at the team hotel in italy , the trainer luca guercilena insisted that the schleck brothers were positioned to contend they performed better , he said , in longer races , and the crux of their strategy hinged on thursday and friday s stages in the mountains brian nygaard , the team s general manager , even hinted that a move was coming leopard trek planned for one brother to take control , he said but he remained coy about which one would over the previous week , nygaard acknowledged that criticism had mounted the schlecks' strategy had at times seemed confounding , with both brothers near the top of the leader board but neither atop it , with the race nearing its conclusion and frank ahead of andy , when the opposite was expected for those who implored leopard trek to make a decision on which brother would be pushed toward the podium at the other s expense , nygaard said it already had they know exactly when that moment is , he said they will do it , and they will do it gladly they also needed to do it soon because while stage 19 presents another potentially decisive trek into the mountains , stage 20 is an individual time trial the schlecks are almost certain to cede ground to evans , a superior time trialist members of team leopard trek hoped for at least a twominute cushion by the end of stage 19 evans finished thursday s stage 57 seconds behind andy schleck in the overall standings , and he expended more energy than he hoped to late in the stage with roughly eight miles remaining , evans continued to wait for someone to help him attack , to cut into schleck s advantage , which was growing when no one did , evans took it upon himself , pacing the other favorites at his own expense he managed to close the deficit , but so did frank schleck and voeckler speaking of fatigue , it remains to be seen how andy schleck will recover from his own mad dash thursday to that end , guercilena said wednesday , schleck recovers as well or better than anyone i 've ever worked with schleck had launched the attack surprisingly early , halfway through the second climb , on the col d'izoard by 3 55 pm local time , schleck led voeckler by nearly two minutes from there , the gap continued to widen , but it seemed unlikely that schleck could endure by himself for so long the last time a tour contender made such an early , brazen and successful move in a stage was in 2006 , when the american floyd landis set out on an astonishing , implausible 77mile attack over a series of alpine passes that positioned him for an eventual tour victory landis went from 11th place to third place , winning the stage by nearly six minutes christian prudhomme , the tour director , said he had not seen a move that courageous in 20 years others , including the former and longtime tour director jeanmarie leblanc , said it was the best tour stage they had ever seen but the praise for landis s seemingly miraculous feat did not last for long he won the tour , but soon learned that he had tested positive for a banned synthetic form of testosterone after that alpine stage he eventually was stripped of the tour victory , becoming the first tour winner to lose the title for doping , and was barred from the sport for two years on thursday , many observers expected contador to attack for separation on the col d'izoard the manager of his saxo banksungard team , bjarne riis , said wednesday that if contador had any hope of closing his deficit of more than three minutes , he needed to attack everybody contador said it would depend on the wind instead , contador s strange tour continued as the defending champion and a threetime winner , he entered as the overwhelming favorite but through a combination of bad luck and multiple crashes , which led to a sore right knee , he lurked near the back of the contenders , attacking occasionally , but not in true contador form with roughly 22 miles remaining thursday , contador stopped briefly to change bikes he pushed his way back among the contenders , only to fade again , his tour chances all but evaporating in the mountains , where he usually dominates for contador , the 2011 tour appears over , but the race itself is not , not by a long shot cyclists first crossed the col du galibier in 1911 , and to mark the centennial , it will be featured again in stage 19 friday s climbs will be nearly as brutal as thursday s , and the favorites are likely to gain more separation , as they ascend galibier before navigating the 22 tricky turns at alpe d'huez for the remaining favorites like evans and the schleck brothers , stage 19 will be especially critical , with the time trial looming and the top four still bunched relatively close together second over all is the perfect position to go into tomorrow , andy schleck said
this month marks the publication of bumbleardy , the first book that maurice sendak has written and illustrated in 30 years mr sendak has been promoting the new book largely from his home in connecticut i spoke with him by phone in june , on the day before his 83rd birthday we talked about bumbleardy , the trouble with some children s literature and which among his own books is his favorite below , condensed and edited , are excerpts from that conversation the new york times what inspired your return to writing \? mr sendak there hasn t been a stopping point it just takes me longer because i m older the book that s coming out in september has been two or three years in the making i m working on another book right now what do you think differentiates your work from other children s books out there \? that s a difficult question but i don t see that many books i haven t kept abreast i live deep in the country with books today , i m not always sure if they re truthful or faithful to what s going on with children if you look at the work of tomi ungerer , it s passionate , it s personal , it s marvelous and it s cuckoo , and it s that s kind of veracity that s always made for good children s literature if there s anything missing that i ve observed over the decades it s that that drive has declined there s a certain passivity , a going back to childhood innocence that i never quite believed in we remembered childhood as a very passionate , upsetting , silly , comic business i teach i stress character , character , character and for authors to go where you want go where you will children will go everywhere when your work first appeared , it was considered to be new , something different what were you doing that nobody else had done \? i was developing a child who i recognized as myself as a child , from my observations of other children around me in brooklyn we were wild creatures we did things that were objectionable max , to me , was a very average normal kid , but he upset a lot of people at the time he yelled at his mother , he talked back to her , she deprived him of food and then gave it to him children who fight back , children who are full of excitement are the kind of children i like max was a little beast , and we re all little beasts that was what was so novel some of your books have been controversial why do you think that s so \? it has always seemed kind of foolish to me everything that was happening in my work was happening in my life i recorded what was important to me outside over there was and is my particular favorite because it had so much to do with my sister and the awfulness of her having to take care of me she pushed me and pulled me i loved her and i hated her there was nothing in her that made me think girls weren t as capable of anger the way boys were we all did the most outlandish things , some of which we told our parents , most of which we did not we were all keenly aware that parents were scaredy cats you mustn t scare parents and i think with my books , i managed to scare parents randolph caldecott was a sneaky guy because under the guise of stories about little animals , he had the same passion for childhood if you just look at the surface of them , they look like nice english books for kiddies but his books are troubling if you spend time with them he inspired me i adored caldecott probably his idea , or my interpretation of him , was that children s books should be fair to children not to soften or to weaken before that , the attitude towards children was keep them calm , keep them happy , keep them snug and safe it s not a putdown of those earlier books but basically , they went by the rules that children should be safe and that we adults should be their guardians i got out of that , and i was considered outlandish so be it did you think earlier children s books underestimate children \? misread them \? i think they were trying to find out what a children s book was what was a children s book \? a very famous one is alice in wonderland it s a terrifying book it s a nightmare that to me comes as close to the world of childhood as great books do carroll was allowing for nightmare , murderous impulses i don t know why he got away from it he told the truth about childhood , about how unsafe it was essentially , there is no protecting children none i grew up at a tough time with the lindbergh baby kidnapping there was this invasion of childhood in the air in my neighborhood , a little girl died no mention was made of it we children had to meet in the backyard to imagine what it meant what s happened to rita \? it was a world that darkened the holocaust demolished my family , my parents i saw that , i was there , i was a child i had to bear it even though i didn t have any idea what it meant what language was there to tell a child \? none that has stayed with me all my life i was very much afraid when i was a child but all my books end safely i needed the security in my soul of bringing these children back ida comes back safe max finds his meal waiting for him it means his mother loves him the rough patches between them are solved mickey gets safely back in bed we want them to end up ok , and they do end up ok unlike grownup books i wouldn t write a grownup book if my life depended on it we are touching a touchy subject from the basis of our conversation , i would say that touch of reality in a child s life is a child s comfort the child gets the sense that this person who wrote this book knows about me and knows the world can be a troubling , incomprehensible place i have never had a letter from a child that said , go to hell they are always thanking me for opening the door , even if it was only peeking through to show how difficult life could be what i do as best i can is out of a deep respect for children , for how difficult their world is yes , there have to be places for safe wonderful stories it s a big world it s a big profession but there should still be crazy people like me and tomi left tell me about your friendship with tomi ungerer mr ungerer was visiting the united states then for the first time in years he and mr sendak eventually saw each other the following week we all went to ursula nordstrom , a legendary children s book editor at what was then harper brothers and ursula adored him i was quite jealous at the time , there were all kinds of technical things that children s illustrators had to do now all those steps have been totally eliminated but back then , i could teach him a couple of things , and it was a joy to help him to spend time with a light box and crayons and show him how to prepare books for the printer i was enough a part of his life that he knew i was a faithful friend , and a keen friend for what he did his was a ferocious honesty a colossal sense of comedy , fun , humor delicious pictures his colors are so yummy , yummy yummy delicious , tantalizingly rich he s one of the most wonderful people in the world his work was almost too much for america at that time nothing about what tomi does seems out of keeping with what s going on in the universe right now the world is twice as crazy as it s ever been i ll be 83 tomorrow , and i ve never known conditions in the world to be so frightening and topsyturvy what have we done to the weather \? how do you explain that to the children \? what books did you read as a child \? there was no such thing as children s books you just began reading when you read tom sawyer and huck finn that was children s books back then and i passionately loved comic books little books that you just wanted to eat like a sandwich mickey mouse and pygmyland , a takeoff of gulliver s travels i read it a million times buck rogers books i do not remember any proper children s books in my childhood i was not exposed to them we had to read terrible things like arrowsmith , the books teachers exposed us to in school it seems to me that most children s books came along with the end of world war ii the doors opened to people like me who were undereducated at that time , i could go into ursula s office and show my wares she said to me our first meeting you ll do a book now you need an agent all she did was say , draw and if you were good , you got a second book oh , god do i miss her ! i believed in her bumbleardy comes out of all the things we ve just talked about he runs against the grain of what s considered a proper childhood thank god , we have grown up
until friday , most of us could have been forgiven for thinking nothing significant could possibly be happening beyond the catastrophic shores of japan but after weeks of mounting crisis over libya , and accusations of dithering on the part of the obama administration as col muammar elqaddafi s forces continued to take control of key cities along the libyan coast , the week s end brought a flurry of the highest level diplomatic maneuvers , resolutions and demands the times pulled it all together  washington president obama ordered colonel muammar elqaddafi on friday to implement a ceasefire immediately and stop all attacks on libyan civilians or face military action from the united states and its allies in europe and the arab world in one of the most forceful statements he has issued from the white house mr obama said that his demands were not negotiable colonel qaddafi had to pull his forces back from major cities in libya or the united states and its allies would stop him the president said that he was forced to act because colonel qaddafi had turned on his own people and had shown , mr obama said , no mercy on his own citizens the president said that with the passage on thursday night of a united nations security council resolution authorizing military action against colonel qadaffi to protect libyan civilians , the united states would not act alone , and in fact that france , britain and arab nations would take the lead that is the clear desire of the pentagon , which has been strongly resistant to another american war in the middle east mr obama said flatly that american ground forces would not enter libya muammar qaddafi has a choice , he said the united states , the united kingdom , france and arab states agree that a ceasefire must be implemented immediately that means all attacks against civilians must stop a visceral response from andrew sullivan at the daily dish soon followed the president s speech was disturbingly empty there are , it appears , only two reasons the us is going to war , without any congressional vote , or any real public debate the first is that the us cannot stand idly by while atrocities take place yet we have done nothing in burma or the congo and are actively supporting governments in yemen and bahrain that are doing almost exactly if less noisily what qaddafi is doing obama made no attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies because , one suspects , there is no rational reconciliation to be made secondly , the president argued that the ghastly violence in libya is destabilizing the region , and threatening world peace really \? more than qaddafi s meddling throughout africa for years \? more than the brutal repression in iran \? and even if it is destabilizing , libya is not , according to the obama administration itself , a vital national interest so why should the us go to war over this \? none of this makes any sense , except as an emotional response to an emergency i understand the emotions , and sympathize with the impulse to help but i can think of no worse basis for committing a country to war than such emotional and moral anxiety ezra klein at the washington post struck a quieter , but similar note in his response to the speech i didn t find president obama s remarks on libya comforting the point of the speech , as i understood it , was both to announce that we were engaging but also assure america that our engagement was going to be limited but consider the promises made the united states is not going to deploy ground troops into libya and we are not going to use force to go beyond a welldefined goal , specifically the protection of civilians in libya those two sentences are at war with each other protecting civilians might well require more than bombing runways if gaddafi is deposed and the state collapses into tribal warfare , does our pledge to resist ground troops trump our pledge to protect civilians \? or will it be the other way around \? even though he does not oppose military intervention in libya outright , klein can t get his head around the justification for a possible war the easy response to this is to ask how i can be so diffident in the face of slaughter but consider obama s remarks left unchecked , he said , we have every reason to believe that gaddafi would commit atrocities against his people many thousands could die every year , one million people die from malaria about three million children die , either directly or indirectly , due to hunger there is much we could due to help the world if we were willing the question that needs to be asked is why this \? at the new republic , jonathan chait , in a post titled the libya question is only about libya , takes the objections of both klein and sullivan head on why intervene in libya and not elsewhere is a question that needs to be asked but it s not a question that needs to be asked to determine the wisdom of intervening in libya should we also spend more money to prevent malaria \? yes , we should but i see zero reason to believe that not intervening in libya would lead to an increase in in american assistance to prevent malaria why not intervene in burma or yemen or elsewhere \? i would say the answer is prudential for various political , geographic , and military reasons , the united states has the chance to prevent slaughter in libya at reasonable cost , and does not have the chance to do so in burma max boot , a senior fellow with the council on foreign relations , who had been urging obama to action during the week , felt that the president s speech had left out one important condition that qaddafi must go  in his public statement today obama sounded resolute but he also set out fairly narrow goals and did not reiterate his previous call for qaddafi s ouster qaddafi has said he is imposing a ceasefire what if his forces pull back from eastern libya \? does that mean we won t impose a nofly zone or mount air strikes \? if so that would leave qaddafi in control of a substantial part of the country where he could continue the human rights abuses that are rightly condemned by the united nations and could force the us to undertake a lengthy and costly military involvement to make sure that qaddafi stands by his promises not to march into benghazi much simpler and surer to do everything possible , short of dispatching ground troops , to topple qaddafi i have previously noted that such steps would include a nofly zone combined with air strikes on qaddafi s ground forces and also training and arms for the rebel forces that represents a substantial commitment on our part , and comes with attendant risks no doubt there is still a faction in the administration hoping that a few symbolic moves will be enough to get qaddafi to cease and desist but our goal should not be simply a temporary cessation of the violence a lasting solution requires qaddafi to be gone , and that won t be easy to achieve we may have a real fight on our hands i only hope that the administration is ready for that in a post before the president s speech , adam serwer at the plum line pointed up another wild card the libyan rebels the problem is that we still don t know very much about who the rebels are or what they ultimately want libya s internal politics were opaque to the west even before the war we don t know how much international involvement will be required to ensure gaddafi falls , or what level of commitment the united states , as the world s only superpower , will ultimately be forced to make in other words , none of the key questions looming over the crisis have been answered even though we ve already learned the hard way in iraq what happens when we fail to plan for the peace before we start a war all we really know right now is that america is destined to own the outcome in libya doug mataconis in a brief post at outside the beltway asks a good question if this is for real , then one wonders if gaddafi hasn t just called the world s bluff if he puts a ceasefire in place and complies with it , then what justification is there for any military action against his regime \? at the guardian , simon tisdall has similar reservations about the current standoff it s plain that whichever way the stated aims of the intervention are defined , achieving them will be highly problematic the least of them a genuine ceasefire would effectively freeze the current confrontation in place , with rival camps entrenched in the east and west the conflict could degenerate into a prolonged stalemate , as in the korean peninsula or georgia meaningful negotiation would be impossible while gaddafi remained in power interventionists cannot achieve gaddafi s removal , another key aim , by force of arms , bar a ground invasion or a lucky shot \( the same goes for democratic governance \) the west is relying instead on more mass defections , an army mutiny or a palace coup what analyst shashank joshi of the royal united services institute has called regime breakdown by withholding immediate attacks on friday despite french impatience to get stuck in , obama and cameron appeared to be hoping the pressure on gaddafi and his supporters would lead to internal rupture and an implosion earlier in the week , glenn greenwald at salon questioned not qadaffi s motives , but those of the us  as our other good friends saudi arabia and bahrain collaborate on attacking civilian protesters , there are no calls for us intervention there even though that s arguably more serious than what s happening in libya because those governments serve our interests nor is there much anger among americans \( as opposed to egyptians \) over our decadeslong support for the dictator of egypt \( and most of the other tyrants now suddenly being vilified \) that s because our conduct in the middle east isn t driven by humanitarian objectives no matter how manipulatively that flag is waved it s driven by a desire to advance our perceived interests regardless of humanitarian outcomes , and exactly the same would be true for any intervention in libya even if we were capable of fostering humanitarian outcomes in that nation and that s highly doubtful that wouldn t be our mission daniel larison at eunomia was more upbeat about the turn of events , but agreed that the us goals would certainly go beyond the humanitarian the intervening governments may have caught a lucky break in that gaddafi s desire for selfpreservation has given them a way out of going through with the folly of attacking libya this is temporarily a good outcome for libya s rebels , but there are several reasons why this may still prove to be bad for the us and our allies intervening governments that have committed to providing defense for civilian areas in libya and enforcing a nofly zone are now stuck with that commitment for the foreseeable future that could tie up military resources for as long as the conflict continues , and there s no telling how long that might be we can expect to see a lot more agitation from hawks here and in europe that gaddafi cannot be allowed to remain in power , and they are likely to see gaddafi s acceptance of a ceasefire as an unacceptable maneuver to buy time interventionists sold a libyan war primarily on humanitarian grounds \( saving benghazi , etc \) , but they will not be satisfied at all by a cessation of hostilities ian williams at focal points was a little more scathing and metaphorical in his assessment of the role of the united states in any intervention we can accept that a patient with a brain tumour might desperately need surgery , but there is still cause for alarm if jack the ripper offers to operate both method and motive are open to question so while no person with a conscience wants gaddafi to win his sanguinary battle of repression against his own people , there are more than enough doubts that the us is the appropriate specialist to call however , like jack the ripper they do have the knives
does the securities and exchange commission suffer from trialphobia \? ever since judge jed s rakoff rejected the sec s settlement with citigroup over a malignant mortgage securities deal , the agency has been defending its policy to settle securities fraud cases but the public wants a law order moment , and who can blame them \? of course , there was one criminal trial federal prosecutors in brooklyn brought a case against two bear stearns hedge fund managers who blew up the firm s internal fund , eventually leading to the demise of bear they were acquitted but so far , there s been no civil trial in a major case directly related to the biggest economic fiasco of our time the financial crisis the sec contends that it has received more than 12 billion in penalties from financial crisis cases , having accused 81 people and entities , 39 of them chief executives and other senior officers and it does n't avoid trials altogether the agency has averaged almost 14 trials a year from 2008 to 2010 , compared with about eight from 2001 to 2003 finally , in cases that have n't yet gone to trial , the sec has charged some lowlevel bankers from big wall street firms but no masters of the universe as for the near future , the agency might actually have a financial crisis trial right now , it looks as if cases against the mortgage bank indymac , the brokerage firm stifel nicolaus and the executives who blew up the reserve primary money market fund could go to court but do you see the pattern \? none of those is a major investment bank the sec is just not hauling in the big boys that could change if the sec sued citigroup as judge rakoff noted , citigroup is a recidivist , repeatedly flouting securities laws in its settlement with the bank , the agency cited only one mortgage securities deal , but as my propublica colleague jake bernstein and i wrote , there are many more that look just as rotten yet the reason for putting citigroup in the dock goes beyond the bank itself the sec is not getting big enough settlements out of the largest banks it s not bringing enough financial cases it is n't going after the big banks' top executives it s being way too cautious in its interpretation of its role as defender of the fairness and sanctity of the markets the frustration , shared by judge rakoff and the rest of humanity , is all the greater because the agency rarely , if ever , gets anyone to admit guilt when they settle this renders the settlements little more than turning on the light in a kitchen full of roaches instead of teaching the banks a lesson , the settlements merely show how the bad actors are scattered everywhere and the public watches the banks scurry into the pantry to feast some more to the sec , this view is profoundly unfair the agency s message is , if you want to resolve a case short of a contested proceeding , come in and be prepared to provide the type of relief we would obtain at the end of a trial , said lorin l reisner , the sec s deputy director of enforcement and where that s not available , we 'll go to the mat on a casebycase basis , the sec s argument for settling is strong while the public loves a court case , lawyers often believe that trials are failures they are expensive , timeconsuming and capricious , especially in financial cases that are often so complex they challenge even sophisticated juries generally , securities regulators can rack up more enforcement actions by settling and the agency would do only civil trials anyway it s the justice department that undertakes criminal trials , which probably are a greater deterrent to whitecollar crime fair enough but here s the rub by taking this doctrine too far , the sec has undermined its negotiating position agency officials continually advertise how few resources they have , how costly trials are and how irresponsible it is to shareholders to force a trial when a reasonable settlement can be won instead last month , for example , robert s khuzami , the agency s head of enforcement , trumpeted the sec s recordbreaking performance during a period of resource constraints in doing so , the agency has beltway blinkers on sure , it s speaking to congress , but wall street is also listening when it complains , even legitimately , about its budget or how costly and difficult trials are , the sec is inadvertently showing its belly to wall street in a sign of submission it s whimpering that it will shy away from a trial , afraid of draining its coffers when it s not signaling its fear about spending money , sec officials are often talking about how complex financial crisis cases are in a recent conversation with james b stewart of the new york times , mr khuzami almost sounded as if he were citigroup s counsel , a role for which he is well suited since he held that role at deutsche bank before joining the sec in that interview , he made citigroup s case for it but the bank s lawyers get paid enough and do n't need his help above all , the sec worries about losing that means it does n't push cases that would broaden definitions of securities fraud , the ambitious cases that penetrate the gray areas and eliminate murk as a defense against wrongdoing in his interview with mr stewart , mr khuzami worried aloud that citigroup might have made the proper disclosure in its mortgage deal when it mentioned that it was possible the deal might have an adverse impact on its customers might have \? it absolutely did have a clear adverse impact if you raise an issue as a mere hypothetical when you know for a fact that it s occurring , is n't that misleading \? should n't that be tested \? and tested in court , so that a precedent is set \? to overcome its greatest fear , the sec needs to realize that it can win even if it loses a trial against a big bank could be helpful regardless of the outcome it would generate public interest it would put a face on complex transactions that often are known only by abbreviations or acronyms litigation would cost the bank money , too and it could cast the way wall street does business in such an unflattering light that even if the bank won , it might bring about better behavior a trial would show boldness and when the sec found itself at the negotiating table again , it would feel a new respect this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo robert s khuzami , the sec s enforcement chief , has trumpeted the agency s recordbreaking performance during a period of resource constraints \( photograph by daniel rosenbaum for the new york times \)
for once , the did not lose a hairraising game in their opponent s final atbat , as they had three times in a row this week yes , they did lose but it happened slowly , not suddenly , and when it was over , it was more shruginducing than heartbreaking after showing surprising pluck throughout an adversityfilled july , the mets appear to be unraveling in august in the first game of a vital series against atlanta , the mets showed little drive against the wildcardleading , falling limply , 41 , in front of a crowd of 30 , 607 at citi field the loss dropped the mets \( 5556 \) below 500 and extended their losing streak to five games before the game , manager said he understood the magnitude of the series , considering there were less than two months remaining in the season and that they were chasing the braves , among other teams , for a playoff spot we 're running out of games , collins said i'm not going to hide that the loss , which put nine games between the two teams , increases the sense of urgency for the mets , who face the braves at home five more times in august they all count , but when you 're getting down to the end , they have more of an impact , collins said after the loss though the mets batters started promisingly taking a 10 lead in the first when david wright doubled off the wall in leftcenter field to score daniel murphy from first they were mostly bewildered by braves starter tim hudson and went on to waste yet another solid performance from their own starter , r a dickey after the first , the mets could muster just one more hit off hudson , who showed impressive command of an array of pitches and breezed through the mets' lineup over seven innings to earn his 11th win well , tim hudson is really , really good that s part of it , wright said and we have a lot of young , aggressive hitters , and that plays right into a guy like him the braves , meanwhile , gave hudson the only support he would need when they scored two runs in the third alex gonzalez singled to left field to open the inning and scored on jose constanza s triple to right constanza then scored the goahead run on a sacrifice fly by michael bourn the mets had a great opportunity to counter with two outs in the fourth angel pagan walked and looked as if he would score when jason bay punched a ball into right field but the ball bounced into the seats for a groundrule double , stopping pagan at third lucas duda was hit by a pitch to load the bases but josh thole then hit a soft fly ball to left field to end the inning probably a week ago , the way we were playing , that ball hits the top of the wall , skips into the corner and we get a run and a runner standing at third base , collins said of bay s double but right now we are n't getting those twoout hits that we had been getting dickey pitched seven innings , striking out five , walking none and inducing one groundball out after another with a knuckleball that danced up and down in the strike zone but as in so many other games this season , he fell victim to a lack of run support i thought two runs was going to be good enough to win , personally , dickey said but that s baseball , and i know that sounds so clich , and i'm against clich s , but it s the truth dickey s record dropped to 510 , despite the fact that he has pitched consistently well for the mets this year we got to give him support , collins said r a has pitched a lot better than his numbers after dickey departed , dan uggla buried the mets for good and extended his hitting streak to 26 games with a tworun double off ryota igarashi in the eighth that made the score 41 inside pitch one day after he was found to have a fatigued throwing shoulder , johan santana said his arm felt good and that he still hoped to pitch this year santana , who had surgery to repair a torn capsule in his shoulder last september , said the doctors told him he had tried to do too much too soon after making his first rehabilitation start last week santana will refrain from throwing until he regains full strength in his arm general manager sandy alderson said ike davis , who has been out since may with a bone bruise in his left ankle , would discontinue his running program for four weeks it will then be decided whether he should have surgery at this point , i think it s not looking good for his return in 2011 , alderson said
los angeles in a courtroom here , jeffrey e gundlach , one of the most prominent bond managers in the country , on thursday defended himself against claims that he had planned to sabotage his former employer , trust company of the west , by using stolen data and client information to start a competing firm i took my responsibility at tcw very seriously , he testified i loved tcw the trial involving mr gundlach and tcw , as trust company of the west is better known , resembled a breakup tale as mr gundlach detailed his falling out with tcw , which fired him in december 2009 soon afterward , tcw sued mr gundlach , accusing him of breaching his fiduciary duty and stealing trade secrets to start his new firm , doubleline capital tcw is seeking more than 375 million in damages on the witness stand , mr gundlach , dressed in a gray pinstripe suit and a blue tie , told the jury of seven men and five women that although he and his colleagues had once made preparations to leave tcw , including looking at office space and registering a delaware corporation , he had mothballed those plans by the time he was fired in december 2009 when a tcw lawyer asked him about a doubleline logo he helped design as early as july 2008 , he played it down as a doodle i'm very interested in the artwork of piet mondrian , mr gundlach said i was wondering if i could make a convincing mondrian so far , tcw s case against mr gundlach has hinged on testimony that he and his lieutenants took confidential and proprietary data for use at the new firm also named as codefendants in tcw s lawsuit are former employees cris santa ana , barbara vanevery and jeffrey mayberry , all of whom currently work at doubleline all three have all testified that they downloaded tcw information to external hard drives , but have said that none of the data was used at doubleline mr santa ana has testified that mr gundlach told him to download information , a claim mr gundlach disputed on thursday after mr gundlach was fired in december 2009 , more than 40 of his tcw team members followed him to doubleline anything that was downloaded , we never used at doubleline , mr gundlach said in a taped deposition that was played for the jury the trial is notable for occurring at all most financial employment disputes are settled quietly , but mr gundlach said in an interview this week that the settlement offers he received from tcw were worse than losing in court in a countersuit , mr gundlach is seeking more than 500 million , claiming that he was a victim of a conspiracy to oust him from the firm for a case involving the sleepy mutual fund world , the testimony has at times been shockingly personal so far , witnesses called by tcw have testified that mr gundlach was a cultural cancer who referred to himself as the pope and the godfather in an interview this week , mr gundlach said he did not expect his aggressive personality to be a factor in the trial the fact that they do n't like me does n't mean i 've breached my fiduciary duty , he said earlier in the day , richard villa , tcw s chief financial officer , told the jury that mr gundlach had been paid more than 40 million in 2009 , the year he was fired , and that he had had earned compensation totaling about 240 million for the years from 1991 to 2009 a rare moment of levity occurred during the court session when , in his taped deposition , mr gundlach was asked by john b quinn , a lawyer for tcw , if he knew of any data at tcw , other than a portable alpha trading system , considered proprietary after a long pause , mr gundlach responded , a recipe in the dining room \? mr gundlach will continue his testimony on monday this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo jeffrey gundlach , of doubleline capital and a wellknown bond manager , testified thursday \( photograph by reuters \)
kandahar , afghanistan toor jan , who used to kill americans and canadians here , does not want much from the afghan government a home a job and , yes , eight security guards he needs them as one of the few commanders to switch sides , he is a target in a rare interview , the 28yearold , who is tall , thin and has a full black beard , is somber about the step he has taken , although he is one of the success stories of the government s biggest and bestfinanced peace program , which aims to bring taliban fighters over to the government side , sapping the insurgency s strength when i decided to switch sides , i was fed up with fighting , he said i cannot pull the trigger anymore i am just tired of it toor jan s switch may represent a hopeful sign for the government s plan to reintegrate the taliban into afghan society but it is also a rarity of the 1 , 700 fighters who have enrolled in the 10monthold program , only a handful are midlevel commanders , and twothirds are from the north , where the insurgency is much weaker than in the south , said , the director of a nato unit that is monitoring the program the total is only a fraction of the 20 , 000 to 40 , 000 taliban insurgents , and many of the fighters who have taken advantage of the program may not even be taliban , just men with weapons the taliban s leaders , most of whom are in pakistan , have yet to embrace reconciliation defense secretary robert m gates acknowledged publicly sunday that the united states had begun with members of the taliban , but he expressed skepticism about the results other diplomats said that a significant number of taliban fighters will not switch sides unless such talks advance but western governments are committed to the plan to persuade fighters to switch sides it is well financed , with 140 million of the 150 million pledged from western governments , much of it from the united states and japan , already in afghan accounts , according to a western military official the money provides a small , shortterm stipend to fighters who change sides , and then rewards their communities with generous development and job programs rather than handing out money or jobs to fighters the incentives were designed to prevent abuses of past programs , under which fighters would change sides with the seasons , collecting money in the winter , then resuming the fight in the spring or summer general jones said the program has grown more slowly in the south and east because many fighters fear that if they lay down their arms , the taliban will take revenge on them or their families a western diplomat here who is familiar with the preliminary negotiations with the taliban said , we 'll only see big numbers when there is a little more progress on the political track for that to happen , he said , it s important how pakistan responds even so , western officials say they hope that fighters who have local gripes can be persuaded to enroll in the program you have to look at the motivation of the people doing the fighting , said a western diplomat in kabul a number of people became involved because of local disputes over land , over power , over family honor you do n't need a deal with the taliban leadership to solve those , the official said the taliban is a flag of convenience for them the program s relatively slow growth points to an array of difficulties , according to interviews with afghan governors , nato officials , members of the high peace and reintegration council and western diplomats there are logistical problems each province must have a peace and reconciliation committee to serve as an intermediary between active taliban commanders and the government special bank accounts had to be set up to keep track of the money sent to the provincial governors to run the program afghan and nato officials also have difficulty confirming the identities of those who say they want to switch in kunduz province , many of the 400 taliban who have changed sides in recent months have gone back to their villages to form armed groups , according to the leader of the peace and reconciliation committee there a number of them were given guns to secure their own villages after we received guarantees from the village elders about their honesty and loyalty to the government , said the committee leader , asadullah omerkhel some of those fighters are accused of taxing local people , running protection rackets and even rape , raising the question of whether they are just criminals toor jan is not the only taliban commander in the south to come over to the government s side but the other prominent commander there who has switched may not be who he says he is that commander , maulavi noorullah aziz , said he wanted to make the move in april and turned to a friend from his youth , haji fazaluddin agha , who is now the governor of the panjwai district in kandahar province mr agha sponsored him and introduced him to the provincial governor , wesa toorylai , who held a ceremony to welcome him and at least 30 of his followers as proof of his identity , he offered a letter appointing him as the taliban shadow governor of kunduz that bore the stamp of the quetta shura , the taliban leadership group but some of his claims did not check out for example , although he said he had controlled a district in helmand province , elders there said they had never heard of him western intelligence officials now question his story , although they still think he probably is or was a taliban operative in the meantime , mr aziz has had his eye on a government job and has received a house , protection and food money for an entourage that includes his family and most of his men toor jan s experience was more difficult , in part because he lacked a wealthy political patron he said it took him a year and a half to reach the decision to leave the taliban , which he joined in 2002 he did so , he said , because he had lost friends in the fighting , seen afghan civilians killed when his men s bombs detonated accidentally and , in december , learned that american forces had detained his brother , who he said had done nothing wrong he came in , exhausted , with 12 men in february , hoping that the government would fulfill its promise to protect him , give jobs to his fighters and secure his brother s release his negotiations were with the intelligence department chief in kandahar , whom he had known since childhood and who agreed to pay 120 a month to each of toor jan s men and 150 a month to toor jan himself the standard amount for taliban who decide to switch sides he is living in an abandoned and decrepit former russian army base his brother was released in april , raising toor jan s spirits , but his men are still awaiting jobs the government cannot stand on its promises , he said a good example is my defection in the last five months i have received none of what they promised me no salary , no good accommodations those who are fighting now say your men are jobless what have you achieved \?

over the last decade , florida s hispanic population has exploded , especially in central florida , where the number of hispanic residents in orange county jumped 84 percent they are now 308 , 244 of 12 million residents , about one in four but some here are raising questions about why hispanics' representation on influential political boards has not kept pace with their increase in numbers in this county , of which orlando is the seat last month , only days after the fresh census data reflecting the surge in the hispanic population , county commissioners and the mayor appointed a 15member panel to redraw the boundaries of political districts with data culled from the 2010 census just three of the board members are hispanic the appointing of two nonhispanic whites by county commissioner jennifer thompson \( who , like all the commissioners , had the power to name two panelists \) drew particular criticism because she represents a district that is 384 percent hispanic it just breaks my heart to see that we are here 40 years , and we should be moving forward and included in every segment of the community , and that is just not happening , said trini quiroz , 62 , a community leader who raised her concerns at a recent county commission meeting how do you ignore onethird of the entire population \? it s not right commissioner thompson chose a former colleague at the chamber of commerce and an orange county lawyer when asked by wftv channel 9 news in orlando about why she did not name a hispanic , she said , i would n't say it was a priority but in an interview , commissioner thompson said that her comment was taken out of context she said that no hispanic constituent had applied for the position and since the appointments were made , she has invited hispanics to participate in meetings about redistricting and other subjects of local interest , and to apply for other posts , but none have done so , she said finding a hispanic was not a priority over finding the most qualified individual on that board , she said , citing among the important qualifications the willingness to make the time commitment however , that sentiment angers some of the commissioner s constituents jaye bonner , 62 , a retired former marine and an orange county native , said he was appalled by how few hispanics were on the redistricting board the final decision on the boundaries is in the hands of the county commissioners commissioner thompson claims she could not find a single qualified person , with a high percentage population in the hispanic latino community , to serve on that advisory board , mr bonner said that s just absolutely atrocious in my mind it s almost like they are making an effort to suppress the hispanic representation
bangor , me the mother got the call in the middle of the night her 3dayold baby was going through in a hospital here and had to start taking , a drug best known for treating heroin addiction , to ease his suffering the mother had abused prescription painkillers like oxycontin for the first 12 weeks of her , buying them on the street in rural northern maine , and then tried to quit cold turkey a dangerous course , doctors say , that could have ended in the baby had in utero as a result , and his mother , tonya , turned to methadone treatment , with daily doses to keep her cravings and withdrawal symptoms at bay as prescription ravages communities across the country , doctors are confronting an emerging challenge newborns dependent on painkillers while methadone may have saved tonya s pregnancy , her son , matthew , needed to be painstakingly weaned from it infants like him may cry excessively and have stiff limbs , tremors , and other problems that make their first days of life excruciating many have to stay in the hospital for weeks while they are weaned off the drugs , taxing neonatal units and driving the cost of their medical care into the tens of thousands of dollars like the cocaineexposed babies of the 1980s , those born dependent on prescription opiates narcotics that contain or its derivatives are entering a world in which little is known about the longterm effects on their development few doctors are even willing to treat pregnant opiate addicts , and there is no universally accepted standard of care for their babies , partly because of the difficulty of conducting research on pregnant women and newborns those who do treat pregnant addicts face a jarring ethical quandary they must weigh whether the harm inflicted by exposing a fetus to powerful drugs , albeit under medical supervision , is justifiable i 've had pharmacies that have just called back and said this lady s pregnant why do you want me to fill this scrip \? i ca n't do that , ' said dr craig smith , a family practitioner in but when you stop and think about what actually happens during withdrawal and how violent it can be , that would certainly be not in the baby s best interest still , even doctors who advocate treating pregnant addicts have had moments of doubt at first i was going , gosh , what am i doing \? ' said dr thomas meek , a primary care physician in am i really helping these people \? ' there are no national figures that document the extent of the problem , but interviews with doctors , researchers , social workers and women who abused painkillers while pregnant suggest that it has grown rapidly , especially in rural regions , where officials say such abuse is most common in maine , which has been especially plagued by prescription drug abuse , the number of newborns treated or watched for opiate withdrawal , known as neonatal abstinence syndrome , at the state s two largest climbed to 276 in 2010 from about 70 in 2005 hospitals in states including florida and ohio reported similar increases , and experts said the numbers were probably higher since pregnant women are rarely tested for drug use and many mothers do not admit to abusing opiates tonya , 24 , said she was introduced to painkillers like oxycontin , percocet and vicodin while working the overnight shift at an industrial bakery an hour from her home everyone including coworkers , the boyfriend she met on the job and their manager was taking pills , she said it was a lot easier to get through life and have energy , tonya said at here in january , holding matthew a month after his birth he was still being weaned off methadone before she was pregnant , tonya said , she quickly became addicted , spending all of her money on pills bought on the street she and her boyfriend , josh , needed to stave off withdrawal and get through the day , she said now that she is in treatment , tonya , who like most mothers interviewed for this article did not want her last name used , said her focus was on matthew we put him in this situation , she said , and we have to help him out of it rigorous studies on treating infant withdrawal are scarce , and the has not published guidelines since 1998 it s really remarkable how little we know about the effect of prescription drugs and even nonprescription drugs on the fetus , said , director of the there are real roadblocks in terms of helping us advance the field dr mark l hudak , a neonatologist in jacksonville , fla , is helping to revise the academy s guidelines there are commonalities , but it s not like you can go to a web site that says , this is what should be used by everyone , ' dr hudak said no one knows what the best approach is within states , every hospital that delivers babies exposed to painkillers may have its own approach eastern maine treats affected newborns with tiny doses of methadone , while in portland uses morphine combined with , a barbiturate that prevents seizures some hospitals are also experimenting with , a mild that can relieve withdrawal symptoms there is growing debate over treatment for pregnant women addicted to prescription drugs , in light of concerns over the effects on their babies many are slowly weaned from their dependence with methadone , the standard of care for decades methadone , when taken in prescribed doses , keeps a steady amount of opiate in the body , preventing withdrawal and drug cravings that occur when levels dip but it , too , can be addictive and cause nagging side effects like and for addiction treatment , it can be obtained only at federally licensed clinics where most users have to report for a daily dose a growing number of addicts are instead taking , another drug used to treat addiction that some studies suggest staves off drug cravings as effectively as methadone but is less likely to cause withdrawal in newborns in rural areas of the nation , where methadone clinics are few , buprenorphine is considered a promising alternative because it can be prescribed by primary care doctors and taken at home but buprenorphine also appears not to work for some addicts still , a in the new england journal of medicine showed that babies whose mothers had taken buprenorphine required significantly less medication after birth and less time in the hospital than did babies whose mothers were treated with methadone but researchers cautioned that exposure to buprenorphine in utero can still cause withdrawal symptoms and that further study was needed we do n't want it misconstrued that buprenorphine is a miracle drug , said , a researcher and the study s lead author even less is known about longerterm effects on babies exposed to painkillers , though in a second leg of their study , dr jones and her fellow researchers plan to follow the 131 babies in the cohort until they turn 3 a by the centers for disease control and prevention found that babies exposed to opiates in utero , in this case legally prescribed painkillers , had slightly higher rates of , including congenital heart defects , and  experts say that since many drug users also smoke and abuse alcohol , not to mention that they face extenuating circumstances like poverty , it is difficult to tease out the effects of each substance on their offspring most of the literature suggests consistently that the drug exposure itself is not the primary concern , said , a professor at in philadelphia who studies addiction in pregnant women it s the cumulative effect of the drugusing lifestyle poverty , chaos in the home , domestic violence all those things affect development not all newborns exposed to opiates have severe enough withdrawal to need medicine at maine medical center since 2003 , about 55 percent of babies exposed to buprenorphine and 80 percent of those exposed to methadone have needed treatment but it is hard to predict which ones will need it a newborn whose mother was on a high dose of either drug might need none , while a baby whose mother took a low dose might experience acute withdrawal babies known to have been exposed to drugs are often kept in the hospital for at least five days because withdrawal symptoms usually do not set in immediately nurses examine them for a checklist of symptoms every few hours , assigning each baby a score that , if high enough , calls for treatment they do n't stop crying , they ca n't settle down , they do n't relax , said geraldine tamborelli , nursing director of the birthing unit at maine medical center , which in 2010 diagnosed opiate withdrawal in 121 newborns they 're struggling in your arms instead of snuggling into you like a baby that is totally fine in the neonatal intensive care unit at eastern maine , kendra , 3 days old , was sleeping in a dark , silent room one morning , away from the bustle and bright lights that can be especially irritating to babies going through withdrawal nurses frequently crept in to observe her , though , and by the afternoon her limbs had stiffened and she was crying excessively and having tremors it was enough to begin treatment this seems to be ramping up fairly quickly for her , said dr mark brown , the hospital s chief of pediatrics , so the decision was to start treatment more quickly on the pediatric ward , matthew started fussing while his mother , tonya , talked to reporters that afternoon in january his cry had a strange , reedy pitch that nurses say is common to babies with his condition the small dose of methadone he had received gave him gas and , for which he was given two stomach medications he also was on , a muscle relaxant and antianxiety drug that helped him metabolize the methadone more slowly tonya said that at first she did n't believe in methadone treatment during pregnancy and that doctors had to persuade her that it would not hurt her fetus she had experienced wrenching withdrawal when she stopped using painkillers after learning she was pregnant , she said , and the doctors had warned her that when i was feeling that bad , he was feeling 1 , 000 times worse tonya said that in a previous pregnancy , she quit using drugs altogether and miscarried a month later that was the last thing i wanted to happen this time , she said treating drugdependent mothers and babies is often lonely work , with little communication among the doctors who take it on as dr brown said , my network for people who do this is really very small , an addiction medicine specialist at in westbrook , me , is on a mission to get more of the state s doctors to treat pregnant prescription drug abusers and more hospitals to deliver their babies only a handful of doctors here treat pregnant women with buprenorphine , dr publicker said , partly because they fear liability and do not want to deal with addicts the fact that most hospitals will not deliver the babies makes doctors even less likely to treat the women it s mostly ignorance , dr publicker said it s a concern that it s a risky proposition and that they 're going to wind up with an ill baby in february , dr smith persuaded , which has only 25 beds , to deliver the babies of women on buprenorphine a major victory , he said , because until then women in rural southwestern maine had to drive an hour or more to maine medical to deliver courtney , a patient of dr smith s who discovered she was pregnant while in jail for stealing oxycontin from her landlord , said buprenorphine treatment seemed the best of her bleak options i just do n't want to mess up , she said tonya , too , said she was determined to make things right for matthew , who was five weeks old when she took him home to a trailer outside bangor he is off the methadone now and appears healthy , but tonya still has to go to a methadone clinic in bangor every day for her dose and resist the pressures to return to illicit drug use her boyfriend began using opiates as a young teenager , she said , and his father and grandmother abused oxycontin along with him i'm proud that i changed my life , tonya said but at the same time , when you see your child in pain and you know your child is in pain because of a life decision you made , it s the hardest thing in the world
an irate correspondent is furious with me for dismissing herman cain s ideas cain s program , he angrily asserts , has been endorsed by none other than arthur laffer , a much smarter economist than you indeed , laffer capped his brilliant career two years ago by warning , presciently , that interest rates would soar thanks to the obama plan but seriously or as seriously as anything involving cain can get jared bernstein has a good summary of the reality of nein , nein , nein the key point is that each of the nines is a tax that would more or less fully fall on middleincome families , who in addition to paying 9 percent of their income in taxes would find their living costs 9 percent higher and their wages 9 percent lower that s a 27 percent tax , way above the average federal taxes now paid by middleincome households so the cain plan amounts to a huge tax increase on most americans , but a huge tax cut on the wealthy

the twitter universe was alive on thursday with words , news , whispers no , a tweet that the germanamerican defender timmy chandler could be about to slip through the fingers of jurgen klinsmann and the us national team it all started with a message from the former us national team player tony sanneh \( tonysanneh \) , who also played in the bundesliga during his career \( for hertha berlin and n rnberg \) , that rumor is chandler gonna play for germany lowe visits nberg today l we is joachim l we , the coach of germany s national team nberg is chandler s bundesliga club , n rnberg , which is currently in seventh place in the bundesliga five games into the season according to reports in germany , officials of that country s federation said that l we was not in nuremberg chandler , 21 , the son of an american serviceman and a german woman , has played four times for the us national team under its old coach , bob bradley but none of those appearances have come in official fifa international matches when called to the american team for june s concacaf gold cup , chandler demurred , citing a long and taxing bundesliga season and the need for rest his decision immediately ignited speculation that chandler , a rightside defender , might still be interested in playing for germany and the united states next opportunity to captie chandler to its senior national team will not roll around until the start of regional world cup qualifying next june by contrast , germany still has euro 2012 qualifying matches on its schedule this year , not to mention playing in the tournament next year in poland and ukraine chandler has played internationally for germany , but only as a youth international in friendly games and under rules revised recently by fifa , players can petition for a change of national allegiance , as long as they have not appeared for another country s senior team in an official fifa competition that rule , however , does not apply to chandler , who does not have to petition for a change of national association , according to the us national team s spokesman , michael kammarman if chandler does slip away , which is still to be determined , he would join a number of players with dual nationalities who have chosen not to play for the us the list includes giuseppe rossi \( italy \) , neven subotic \( serbia \) and vedad ibesevic \( bosnia and herzegovina \) would it have made a difference to any of the three if klinsmann had been the coach of the us team at the time \? impossible to say
as chris paul jumped in the air , collected a pass , and rocketed a perfectly placed pass into the hands of aaron gray for an easy scoring opportunity , you could already hear the whispers derrick rose couldn t do that maybe he couldn t yet in paul s moment of perfection , that was anything but the point the problem with superstar players is that their consistent greatness and ability to produce singular plays of profound excellence gives them the illusion of comparability one rimrocking dunk begets a comparison to another , and apparently , one phenomenal pass begets a judgment on the value of two amazing but distinct players praise for the brilliance of one star somehow transitions seamlessly into an attack on another , despite the fact that every jawdropping individual showing is a masterpiece in itself basketball is rooted in competition , but those who follow and analyze the game are perhaps too tempted to create additional competition where there ought to be none the most valuable player award deserves some of the blame the annual controversy over the award s recipient has fueled a passionate , ongoing argument that relies as much on devaluing one star as it does building up another yet ultimately , the culprit seems to be an almost universal overextension of the superstar concept we see kobe bryant duel with lebron james in a christmas day game , and soon that actual oncourt matchup becomes completely overshadowed by ambiguous arguments of both players contributions and worth we re obsessed with the idea that players particularly elite ones must be compared at all times we re programmed to look for the mvp rather than appreciate the brilliant displays put in front of us independent of the baggage of accolades what purpose is there in removing ourselves from paul s dominance of the lakers , of a moment in time , of the point guard position to compare him to a player halfway across the country engaged in a completely different series \? arbitrarily picking the triumphs of one player over another represents a callous disregard for the context that lent those triumphs their meaning the incredible accomplishments of the game s best simply exist on different planes , and pitting them against one another for our own amusement only cheapens the entire basketball experience there is no chris paul vs derrick rose the competition between them is false in anything other than a game between the hornets and bulls , and exercising in debate over their merits does a disservice to both players when paul executes an unbelievable pass through traffic , rose should be the furthest thing from our minds when rose spins through the lane and pulls off an impossible doubleclutch layup , there should be no reason to note that paul could or couldn t do the same i m hardly ambitious nor foolish enough to implore anyone to table such debate altogether the needless comparison of players has become a central part of the sports fan experience , and it may be completely inextricable from basketball itself at this point yet all that i ask is that in these splendid , captured moments rose s fast break spin , kevin durant s swooping layup , amar e stoudemire s contorting drive we abstain from the debate and let ourselves slip into total immersion as paul jumps in the air , collects a pass , and rockets a perfectly placed pass into the hands of aaron gray for an easy scoring opportunity , we shouldn t hear whispers of rose or any other player only the beautiful contrast of unbridled excitement and stunned , awestruck silence

congress rarely remembers that it is responsible for overseeing the the partyhackridden agency that enables campaign abuses the has now summoned about its work rather than a severe grilling , it s more likely to be a meetandgreet smile among professional backslappers the need for a vigilant fec has never been greater as the nation enters the most moneydrenched campaign in history , thanks to the new super pac bundlers and the supreme court s citizens united decision blessing unlimited corporate donations while all this looms , the sixmember fec has been stymied by its three republican appointees who apparently believe the best campaign regulation is none and regularly reject professional staff findings of campaign abuses and block enforcement politicians know a toothless watchdog when they see one in the latest outrage , senator mike lee , a republican of utah , asked the fec for an advisory opinion on whether he can raise unlimited funds for his own leadership political action committee this is clearly barred by law it would ensconce moneyed princes on capitol hill to buy lawmakers' favors from within surely the fec can muster the courage to shoot that down surely \? congress should be reforming the agency , and president obama should be challenging congress to do it the fec needs commissioners who do n't owe their positions to either party machine the president can drive the issue by proposing truly independent appointees to the senate to replace lameduck members

in the seamy underbelly of folkart collecting , owners over the past century have muddied the attributions of works , brazenly added new flourishes to old woodcarvings , and let bird droppings and paint spatters gather on canvases in storage the historian elizabeth stillinger has named culprits in she researched the book for about 15 years , poring through museum and family archives reporting

port st lucie , fla last autumn asked , one of its former studentathletes , to join an athletics advisory committee young promptly accepted , and he does not expect it to be an honorary post , so princeton will soon be hearing his strong and clear opinions about the state of major college athletics young , who played basketball and baseball at princeton , loves college sports and , like millions of americans , is looking forward to the ncaa basketball tournament but young thinks that many college sports , especially basketball and football , have become corrupted by an overemphasis on winning and financial considerations , leaving the educational interests of the studentathletes secondary at best to help address that problem , young would like to see entrance into the tournament and the salaries of the coaches directly linked to a team s graduation rate what s the point of having a team full of guys who are great athletes and they can win a national championship and none of them graduate \? young said there are some programs like that , where the coaches do n't care whether their players graduate or not the business side has become so dominant that the education has been overlooked there is so much money involved , and that becomes the bigger issue than kids going to school and getting an education young and his wife , elizabeth , who played soccer at princeton , were both asked to serve on the athletics board they have not had a chance to serve yet because the first meeting conflicted with spring training , but young is looking forward to participating he played basketball and baseball at princeton from 1998 to 2000 although he had to give up both sports after he signed with the pittsburgh pirates in september 2000 , he remained in college to earn his degree and said he cherished his experience playing sports sports are a great way to teach , he said but the purpose , the goal of college athletics , is to educate in some cases , the lines between winning and educating have been blurred the ncaa needs to look into that on saturday at 4 pm , young intends to watch his alma mater play harvard in that will decide which of the ivy league cochampions will earn an automatic bid to the ncaa tournament the 6foot10 young is all for the competition he just feels that at times it s more about the coaches and the television deals than it is about the studentathletes there is no doubt that there are a lot of places where the coaches are bigger than the program , and sometimes even the school itself , young said in those instances , the schools have fostered that a little bit we 've seen some instances where the coaches have done some shady things and are allowed to get away with it because of the success of the program that s not in the best interest of the studentathletes inside pitch the sent 11 players over to minor league camp , including outfielder fernando martinez and shortstop ruben tejada manager terry collins said martinez could be recalled anytime in case there is a need in right field with carlos beltran dealing with left knee tendinitis collins said backup catcher ronny paulino finally received his visa and arrived in port st lucie on friday he is expected in camp to work out on saturday the mets crushed the marlins , 100 , as josh thole and ike davis hit home runs the marlins made five errors commissioner don garber of major league soccer , which would like to put a second franchise in the new york city area , told reporters during a conference call that he thought the wilpon family , which owns the mets , would make great owners in mls , despite their legal and financial troubles
ezra klein has a generally reasonable analysis of the obama administration s failure to respond with sufficient force to the economic crisis broadly speaking , he s saying that the eurovenn applied an economically adequate response lay beyond the bounds of the politically feasible in general , i m trying not to do too much looking back the question is what to do now still , i guess this needs addressing there s certainly a lot to ezra s thesis yet i think he lets obama and company off the hook too much a few specific points 1 i think too much is being made of the fact that subsequent revisions have shown that the economy was in even worse shape in early 2009 than we knew at the time there was already plenty of evidence that it was in terrible shape and needed a much bigger boost than the administration proposed and as regular readers know , this isn t 2020 hindsight i was frantic about this at the time 2 the forecast that assumed rapid recovery even without stimulus has been a deep source of embarrassment , and remains inexplicable to me we had lots of reason to believe that this was going to be a prolonged slump not just reinhart rogoff , but also the evidence of the last two us business cycles again , i was warning about this at the time 3 this in turn means that the focus on fastacting policies was misplaced shovelready wasn t as important as it was made out to be and the stimulus would have been a lot closer to adequate if more of it had consisted of infrastructure spending rather than tax cuts 4 politically , the administration was wildly naive in believing that it could easily come back for more if the initial stimulus proved inadequate again , this isn t hindsight i was frantic about this too , right from the beginning if they thought this likely as they should have they should have laid the legislative groundwork for a second round , through reconciliation if necessary , right at the start 5 even without that groundwork , my sense is that there was a window for additional action in the fall of 2009 , and that the administration sheered off from even trying 6 relatedly , the insistence of the administration that the stimulus was just right , long after it was obvious that it had been too small , did a lot of political damage remember the summer of recovery \? 7 the political response to the new jobs bill has been pretty good which in turn strongly suggests that the pivot from jobs to deficit reduction in early 2010 was a big mistake maybe probably nothing could have passed but the white house might have been able to make a better case by accusing republicans of blocking job creation rather than adopting their rhetoric now , ezra may be right that none of this would have made much difference but the white house was weak and confused in the face of a political and economic debacle , when it should have gone all out and you know what \? it should still go all out the chances of success are lower than they would have been if it had taken a strong position two years ago , but it ain t over until it s over
had you been at roulette , the theater in downtown brooklyn , on friday night , you would have learned or been reminded of a few things performing artists are unparalleled and exciting problem solvers , for example the creative process , on the other hand , is often quite boring and the saints are the sinners who keep trying this last nugget of wisdom was the final sentence uttered in the friday installation of , the madhouse series concocted by the choreographer sally silvers each evening during the fourday event three trios of choreographers and directors were paired with a handful of performers the arranged marriages happened just before the show the teams then had a halfhour \( there were timers \) to make something and immediately perform it , all in the open is there anything more fickle than an audience member \( this one included \) \? friday night s crowd , which thinned as the twohour event stretched on , was appreciative of serendipitous moments but not necessarily patient with the compressed , manic efforts that produced them this has to be longer than 25 minutes , one woman said none too quietly during the middle group and then she added theater people always get more time and they cheat by cheat she may have meant the directors' proclivity for various jumpstarting devices , including props \( martini glasses , root vegetables , even hapless audience members \) and language aids \( scripts , dialogue exchanges and cookie fortunes , whence came the saints and sinners \) to be fair , though , the choreographers often began with their own language equivalent preset movement phrases some of these external concepts worked out swimmingly , as when claire porter \( in the group led by jane comfort , douglas dunn and lizzie olesker \) offered one fortune after another , pulling the slips of paper from various parts of her person and sometimes interrupting her own delivery for comments in between interruptions by k j holmes noodling about her in annoying littlesibling fashion poetry and humor in under 30 minutes not too shabby but by and large , preconceived frameworks tended to get in the way the directors damien gray and scott lyons and the choreographer keely garfield had the most laborious external conceit , roping large sections of the audience into an overstuffed theatrical universe with too many busily moving parts \( though ms garfield did give the millingabout audience contingent a witty movement vocabulary \) the real excitement friday was generated by smart bodies casting about in time and space without a prescribed route and the night s most intriguing moving part was from emily joy , or sk8 crime , a , who performed in the group led by the choreographers patricia hoffbauer and jonathan kinzel and the director mike taylor ms taylor provided some scripted dialogue while the choreographers issued openended instructions , riffing on each other s and the performers' material when you have dancers like edisa weeks and jodi melnick , in a situation like this you have to be quick to catch whatever riches come your way i suppose you could say the same for those of us watching the final shows were n't ever the prizes here
he was from goldman sachs that is the refrain you hear over and over again when mf global insiders try to explain why they went along with jon corzine s risky trades the same ones that caused a crisis of confidence at the firm and , ultimately , its bankruptcy on monday mr corzine was at goldman sachs for nearly 25 years , rising to become its senior partner before being ousted in a boardroom coup in 1999 he was considered a bright , aggressive trader who had a history of making big bets that paid off when he joined mf global last year after a decade in politics as a democratic senator and governor of new jersey he talked openly about his ambition to create a minigoldman being a former goldmanite has long been considered the ultimate calling card but , in some cases , it has proved to be a liability a series of blunders by former senior goldman executives raises questions about whether goldman s secret sauce can actually be exported think john thain or robert rubin or j chris flowers those people walked around with halos around them myths have been created on wall street nowhere is the myth bigger than at goldman , william cohan , the author of money and power , how goldman sachs came to rule the world , a 658page volume that explored the firm s history and culture , said in an interview but mr cohan , pausing briefly , added that whatever myths might exist around goldman , everybody puts their pants on the same way , one foot at a time it is a lesson that some of goldman s smartest alumni have learned the hard way , none more so than mr corzine his outsize bets at mf global on european sovereign debt many of which he made personally proved the firm s undoing because of the large amount of leverage that he used to magnify his bets as of the firm s filing at the end of june , it had 444 billion worth of liabilities yet it only had 14 billion of equity that kind of leverage was enough to scare credit ratings agencies into downgrading the firm last week , which led counterparties to stop trading with it in truth , mr corzine s bet may still prove to be correct many of the italian and spanish bonds that mr corzine bought most of which mature in 2012 are still trading at 98 and 99 cents on the dollar mr corzine s investment thesis always was that the european central bank and the european union would find a way to prop them up but mr corzine s bets also relied on shortterm funding and , given the skepticism in the market , counterparties quickly ran for cover even if mr corzine s gamble was right , it is hard to believe that he could have made such a large bet at goldman sachs the one thing goldman really does well better than everyone else is the internal accounting and compliance function they give those people a lot of power , mr cohan said at mf global , mr cohan asked who in the world was going to stand up to jon corzine \? nobody they did n't have the compliance or the culture that may be the special ingredient at goldman while the firm encourages risktaking by its traders , it also empowers its risk managers at other firms considered the back office to constantly challenge even the most senior leaders to keep them from going over the cliff lloyd blankfein , goldman s current chief executive , loves to tell people that he spends 98 percent of my time thinking about 2 percent probabilities that is not something you hear from most bank chief executives in the case of mr corzine , at mf global , he was the chairman and chief executive given that he was directing the investment strategy , he might as well have been the compliance officer too the only people with any authority who could have meaningfully pushed back were the board and it is possible the goldman halo may have even kept regulators at bay the firm may have been cut some slack given who he is , said chris rupkey , chief financial economist at bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj \( still , he says he think it was unlikely \) once outside of the goldman fishbowl , with its layers of risk management , wall street can become a lonely place for some of its most famous alumni mr thain , goldman s former chief financial officer , took the top job at merrill lynch after personally doing what he thought was a deep dive into the firm s financial records and declaring that the firm had a clean bill of health less than a year later , he was forced to sell the firm to bank of america and was later fired after the disclosure of huge losses \( in fairness , mr thain did n't create merrill s problems they happened on stanley o'neal s watch but he did n't manage them particularly well \) robert rubin , the former cochairman of goldman and former treasury secretary joined citigroup as a senior adviser and board member in 1999 a dazzling trader when he was at goldman , he counseled citigroup that the firm should take more risk while he did not manage the firm s trading or its daytoday activities , the firm lost more than 70 percent of its value during his tenure , and ultimately the government had to bail out the company twice it is clearly debatable whether he deserves blame , but the outcome is incontrovertible what is clear is that citigroup did not have the kind of risk management or culture that mr rubin had grown accustomed to at goldman likewise , mr flowers , a remarkable goldman banker , left the firm in 1998 to strike out on his own one of his first investments longterm credit bank of japan , which became shinsei bank turned out to be a grand slam home run , reaping him 1 billion in profits but since then , the investment has lost ground and his investment record has been spotty his most recent fund has already lost almost 4 billion which brings us back to mr corzine , who is a good friend of mr flowers mr corzine happens to be an operating partner and investor in mr flowers s firm mr flowers is , in turn , an investor in mf global his fund stands to lose about 48 million as a result of mf s bankruptcy maybe they could have used another risk manager from goldman \?

propublica has published a good update on concerns that existing practices for extracting and piping natural gas , through leakage , substantially cut into the fuel s substantial greenhousegas advantage over coal  a prime source for the story , robert w howarth of cornell university , is right in his draft paper on such emissions that complete lifecycle analysis is sorely needed to clarify the overall costs and benefits of gas drilling particularly the fastspreading extraction method known as hydrofracking but none of this , in my view , undercuts the importance of natural gas as a bridge fuel on the path to a lowercarbon , and more secure , energy menu as humanity sprints toward 9 billion people seeking decent lives it does reinforce the need to extract gas without environmental harms , and to thoroughly explore complaints in gas country an epa analysis , due in 2012 , should help it also means it s way past time for industry to get far more serious about stanching gas leaks that some companies \( led by bp , irony noted \) have shown can routinely be plugged at a profit \( as i reported in 2009 \) the propublica piece expands on findings i reported in the print paper and on dot earth in 2009 showing that the amount of gas leakage from wells , pipelines and storage facilities for gas and oil was vastly greater than longstanding environmental protection agency estimates  have a look at this amazing video above , compiled by the epa , revealing with infrared photography how plumes of gas rise from otherwise innocuous structures and facilities the climate issue \? natural gas , when extracted and burned without leakage , produces about half the carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced compared to coal but when the gas escapes to the atmosphere , it exerts a potent heattrapping influence because the main constituent in natural gas is methane , which is the second most important humangenerated greenhouse gas , not far behind carbon dioxide new rules for reporting methane \( and carbon dioxide \) emissions that have kicked in for some facilities this year will slowly raise pressure on industry to stanch such leaks but it s shameful that it takes a regulatory push for this to happen while corporate policies at most gas and oil companies still favor investing in new drilling rather than cutting gas leakage from existing operations , plenty of companies that have pushed to stop leaks have shown it s a profitable \( even more so in other countries where leakage is vastly greater \) let s hope president obama s revamping of his energy and climate team \( if you hadn t heard , carol browner , the white house czar for these issues , is leaving \) results in more support for the epa unit working with industry to redefine best practices to recap , though , i ve got to restate something i wrote in december about those who would use the leakage issue to challenge any expansion of gas extraction i agree with christopher helman over at forbes who recently wrote that low gas prices mean there s little to lose by holding up drilling in highly contested areas \( the marcellus shale here in new york being the prime battle zone \) while the epa review is completed but campaigners who fight natural gas altogether , like anyone else immersed in the struggle over an energy policy that works for the long haul , would do well to come up with a realworld game plan for supply sufficient energy to foster human progress while limiting environmental risks otherwise , they ve moved from the nimby camp to the world of the banana \( build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything \)
this has been a clarifying week for the 2012 election thursday s republican debate reminded everyone why mitt romney is the frontrunner , as his rivals left the former massachusetts governor more or less untouched saturday s ames straw poll disposed of tim pawlenty , who not so long ago seemed positioned to give romney a real challenge instead , that challenge will probably come from rick perry , whose entrance into the race promises to set up a romneyperry slugfest for the nomination , with michele bachmann playing spoiler romney and perry will be competing to face possibly the weakest incumbent since jimmy carter , with the world in turmoil and the economy adrift six months ago , it still seemed as if republican primary voters might be choosing a sacrificial lamb to run against barack obama now it looks as if they might be choosing the next president this should inspire republicans to return , yet again , to the question that has dogged their party s field all year is this really the best we can do \? the answer is no no one doubts romney s intelligence or competence , but he has managed to run for president for almost five years without taking a single courageous or even remotely interesting position the thinking person s case for romney , murmured by many of his backers , amounts to this vote for mitt , you know he does n't believe a word he says but his phoniness would remain a weakness even if he won the presidency he s a born compromiser pretending to be a hardliner , and the hardliners know it which means he would enter the oval office with conservative knives already sharpened and ready for his back rick perry has many of the qualities that romney seems to lack backbone , core convictions , a killer instinct and a primal understanding of the rightwing electorate he also has the better story where romney has to run away from his massachusetts health care bill and downplay his years as a downsizing artist at bain capital , perry can spend the campaign reminding voters that almost half of the new jobs in obama s presidency were created on his watch in texas what perry does n't have , though , is the kind of moderate facade that americans look for in their presidents he s the conservative id made flesh , with none of the postpartisan uniternotadivider spirit that successful national politicians usually cultivate imagine if the democratic party nominated a combination of al franken and nancy pelosi for the presidency , and you have a sense of the kind of gamble republicans would be taking with perry and even if that gamble worked , little in his record suggests that he s prepared to preside over a polarized country , or negotiate his way through a divided washington maybe perry has hidden subtleties maybe romney has hidden convictions but if this is a 1970s moment for america and the world , the republican frontrunners look more like john connally and gerald ford than ronald reagan or margaret thatcher so whose door should republicans be knocking on instead \? unless mitch daniels changes his mind or jeb bush changes his last name , the only compelling possibility remaining is gov chris christie of new jersey of course christie has ruled out running \( so had perry , not so long ago \) of course it would be an epic gamble on his part , since a loss would mark the end of his garden state career of course christie has obvious weaknesses the brevity of his gubernatorial experience , the fact that he s more moderate than his party s base , the fact that it s been a hundred years since america elected a president with his avoirdupois but the looming romneyperry showdown throws christie s strengths into sharp relief unlike the unloved romney , christie has a huge among movement conservatives , who love his combative style enough to forgive his ideological deviations unlike perry , he s campaigned and governed outside the republican party s sun belt strongholds unlike both , he embodies the kind of voter who swings elections in america not a mormon businessman or a cowboybooted texan , but a catholic with middleclass roots born one state over from the rust belt moreover , serving as the budgetcutting republican governor of a democratic state is a far , far better preparation for what awaits the next president than either perry s smallgovernment idyll or romney s permanent campaign in his brief new jersey tenure , christie has accomplished more , against more determined opposition , amid more media scrutiny and with more than almost any great recession politician six months ago , the best argument for a christie campaign was that the republican party needed him that was n't nearly enough to justify the risk but if the country needs him \? then it might be worth considering
florham park , nj jerricho cotchery has played football for 21 years , since he was 7 in birmingham , ala , and to do something for that long , especially at a high level , requires a lot of emotion still , he loves football he loves it in a much quieter way than , say , braylon edwards and santonio holmes , the two receivers brought in since october 2009 to fortify , if not electrify , ' passing attack cotchery gets along fine without calling as much attention to himself as do edwards or holmes asked if he ever tried to calm his teammates , laughed and said i try to , sometimes , but it does n't work sometimes , it just throws gas on it cotchery also played down his importance , both as a receiver and a team leader , in the jets' run to their second straight afc championship game , but his teammates said they probably would not have made it without cotchery , at 28 the reliable old hand cotchery caught five passes for 96 yards in sunday s over the patriots , including a 58yard reception on a short crossing pattern from mark sanchez that set up holmes s acrobatic thirddown touchdown catch but cotchery is esteemed for other reasons he means everything to this team , tight end dustin keller said thursday if you lined up 11 jerricho cotcherys on offense , you 'd never be stopped on a single drive if he does n't have something perfected , completely , he s practicing it until he does get it right edwards called cotchery that glue of the jets edwards said he thought cotchery knew the playbook better than sanchez if edwards forgets what he is supposed to do on a play , he asks cotchery , who knows everyone s assignments cotchery said edwards was sometimes such an excitable player that he feels the need to calm him , at least enough so that edwards can execute his assignments edwards has said he is a happier person and a more productive player cotchery s guidance is one reason he s a professional , ultimate class , the ultimate team guy , somebody you definitely can learn from , edwards said i feel like i'm a better teammate i feel like i'm a better player for being around him , how he approaches the game on a daytoday basis how professional he is cotchery caught 41 passes in 14 regularseason games he had twice as many receptions in 2006 and 2007 edwards caught 53 passes this season , and holmes caught 52 even though he was suspended for the first four games cotchery has been overshadowed but hardly forgotten on wednesday , sanchez talked glowingly about how cotchery did a great job of getting open on that critical pass play , then changing direction , breaking a tackle and sprinting down the sideline as if he were returning a kickoff it was awesome just to watch him do that , sanchez said for him to rack up yards like that and make a big push for us when we needed it the most was huge , sanchez added all last year , and throughout this year , he s been there for me just as a safety valve , making some huge plays for a young quarterback and bailing me out he s done a great job the last game was perfect for him he deserved that cotchery missed two games in the middle of the season victories over houston and cincinnati after in a 2620 overtime victory over cleveland coach rex ryan said he had never seen a play like it cotchery , holding his left leg and in excruciating pain , hopped on his right foot nine times to get far enough away from defensive back eric wright to make the catch he returned two weeks later , unchanged the jets have a reputation for being brash , but cotchery said that s not my style you ca n't get out of character you ca n't start doing things that you do n't normally do because the next thing you know , you 're distracted you 're not focused on what you need to be focused on i approach it accordingly holmes showed up for a news conference wednesday wearing a white tshirt with flight boys printed in green on the front , with the jersey numbers of holmes , edwards and cotchery underneath we 've got a guy who has been around this team for seven years , jerricho , holmes said braylon , who is a sixyear vet and a pro bowler , and myself , who is a winner we have playmakers we wanted to build something among ourselves so that none of us felt like we 're being left out cotchery was not invited to hold a news conference in a makeshift auditorium at the jets' practice compound he did interviews at his locker thursday , as usual , then gathered his playbook and quietly went to a meeting , as usual

in the 40 years since john e zuccotti joined city government as a parttime , 15 , 000ayear member of the city planning commission , he has been chairman of the commission , first deputy mayor , chairman of the real estate board of new york and the united states chairman of the global real estate giant brookfield properties , which owns , among other buildings , the world financial center in lower manhattan but none of those titles or positions catapulted him into greater , if unwitting , prominence than the continuing occupy wall street demonstrations staged from the tiny downtown park that brookfield owns and that bears his name zuccotti park has become a muchspoken name among protesters camped there and among followers of the protest movement that has been gaining steam in other american cities the blocklong , halfacre park has arguably become one of the city s betterknown patches of greenery yet most of the park s occupants , who are railing against what they deem the inequities of the financial system , probably have no idea who mr zuccotti is certainly , nobody recognized him during several casual sojourns he has made to the park from his office at the world financial center to survey the scene , including one on wednesday \( he said he did not interact with any of the protesters \) mr zuccotti did remember getting a call from a relative in italy my cousin called and said everyone in genoa was saying , 'is that your relative \? ' i 've become famous the park was created as a public space in return for allowing the original owners to build a larger office tower in 1968 a public plaza typically does not , however , allow overnight camping or serve as a regular staging ground for mass protests but mr zuccotti , who cuts a judicious , even owlish , figure at 74 , is no stranger to gracious hospitality one of his first jobs was checking hats at the el morocco night club where his father was the head waiter and later the incontrovertible guardian of the velvet rope as the maitre d' as for brookfield s continued welcome , mr zuccotti said , my guess is that we basically look to the police leadership and mayor to decide what to do the protesters are not your typical el morocco crowd they are considerably more democratic and , arguably , more diverse in their political agenda according to what i read , the nature of the protest has been a little vague , said mr zuccotti , who returned to new york on tuesday after traveling in europe if you go there , you ca n't tell the protesters from the tourists , he added it has a kind of festive atmosphere after his visit on wednesday , though , he said the park has gotten a little messy , adding sooner or later we 're going to have to get in to clean it with gas generators and other things there , we do n't want anybody to get hurt the park , which was originally known as 1 liberty plaza , was renamed liberty park after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 in 2006 , after an 8 million renovation to repair damage from the attack on the world trade center , the pink granite park was renamed for mr zuccotti the gesture marked his public service as a savior of the city while deputy mayor under mayor abraham d beame during the 1970s fiscal crisis , and as a vigorous cheerleader for downtown s revival after the terrorist attacks mr zuccotti lives in brooklyn with his wife , susan sessions zuccotti , a historian and the author of several books about the holocaust the park is adorned with several dozen honey locust trees and a large abstract sculpture called joie de vivre and another of a businessman with a briefcase mr zuccotti said he had no idea that the park was to be named for him until he arrived for the rededication ceremony i started to notice there were all these people from various stages in my life , and suddenly it dawned on me they were pulling a fast one , mr zuccotti said it was a complete surprise during the ceremony , he recounted what president lyndon b johnson said in dedicating a building in washington when mr zuccotti was a special assistant at the department of housing and urban development my pappy would have enjoyed it and my mammy would have believed it what about his parents \? what would they have thought about the park and the protest \? they would have been proud of the name , he replied , and they probably would have said , 'i hope they 're keeping the park clean this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos john e zuccotti , after whom zuccotti park was named \( photograph by fred r conrad the new york times \) in november 1975 , mayor abraham d beame , right , announced the appointment of mr zuccotti as deputy mayor \( photograph by neal boenzi the new york times \)
the big east conference s strut has officially been reduced to a stumble when the dust settled and the tournament s round of 32 drew to a close sunday night , just 2 of the league s 11 teams were left standing , and both reached that point by eliminating teams from their own conference the implosion was swift and sudden it began thursday , when no 4 louisville was upset by no 13 morehead state in the round of 64 it continued saturday , when no 1 pittsburgh was surprised by no 8 butler , and it turned surreal sunday night , when no 2 notre dame was ousted by no 10 florida state the results obviously are n't what we were hoping for , big east commissioner john marinatto said the big east is now 99 in the tournament , with no 3 connecticut and no 11 marquette advancing to the round of 16 the huskies defeated no 6 cincinnati and the golden eagles toppled no 3 syracuse in the round of 32 this collapse comes one week after the league sent a record 11 teams to the tournament , shattering its mark of eight and filling the field so thoroughly that two round of 32 games pitted its teams against each other supporters said the league was being rewarded for a dominant season skeptics said it had too many plates at the buffet line the question remains whether a fourday slice is a fair samplesize to judge a league that dominated nonconference opponents during the regular season the big east s ncaa tournament struggles could simply be the result of unlucky or unusual circumstances , but they could also indicate that these teams are more vulnerable than they seemed jerry palm , publisher of collegerpicom , said he was not surprised by the big east s missteps because few of its teams feature surefire firstround picks , often an ingredient for a final four run but palm said the uneven showing did not mean that any of the big east s 11 teams should have been omitted from the tournament you do n't validate or justify anything like tournament selection or seeding based on what actually happened in the tournament , palm said it s based on the regular season , and whatever happens in the tournament , happens butler should n't have been a one seed because they beat a one louisville was n't overseeded as a four just because they lost a game to a 13 the big east has faced some unfortunate turns no 6 st john s , which lost to no 11 gonzaga in the round of 64 , was without the injured senior forward d j kennedy no 6 georgetown s loss to no 11 virginia commonwealth was point guard chris wright s first game back after missing three weeks with a broken hand morehead state inched past louisville , 6261 , with a lastminute flurry , and butler escaped against pittsburgh after the bulldogs' matt howard was fouled 90 feet from his basket with eighttenths of a second left , then made the winning free throw even the big east s bright spots were tempered , as connecticut and marquette advanced by winning the first round of 32 games ever to involve teams from the same conference the body of work that our schools created over the course of the year certainly overshadows what happens in the tournament , marinatto said in the tournament , you have to get lucky , you have to be fortunate everything has to come together and this year , none of that has happened for the big east its teams have traveled a road to the final four filled with potholes while other improbable stories emerged the traditionally powerful atlantic coast conference , which was criticized for being a weak league this year , sent three of its four teams to the round of 16 the mountain west conference and the colonial athletic association have a combined record of 83 nothing surprises me in this tournament , said the former providence coach tim welsh , who is now an analyst for sny when you have 11 teams in , something s going to happen
hollywood , calif the boxing genius of includes feet that belong in , calves the size of grapefruits and deceptive power generated from his core his movement is unorthodox , scattered and perpetual , as if designed by a jazz musician he creates angles unlike any other fighter , past or present , appearing , disappearing , shifting , striking on balance , off balance , even off one foot it is this style part performance art , part technical wizardry , unique to pacquiao that defines perhaps the best boxer of his generation and it started with a videotape of the martial artist who became his idol it started with bruce lee last month , as pacquiao molded his style specific to , his welterweight opponent on saturday in las vegas , he wrapped his hands inside the dressing room at the wild card boxing gym here to explain the way he fights , he settled on three words like bruce lee , he said growing up in the philippines , pacquiao studied lee , watching his movies on endless loops he still often views his collector s set enter the dragon is his , alex ariza , says he believes pacquiao built his baseline movement off lee s template , the continual attacking , the feet drummed in and out bruce lee jumped around and kicked his feet and shook his head and shoulders , ariza said his feet moved in concert with his hands he could be choppy , but he was rhythmic manny does the same thing it comes from that a stickthin , onedimensional lefthander wild card in 2001 , his style still reckless , raw pacquiao punched at high volume , seeking knockouts , but struggled against superior technicians by then , pacquiao possessed the basics of his skill set because he fought with the speed of the boxers he most admired , pacquiao cornered opponents , made them feel squeezed his tempo , the shawn porter said , feels less like 1 2 3 and more like 123456 if pacquiao s trainer , freddie roach , could place one boxing skill above all others , he said , speed is the greatest asset in the world pacquiao s speed is evident at , even the comedian don rickles said pacquiao reminded him of sugar ray leonard the early pacquiao combined feet that moved like lightning with uncommon power for a man his size , power that started in those calves \( his adviser mike koncz said thick legs ran in the family \) and wound through his torso after erik morales in 2005 , roach decided pacquiao needed balance , and roach set about enhancing his right hand in practice , roach instructed pacquiao to throw jabs , uppercuts and hooks in three to fourpunch combinations , all righthanded it took three years , but a different fighter emerged against david diaz , and pacquiao later knocked out ricky hatton with a right roach divides pacquiao s career into two periods before the diaz fight and after his style had started to take shape the next epiphany occurred by accident , when , during training , pacquiao shifted left , around roach and tapped his trainer on his left shoulder what are you going to do now \? he asked roach was stunned back when roach fought , boxers mostly engaged straight on his work with pacquiao , the angles they created , changed the way roach trained if pacquiao shifted left , outside the right foot of his opponents , their natural instinct was to follow into his left hand if opponents chose not to engage , they had one option , to back away roach says pacquiao improves his position with each angle created and makes it more difficult to counterpunch roach and pacquiao design angles specific to each opponent the key , roach said , is creating space and confusion he still taps me on the shoulder every session , roach said i 'll always try to counter with what his next opponent would do i always lose roach and pacquiao did not invent this approach to boxing roach cited george foreman s of gerry cooney as an earlier example but they elevated angles into art roach sees boxing s future in pacquiao s fancy footwork as pacquiao kept moving up in weight divisions , roach worried less about the weight or power that pacquiao could add and more about the speed he could lose roach told ariza , do not screw up his speed in all his years , through dozens of world champions , roach never saw a fighter who gained so much weight and retained speed and power as a result , suspicions have been raised that pacquiao used performanceenhancing drugs , a charge his camp denies \( pacquiao has never failed a test \) ariza points to other factors different diet , isometric exercises for balance , plyometric exercises for explosiveness he s also just a freak , ariza said his resting heart rate in the morning is 42 beats per minute if he did half the work he does , he would still be where he is today in his last fight , pacquiao middleweight antonio margarito when , robert garcia , watched film of pacquiao , he saw a somewhat vulnerable fighter who lunged too often and left himself exposed at least it seemed that way garcia instructed margarito to attack the body , but he failed to keep up and lost vision in one eye when pacquiao fractured his orbital bone whatever plan you have against pacquiao , he just terminates it , garcia said what seems possible on video is not nobody fights like him awkward , quick , strong , fast , good reflexes nobody that complete in recent years , pacquiao honed the footwork that roach said he deserved more credit for when he moves , roach said , his footwork is so exact , so perfect , it s what creates the angles and wins all his fights roach sees poetry when pacquiao s feet pump , but less like ballet and more like what ariza calls the riverdance the continual movement makes pacquiao difficult to time this disrupts the rhythm of his opponents , forces them to take risks it s an unpolished but very compelling and original athleticism , the joe goossen said it s not a continuing flow of beauty it can be herkyjerky it can be harsh , deliberate , unorthodox but it s effective roach says he wishes pacquiao would finish opponents sooner , thinks pacquiao is too nice but pacquiao views his style as boxing entertainment he relishes the stage , revels in the attention pacquiao also became a more polished strategist in recent years last month , he and roach slowed regularly during mitt work , and pacquiao made suggestions that they incorporated on the spot koncz said pacquiao became a professor of boxing in his 2008 victory over oscar de la hoya as opposed to volume of punches , koncz said , pacquiao moves sideways , makes angles , with more intent and purpose roach taught pacquiao elusive tactics , blocking tactics and sidestepping tactics that he had never used before his style has become more nuanced , more advanced , his results a direct reflection of his evolution pacquiao , 32 , attributed that in part to age ariza credited the fighter s outside interests , all the chess and darts and political ambition , for heightened brain activity that , rather than distract pacquiao , helped him focus to beat the improved pacquiao , garcia and goossen said , would require a superb defensive performance , movement to match his movement , an offensive assault to force him backward and , simply , luck because of his defensive style and tactical brilliance , floyd mayweather jr poses the biggest threat as ariza surveys the boxing landscape , he sees fighters emulating pacquiao , or trying to they bounce like him , dance like him , shift like him but they are not as efficient , powerful , creative or balanced pacquiao boasts a style that is often imitated , never replicated ariza has long wanted to test pacquiao for scientific purposes , for lung capacity , red blood cells , endurance he could publish his findings in a scientific journal but pacquiao wants none of that part of his genius remains a mystery and always will bruce lee , ariza said , was like that
a floating , iridescent cloud of calligraphy is how the conceptual artist xu bing describes the living word , his installation of about 400 carved and painted acrylic chinese characters this summer , the living word 3 the latest version in a series that began in 2001 will rise to the highest point of the morgan library museum s glass atrium this will be only the second time contemporary artwork has been shown in the fiveyearold atrium , designed by renzo piano last summer , three large steel sculptures by mark di suvero appeared there at the morgan , text and image have equal weight , william m griswold , the morgan director , said so the pairing of an institution known for its outstanding collection of literary manuscripts with mr xu , an artist who embraces the written word as subject and medium both , is a natural the artist s mother was a librarian , and his father taught him calligraphy at an early age the living word 3 traces the chinese character for niao , meaning bird , from the current simplified version to its earliest written expression in ancient chinese officials at the morgan said that the artist chose the word because the installation is supposed to soar in a way that suggests escaping from the confines of its human , written definition visitors will be able to watch the installation beginning july 5 it is expected to be completed by july 15 and will be on view through sept 15 none of mr xu s living word installations have been seen in a new york city museum before one of the most visible chinese artists to begin working in the 1980s , he is now an international star exhibiting the work of mr xu is a continuation of the morgan s mission to strengthen its programs and acquisitions of art and objects from the 20th and 21st centuries recently the museum acquired the entire output of illustrated books by henri matisse all but three are a gift from frances and michael baylson , philadelphia collectors \( the morgan was able to buy the missing books through dealers in the united states and in france \) from 1914 until his death in 1954 , matisse took on more than 30 illustration projects sometimes he would be involved in the entire production of a book , from the illustrations through the typography other times he would illustrate the complete text of a book , and in still other cases he contributed only the frontispiece an exhibition of the whole collection is scheduled for 2015 the acquisition dovetails with the morgan s holdings , which include the archives from the artist s son , the dealer pierre matisse a chronicle of nine decades of 20thcentury art in new york they were a gift from the pierre matisse foundation in 1998 the matisse works are n't the only collection of books the morgan has acquired recently it also bought a collection devoted to the man booker prize , given annually to the best novel written in english by a citizen of the british commonwealth or ireland amassed by the london literary agent peter straus , the collection includes signed first editions , proofs , manuscripts , letters , judge s copies , promotional material and other ephemera john bidwell , who is in charge of prints and bindings at the morgan , hopes to keep adding to the collection , getting copies of all the shortlisted books and winners every year the likes taking exhibitions considered controversial or racy elsewhere after months of negotiations , it has confirmed that it will present hide seek difference and desire in american portraiture , an exhibition that closed in february at the national portrait gallery in washington the show , which examines gay and lesbian themes in american portraiture , drew attacks from republicans and religious conservatives over a fire in my belly , a fourminute video by david wojnarowicz \( pronounced voynahrohvitch \) that included an image of ants crawling on a plastic crucifix the image was interpreted as sacrilegious mr wojnarowicz , who died of aids in 1992 , created the piece when he was in mexico , where the crucifix had a special cultural meaning but critics of the video prevailed , and it was removed from the national gallery show , prompting accusations of censorship and causing other museums to display it along with other works by mr wojnarowicz the brooklyn museum will include the video in its version of the show , which will run nov 18 through feb 12 arnold l lehman , director of the brooklyn museum , said that the show would be almost the same in brooklyn as it was in washington \( except for the inclusion of the video \) after its brooklyn run , the show will head to the tacoma art museum , where it will be on view in march 2012 mr lehman said that the timing of hide seek is intentional it will run at the same time as youth and beauty age of the american twenties , which opens in october brooklyn will be the place to see american 20thcentury art this fall , he said while some eyebrows may be raised over the inclusion of a fire in my belly in the brooklyn showing of hide seek , few expect anything like the uproar that occurred in 1999 when sensation young british artists from the saatchi collection opened in brooklyn mayor rudolph w giuliani called the exhibition sick stuff and threatened to cut city subsidies because chris ofili s painting of the virgin mary included clumps of elephant dung few contemporary dealers have fascinated the art world as much as ileana sonnabend , whose ability to spot talents like jasper johns , robert rauschenberg , jeff koons and the british duo gilbert and george before anyone had heard of them made her something of a legend besides running the sonnabend gallery , she also assembled a personal collection some of it was sold by her heirs to pay estate taxes a year after her death in 2007 , but much of it remains intact now , from may 29 through oct 2 , the peggy guggenheim collection in venice is presenting ileana sonnabend an italian portrait , an exhibition featuring works from her holdings that have to do with italy organized by philip rylands , director of the peggy guggenheim collection , and antonio homem , sonnabend s son , who runs the sonnabend gallery , it will include more than 60 works there will be examples from italian artists like lucio fontana and piero manzoni , along with work from american artists like rauschenberg , warhol and cy twombly , who were inspired by the italian landscape and culture
7 15 pm updated san francisco after deliberating for about six hours , the jurors in barry bonds s perjury trial left the courthouse for the day , headed for a weekend off and a tough week ahead the panel eight women and four men did not return a verdict to end its first day of deliberations and the third week of the trial but throughout the day , it asked two questions that left the prosecutors and defense lawyers wondering which way the jury was leaning the jurors asked the judge for more information abut one piece of evidence a secretly recorded conversation from 2003 that captured greg anderson , bonds s former personal trainer , talking about injecting bonds they also asked to hear or read a transcript of the testimony of kathy hoskins , bonds s former personal shopper who said she had seen bonds receiving an injection from anderson both of those requests seemed to focus on at least one of the four charges against bonds , who is charged with lying to a grand jury in 2003 and with obstruction of justice one of the charges claims that bonds did not tell the truth when he testified that he never was injected by anyone but his personal doctor or a san francisco giants team trainer the jury will resume deliberations at 8 30 am monday6 04 pm updated after deliberating for less than three hours friday , the jurors in barry bonds s perjury case wanted clarification of one piece of evidence a secretly recorded conversation from 2003 that captured greg anderson , bonds s former personal trainer , talking about injecting bonds the conversation between steve hoskins , bonds s former business manager , and anderson is a crucial piece of evidence in the case , particularly when it comes to one of the four counts against bonds one of the charges against him is that he lied to a grand jury in 2003 when he said he never was injected by anyone but his personal doctor or a san francisco giants team trainer the jurors had asked the judge , susan illston of united states district court , for a copy of the full transcript of that conversation , which they had heard three weeks ago in court instead , though , the panel of eight women and four men were allowed only to listen to the recording in the courtroom each juror was given a transcript to help them decipher what was being said amid the background noise of the recording , but none of them could take that transcript back into the jury room they also had that transcript to look at when they heard the tape the first time it s meant only to assist you with what you 're hearing on the tape , illston said , as the jurors examined the pages put before them some appeared to be copying down the words from the transcript to a notebook bonds , 46 , is being charged with three counts of lying to a grand jury about his steroid use , and one count of obstruction of justice each count carries a maximum 10year prison sentence , but federal guidelines would call for a lighter sentence of 15 to 21 months if bonds was convicted ultimately , he would most likely serve much less time than that bonds s defense lawyers adamantly opposed letting the jurors see the transcript , which was not admitted into evidence only the recording had been admitted allen ruby , one of bonds s lawyers , said he was surprised that the judge was even considering allowing the jury to see the transcript for the court to allow it to be shown now would be an implied endorsement of their credibility , ruby said he was referring to hoskins and jeff novitzky , a special agent for the food and drug administration who ruby said had worked with hoskins to create the transcript but the judge pointed out to ruby that the jury had already seen the transcript , so she allowed the jurors to see it againso , again , it was played for all to hear as people in the courtroom strained to hear it amid the background noise of the giants' clubhouse on the recording , hoskins asked anderson , is that why barry did n't just shoot it in his butt all the time \? anderson replied oh , no i never just go there i move it all over the place he added that injections needed to be moved to different places on a person s body , so that no cysts would form anderson called those cysts gross and said some athletes even had to have surgery to remove them on the tape , anderson also explained , everything i 've been doing , at this point , it s all undetectable , and said that the substances he was using were the same used by the track star marion jones at the 2000 olympics during the threeweek trial , anderson would have been the government s star witness , but he was not among the 25 who testified for the prosecution he was in prison for refusing to testify in the case at about 10 am friday , illston ordered the release of anderson , who had been held for the past 17 days in a federal prison in dublin , calif , about 35 miles east of san francisco though his lawyers had asked for his release several times , illston waited until all witnesses had testified in the case and both sides gave closing arguments before letting the 45yearold anderson free anderson , federal inmate no 93389011 , was convicted in 2005 of conspiracy to distribute steroids and for money laundering in connection with the bay area laboratory cooperative drug case prosecutors said anderson gave bonds a clear , undetectable steroid and a testosterone cream , though bonds insisted anderson said those items were simply flaxseed oil and an arthritis balm anderson s release from a local prison came just hours before the san francisco giants played their home opener at att park , which is less than two miles from the courthouse before the game , the team planned to raise its world series championship flag at the stadium last year it won the world series for the first time in 56 years this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
for the next few weeks , i ll be writing about an idea that can make people healthier while bringing down health care costs , both in poor countries and in the united states the strategy is to move beyond doctors to take the work of health care and shift down from doctors and nurses to lay people , peers and family in the united states and other wealthy countries , lay people can fill in the gaps in left by doctors care in poor countries , people with no or little formal medical training are successfully substituting for doctors and nurses this is fortunate , as villagers in many developing countries rarely see doctors or nurses especially in englishspeaking parts of africa and south asia , doctors and nurses are often poached by better pay and conditions offered by canada , the united states , britain and australia half the doctors trained in ethiopia or zambia , for example , have emigrated \( and each doctor who goes from , say , kenya to britain represents a transfer of about 600 , 000 from a poor country to a wealthy one \) even doctors who don t leave the country tend to stay in cities , where they treat patients who can pay the distribution of nurses is only slightly more equitable rural villages do not tempt them but are doctors and nurses necessary to improve rural health \? two very successful programs in desperately poor parts of india s maharashtra state say no search \( the society for education , action and research in community health \) , in the district of gadchiroli , and the comprehensive rural health project , in the district of jamkhed , both recruit ordinary women to take care of their villages health they have had a huge impact on the health and prosperity of their villages the jamkhed program works with india s most downtrodden people its trainees are women , many of them members of the untouchable caste , many illiterate when i visited the program in 2008 , i met jamkhed health workers who are lepers and those who were married at the age of two and a half while leelabai amte is a highercaste maratha , not an untouchable , she was totally illiterate when she became a village health worker she has since learned to read and write she was married at 10 and had her first son at 13 today , however , she is a respected authority figure in her village of 6 , 000 people , halgaon amte was 60 when i met her , a very thin woman with thick glasses and no front teeth twice a day , at nine in the morning and six at night , she set off through the streets of halgaon , carrying a blood pressure cuff and a baby scale in her black shoulder bag , along with a log book she visited the newborns she had delivered , pregnant women , old people her first stop one morning in january was the home of a threedayold baby boy amte watched the baby suckle and then tied him in a cloth sling and hooked it to her scale he was three and a half kilos , nearly eight pounds a remarkable gain over his threekilo birth weight she murmured approvingly don t put anything on the umbilical cord , she said and keep the child in the sunlight in the morning twenty years ago , mothers waited three days to breastfeed their babies , she said a superstition that deprived babies of valuable colostrum and reduced the mothers supply of milk today , amte has banished this and dozens of other superstitions from halgaon when she started working in halgaon in 1977 , families had six or seven children the children often had scabies and other skin diseases they were unvaccinated and often sick night blindness due to vitamin a deficiency was everywhere tuberculosis and leprosy were common , and their sufferers were ostracized people attributed illness to curses from the gods today there is no more infant mortality , and tb and leprosy are gone mothers eat better the average birth weight of a baby has gone from about four and a half pounds to six and a half new mothers are taught how to feed and care for their babies children get regular immunizations now almost every mother knows how to treat diarrhea and fever at a busy corner in the center of town , amte was in the middle of a crowd of about 20 men , talking about installing toilets in halgaon s houses village women in india do not speak out to men , but amte does in the street she saw the husband of one of her pregnant patients a woman overdue for her prenatal visit to the program s hospital why is your wife not coming to the hospital \? she scolded him we ll check everything , give her blood tests the man had the grace to look sheepish i ve been busy with farming , he told amte next month i ll bring her all of the jamkhed women say that the most important thing they do is teach others amte has trained three village women to deliver babies at one house she quizzed a highschool girl if a child has a fever , what do you do \? amte asked cold compresses , said the girl promptly and diarrhea \? you give oral rehydration mixture do they teach you about health in school \? asked amte do they tell you about safe drinking water and keeping yourself clean \? no , the girl replied you are the one who talks about that the jamkhed program was founded in 1970 by raj and mabelle arole mabelle \( who died in 1997 \) and raj were first and second in their class respectively at a prestigious indian medical school they shared not only medical talent , but a dissatisfaction with the kind of medicine they were being taught curative medicine , the kind useful for wealthy countries they moved back to jamkhed , near where raj was born , a location they chose largely for its desolation they decided that doctors were not the way to help rural villages the vast majority of sickness in rural areas could be prevented with clean water , wastedisposal systems and more diverse farming villages need to end deadly superstitions about health they need to end discrimination against women and untouchables , and to learn about handwashing , nutrition , breastfeeding and simple home remedies doctors do none of these things rural problems are simple , raj arole told me we do not need experts an array of women like village health workers is enough , properly trained and supported the very prestige and distance of doctors worked against them the aroles found that lack of education was an advantage for village health workers they knew how their neighbors lived and thought the aroles went to various villages and asked each to choose a woman to send to the program s headquarters in jamkhed , which is also the name of the district s major city , to learn to be a health worker mabelle and the couple s daughter , shobha , now a doctor who runs the program , conducted the training teaching the women health skills was the easy part illiteracy was not an overwhelming problem the real problem was the women s complete absence of confidence their entire lives had been lessons in keeping their heads down they had to gain confidence from each other amte and many of the other active health workers gather at the jamkhed campus every tuesday they discuss problems in their village and learn about new health subjects new health workers go in groups of three or four to stay with more experienced peers in their village for a week they watch their mentor as she greets her neighbors with assurance , works with local allmen farmers clubs , sees patients and teaches mothers about breastfeeding or purifying water starting out , none of the women could imagine that their neighbors would ever listen to their advice there was no magic in it the answer turned out to be the expected factors time , demonstrable success and support there were months , sometimes years of frustration , tempered by the soothing words of more experienced health workers who had gone through the same thing but eventually , mothers of sick children called the jamkhed worker out of desperation , when going to the temple didn t work their success in curing a child s diarrhea or delivering a baby after a difficult labor was the turning point after that , people started listening when they talked about clean water , breastfeeding and nutrition as well indian statistics have long shown that jamkhed villages are far healthier than their neighbors a new study published in the bulletin of the world health organization found that jamkhed s program has reduced child deaths by 30 percent but had no significant effect on neonatal deaths those in the first month of life search , by contrast , focuses on more traditional medicine like jamkhed , search was founded by a husbandandwife team of indian doctors who studied public health at johns hopkins university in baltimore , abhay and rani bang but there are differences search is newer , founded in 1985 it requires its health workers to have more education literacy at least , and some of the women have finished 10 th grade search trains them to work with mothers in their homes to have healthy children the health workers visit pregnant women repeatedly , attend births , teach mothers about how to keep their babies healthy and check in on the children often they diagnose and treat illnesses , and even administer injectable antibiotics to treat blood infections the bangs carry out numerous studies of their work in 1999 , they published an article in the medical journal lancet , showing that their homebased care program reduced neonatal and infant mortality by 50 percent that caught the attention of the connecticutbased humanitarian agency save the children neonatal mortality was an important and neglected health issue , said david oot , associate vice president for health and nutrition at save the children but the deaths occur at home without exposure to the formal health system so people thought there was little you could do search proved there was a lot you could do for the past 10 years , search has worked with save the children to study new ways community health workers can work with mothers , and teach these methods to others on saturday , i will look at what makes jamkhed and search so successful when similar programs have failed elsewhere , and how their ideas are

sydney , australia whether by phone , text or in person , bill haas conducts a postround analysis of his play with his father , jay , a professional golfer for more than 30 years the tradition dates to bill s rookie year only months after turning pro , he flashed signs of his potential at the 2004 deutsche bank championship entering the final round in third place and paired with tiger woods , he called the one person he knew had been there , done that so you 're playing with the man , jay haas said he told his son that s good just remember that you 're the man , too such fatherly wisdom has a way of lifting his son s spirits he always seems to say the right thing , bill said when the presidents cup is held at royal melbourne golf club this week , bill , 29 , will not have to worry about an expensive phone bill or the time difference when seeking fatherly advice jay , 57 , is one of the united states team s assistant captains to fred couples it is the first time a father has coached a son in the presidents cup , a biennial competition between a team of 12 americans and 12 international golfers by capturing the tour championship and the fedex cup in september , bill has staked his claim to being the most successful son of a tour pro in the modern era the golf roots of the haas family tree stretch back further bob goalby , the patriarch of this golfing clan , won 11 pga tour titles , including jay s younger brother , jerry , is a former walker cup player and tour member , and the at wake forest for the last 15 years jay s brotherinlaw , dillard pruitt , claimed one victory during an eightyear tour career and has spent the last 13 seasons as a rules official and the caddie who handed bill his wedge to save par during the tour championship playoff \? none other than bill s older brother , jay jr , an aspiring pro jay jr will not be on his brother s bag for the presidents cup because he is at home tending to the latest addition to the haas family tree , a girl born thursday there are a lot of branches to this tree , pruitt said the family s golf story began when an 8yearold goalby crossed the railroad tracks between his home and the country club a mere 50 yards away goalby , 82 , grew up in belleville , ill , and started caddying at in 1938 later he became a member there and introduced the game to his nephew jay haas when jay was 5 , goalby wrapped a leather grip around a cutdown 4wood and out they went to the backyard to hit whiffle balls he swung it pretty well , goalby said by age 7 , jay won the national pee wee championship he shagged balls and caddied for his uncle , absorbing his many lessons goalby helped jay land a golf scholarship at wake forest , where he won the as the college golfer of the year in 1975 goalby did more than give jay his first club and get him a full ride as a former champion of the heritage golf classic , goalby persuaded tournament organizers to grant a sponsor s exemption in april 1977 for jay , then a tour rookie that week in harbour town , sc , jay met his future wife , jan pruitt , a florida state student vacationing on spring break i remember noticing this girl in the crowd , jay said turns out she had placed a bet on me in the neighborhood pool after asking her dad , who is a young , upandcoming noname \? her longshot pick held the firstround lead one day later , jay spotted the same blonde in his gallery and asked a friend to get her number they went out that night he did not win the tournament and she lost the betting pool , but a year later , they married so i guess i was involved in that , too , goalby said jay and represented the united states on three ryder cup and two presidents cup teams he is active on the champions tour , collecting his 15th title this season bill was born in 1982 , the second of five children , and grew up chipping and putting on the artificial green in the family s backyard in south carolina haas s game blossomed at wake forest , where he played for his uncle jerry and followed in his father s footsteps , sweeping a number of college golfer of the year honors in 2004 since turning pro , haas has made steady progress he broke through with his first tour title at the 2010 bob hope classic , the same trophy his father lifted in 1988 bill credited a pretournament swing tip from his father and great uncle for the victory , which made bill and jay the eighth fatherson combination to win on the tour this year , bill set his sights higher , aiming for a spot on the presidents cup team but making the team as one of two wildcard choices seemed unlikely unless he made a big impression at the tour championship , the last tournament before the picks were announced goalby s eyes were glued to the telecast as bill surged into the lead on the final day , only to slip back into a playoff with hunter mahan when bill s 150yard approach shot from a fairway bunker drifted left , bounced off the embankment and into the water on the second playoff hole , goalby departed the living room in disgust heck , i thought it was over and done , goalby said but he returned just in time to watch one of the defining golf shots of 2011 with his ball partly submerged , haas splashed from the water and spun his ball to a stop about 2 feet from the hole and salvaged par one hole later , he , the fedex cup and a combined 1144 million the next day , couples selected haas for the presidents cup team and so the family legacy continues to grow the generation making the latest memories is grateful for what he calls his biggest luxury as a pro everything i 've ever achieved in this game is because of my dad and family , bill said
the veterinarian hired by the thoroughbred retirement foundation to evaluate the health of its herd says if the rescue group is to survive it must greatly reduce the number of horses it cares for , increase its financial support to the farms where they live and work with smaller organizations to retrain the horses for a second career in equestrian competitions or so they can be adopted dr stacey huntington , a veterinarian based in springfield , mo , made the recommendation in a fourpage report based on her examination of nearly 860 of the foundation s horses she was supposed to evaluate more than 1 , 100 horses but was last month after finding that many of the horses were malnourished and neglected some had died and that the foundation s education of caretakers and its oversight of their farms were poor huntington s report says that 98 percent of the horses she examined lacked basic care like dental , vaccination , deworming and farrier care , and that 380 had less than ideal body condition scores , according to the trf s standards the foundation , which is based in saratoga springs , ny , and is supported by pillars of the racing establishment , had a 12 million deficit in 2009 , according to its most recent federal tax filings , and has admitted it fell behind by months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in paying its caretakers i believe that a good group of volunteers and other smaller rescue organizations will help to ease the trf s burden if only to help the horses , huntington wrote but trf has to recognize that their problems are of their own making only a 180degree shift in attitude can help this organization survive tom ludt , the foundation s board chairman , acknowledged receiving the report but questioned the findings , saying the group was completing its review with other veterinarians we are finalizing our evaluations and continue to move forward with total review of our herd , he wrote in an email thursday calling huntington s evaluation of the herd incomplete , ludt said that she had changed her opinions and that some of her findings were disputed by a veterinarian i have not changed my opinions , huntington said by telephone on thursday the photographs of individual reports speak for themselves i had local veterinarians with me at each farm and they have not disagreed executors of the estate of the breeder and owner paul mellon , one of the foundation s largest benefactors , have reviewed huntington s recommendations and her documentation , including photographic evidence they initiated the evaluation last december after receiving complaints about the care of the horses , and have paid more than 50 , 000 over the past several months for veterinary fees , food and urgent care for the horses it s a thorough , straightforward report with a lot of very good ideas of how to take care of these horses , said beverly carter , an executor of the mellon estate , which provided a 5 million endowment for the foundation and later contributed an additional 2 million things have got to change for the sake of the horses the foundation was created in 1982 by an advertising executive , monique koehler , and grew into one of the world s largest horse rescue organizations ten years ago , it was in full swing , taking in more than 1 , 000 horses from 2001 to 2005 , but at the same time straining its thin resources when the economy collapsed in 2008 and donations plunged , the foundation was burdened with a young herd that needed continuing care by spring 2010 , the situation was so dire that the board debated whether publicizing a threat to kill off some of its herd would help or hurt fundraising efforts what we avoided that day was a serious adult conversation about whether or not we would follow up on our threat , and euthanize 200 horses to get the trf herd to a more manageable number that could be sustained financially , ray paulick , a member of the executive board , on his web site , paulick report about the same time , complaints about the foundation reached jacque schultz , senior director of the aspca equine fund , which had committed 350 , 000 over two years schultz said she met with the foundation s executive director , diana pikulski , last april , and requested copies of veterinary inspections reports when the foundation failed to come up with them , schultz said she met with pikulski again in november and told her the foundation would have to obtain accreditation from the global federation of animal sanctuaries if it was to receive its second year of financing , also worth 175 , 000 they promised that by december 31 , 2010 , we would receive the requested veterinary inspection reports , schultz said in a statement by early march 2011 , they had not made any progress on their application for accreditation and we still had not received the promised veterinary reports she added we 're very disappointed in trf s animal care oversight and that they were not adhering to operational best practices while huntington wrote that should be based only on quality of life issues , she noted that more than 725 of the horses she examined were younger than 17 , and that more than half of them were retraining prospects she recommended the foundation work more cooperatively and aggressively with other rescue groups to find appropriate homes for the horses care of a horse costs about 2 , 300 a year , and many of the more than 20 satellite farms are receiving 3 a day , or less than half of what they need huntington recommended limiting the number of horses to 50 per farm , which would reduce injuries and allow more personal attention from caretakers raising the per diem to 4 and paying on time the caretakers are responsible for purchasing the feed and providing direct care for the horses , the monthly payments to them must be a priority , she wrote huntington s report is also critical of the foundation s oversight of its facilities , and the education of its caretakers it recommends removing horses from one farm in oklahoma , and another in kentucky , where horses were in such poor shape the mellon estate is paying for veterinary oversight at an adoption center in virginia , for example , huntington said that the foundation was paying for barn use but that none of its horses were being stalled there they were being left outside after her inspection , 12 of the foundation s 63 horses were referred for urgent care it cannot be overemphasized that decreasing the herd size is paramount to having trf continue as an organization , she wrote
television in the 1950s was still something relatively new and strange but nowhere was it stranger or funnier than in the shows of ernie kovacs like all of the marx brothers rolled into one , kovacs , armed with just a cigar , peppered the airwaves pellmell as he took on the intimate but intimidating new medium he casually wrought chaos with an unpredictable mix of skits and bits , and an easy mastery of those inbetween moments that make or break a tv host previously a radio announcer , the irrepressible kovacs \( born in trenton and of hungarian descent \) worked on a string of shows at a range of networks , long available mostly on a chunky vhs collection and a choppy dvd sampler before home video , archives of kovacs s work were in danger of being destroyed until his widow and righthand comic , edie adams , took steps to conserve his legacy and , fortunately for the contemporary viewer , shout ! factory has just released a sixdisc set that bursts selected by the film historian ben model , the ernie kovacs collection covers 1950 to 1962 , from kovacs s beginnings in philadelphia to the stationhopping that , interrupted by a hollywood stint , climaxed with his abc specials \( up to his death in a 1962 car accident \) whether on a sketch program or an ostensible game show like the absurd , cluedriven take a good look , kovacs was always the real main event , aiming to surprise , entertain and , perhaps above all , play he was cerebral , surreal and silly all at the same time , said ron simon , curator of television and radio at the paley center for media , which hosted a panel discussion about kovacs last month he was able to combine high culture and the low culture of vaudeville in the blender of his mind and television kovacs himself called his onscreen exploits part comedy , part experiment he gave news bulletins from ancient rome , kibitzed on the air with staffers off screen , sent a car crashing through the floor , deployed oscilloscopes and kaleidoscopes and matting effects , staged , parodied other shows from superman s to edward r murrow s , and even laced the credit roll with jokes and then there was that master class in comic timing , three expressionless gorillas in long coats playing robert maxwell s solfeggio , an insipid tune that , to slowburn frustration , invariably involved drumsticktocranium percussion kovacs loved to incorporate the unexpected into his programs , and when a cue card was held too far away to read , or a horse for the next sketch was making too much noise , he 'd comment on it he reminded people , hey , we 're making this , and it s not just a fantasy , it s a reality for us' in doing that he quickly dismantled tv just as it was being invented , said joel hodgson , creator of the moviemocking showcase that traces its cardboard sets to kovacs s fondness for lowbudget props and costumes he contextualized tv in a way that no one had done with a broad smile and a mischievous crook to his eyebrows , kovacs made his way through each show with good humor and a generally relaxed pace he 'd sooner make fun of a gag than give it the hard sell that genial informality , combined with metareferences \( what are we plugging now \? \) , left its mark on other talk shows when david letterman rolled out a segment like hal gurnee s network time killers on his 1980s late night show , he surely owed inspiration to kovacs , who once spontaneously counted off 60 seconds of live airtime ernie would be making wisecracks about his own bits as he did them , merrill markoe , the head writer of late night when it started , wrote in an email ms markoe recalled visiting the paley center , then the museum of broadcasting , with mr letterman to watch shows they had grown up with and admired , including those of kovacs and steve allen \( kovacs and mr letterman used the same announcer , bill wendell , who was also generally a straight man for kovacs \) when we first started doing dave s show , right off the bat a lot of what ernie kovacs had been doing came into play , ms markoe wrote late night and rowan martin s laughin , which built on the blackout sketches kovacs pioneered , are two of many descendants , along with saturday night live , sesame street , monty python s flying circus and the seminal soho publicaccess program the live ! show , not to mention the longacknowledged influence on video artists like nam june paik the free spirit and visual playfulness of kovacs s shows have inspired others as much as the comedy , which was not always laughoutloud hilarious jolene brand , a kovacs regular in the 1960s , recalled his conversations with her husband , george schlatter , a creator of laughin he would run some of his ideas by george , and george would say , it s great , ernie , but where s the punch line \? ' and he 'd say , it does n't need a punch line , ' said ms brand , best known for a recurring bit in a bathtub that proved full of surprises \( i loved doing the tub \) a wordless poker game acted out to beethoven , for example , has its comic appeal , but the synchronization was just as impressive for demonstrating kovacs s experimentation with sound and image sticking to his interests across shows and stations , kovacs in some ways resembled a oneman comedic auteur of cinema like jerry lewis \( whose first solo tv show kovacs once memorably upstaged \) his zeal for tinkering never stopped , and no less an admirer than martin scorsese once claimed to have learned much from watching kovacs destroy beautifully the form of what you were used to thinking was the television comedy show but none of kovacs s antics would have succeeded without his basic affability for all the satirizing of his televisual home , the tube did prove remarkably good at making you feel as if you were paying a visit to the odd but friendly world of mr kovacs he was just a really great broadcaster , really funny and really genuinely warm , mr hodgson said he was the kind of person you 'd like to spend time with
minsk , belarus the head of s security services suggested tuesday that members of the country s embattled opposition might have been behind on monday that killed 12 people and wounded 150 at a subway station close to the office of the country s authoritarian president , aleksandr g lukashenko vadim zaitsev , the head of the security services still called the kgb in this former soviet republic indicated that the bombers might have had links to the organizers of a large protest against mr lukashenko in december you know that there were events recently , and not all people who have been held responsible or investigated by the prosecutors and the courts agree with the decisions of those courts , mr zaitsev said on government television , apparently referring to the december protest he suggested that members of exceedingly radical extremist youth groups could have carried out the bombing as revenge and warned that they might be plotting similar attacks against law enforcement officials he offered no evidence to support his claim mr zaitsev s remarks seemed to confirm the fears of several opposition leaders , expressed soon after the bombing , that the authorities could use the attack as a pretext to broaden an already extensive  political tensions have been heightened since the december protest , when tens of thousands of people converged on a central square here in the capital to denounce what they considered fraud in an election that mr lukashenko had easily won hundreds were arrested when the police violently dispersed the largely peaceful rally authorities have accused the organizers , including several former presidential candidates , of plotting a coup they could face up to 15 years in prison there are those today who do not like the way of life in belarus or the belarussian security structure , mr zaitsev said they are looking for changes that will exacerbate the situation by spreading fear , panic and distrust of law enforcement agencies and government organs in the wake of the bombing , the authorities appear to have increased the pressure on opposition figures four kgb agents accompanied by the police went to the offices of an opposition newspaper , nasha niva , on tuesday and ordered it to remove video of the bombing from its site and the prosecutor general s office sent warnings to several opposition leaders , accusing them of discrediting belarussian society and the government in their remarks about the attack , on the prosecutor s web site said a different explanation of the bombing has been proposed by several opposition leaders that mr lukashenko and his security services may have been behind it though no one has offered evidence to support the suspicion , it has begun to enter into hushed conversations in kitchens and courtyards here everyone has the same theory , said lada , a 40yearold doctor who would not give her last name it is a good excuse to declare a state of emergency and press the opposition , she said , referring to the attack few , however , seem so certain the attack appears to have flabbergasted most here in minsk , a city of about 18 million people kept in lockstep by the robust security services i was always so happy that we had a small country and a small city where everything was peaceful and quiet and nothing ever happened , said diana bukhalko , 20 who would want to attack minsk \? it was a question many here were having trouble answering as they gathered outside the oktyabrskaya subway station on tuesday to place flowers and pay their respects to the victims there have been bombings before in minsk , at an outdoor festival that wounded dozens but nothing has ever reached the scale of monday s bloodshed packed with at least 10 pounds of explosives as well as metal balls and nails , the bomb tore off limbs and sent shrapnel straight through bodies when it was detonated , investigators said the bomb , which was placed under a bench at the subway station , was set off by remote control anatoly kuleshov , belarus s interior minister , told journalists that investigators had come up with a composite sketch of two people suspected in the bombing belarussian news agencies , citing the nation s deputy prosecutor general , said several suspects had been detained none were publicly identified on tuesday
representative barney frank of massachusetts announced thursday that he would seek reelection in 2012 , ending speculation about whether he would time his retirement with the state s loss of a congressional seat to redistricting mr frank , 70 , said in a statement that he wanted more time in office to help defend democratic legislation like the doddfrank act , the sweeping financial reform law he coauthored last year the law is already under attack by those who oppose meaningful regulation and who would undermine it , mr frank s statement said i intend to do everything in my power to fight their efforts mr frank s announcement complicates things for the state s house delegation , which is made up of 10 democrats but is slated to lose a seat in the next election due to the rate of its population growth if none of the others voluntarily give up their seat , two will have to run against each other in 2012 one possibility is that a house member will cede his seat to challenge senator scott brown , whose term is up next year representatives michael capuano of somerville and stephen lynch of south boston have both expressed interest in challenging mr brown , a republican who last year won the seat that the late senator edward kennedy had held for almost 50 years mr frank , who was elected to congress in 1980 , faced the toughest reelection challenge of his career last fall but still won by a comfortable margin he represents the state s 4th district , which includes wealthy boston suburbs like newton and brookline but also the hardluck cities of new bedford and fall river mr frank s announcement came just as the us census bureau is starting to release detailed new data that will help the redistricting process get underway nationally
baghdad s political leaders announced late tuesday that they had agreed on the need to keep american military trainers in iraq next year , but they declared that any remaining troops should not be granted immunity from iraqi law , a point the united states has said would be a deal breaker the statement , issued as the political leaders emerged from a meeting in the presidential compound , sent mixed signals as united states officials and the iraqi cabinet negotiate whether any troops will remain after the first of the year , when the forces are scheduled to depart american officials were scrambling on tuesday night to decipher the announcement less than three months before the last troops are scheduled to leave close to 40 , 000 members of the military are in the country americans are increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of the discussions the united states has called for a prompt decision , noting the logistical hurdles of moving ahead on a withdrawal while making contingency plans to leave some troops behind the meeting of iraq s political leadership , which concluded around 10 pm , was attended by prime minister nuri kamal almaliki president jalal talabani mr maliki s chief rival , ayad allawi and several other highranking officials ali aldabbagh , the government spokesman , issued a statement saying the leaders had agreed that there was no need to grant immunity to trainers , rather ambiguous phrasing for a dealbreaking demand the spokeswoman for mr allawi s iraqiya bloc , maysoon aldamluji , said the leaders had pressed mr maliki for his stance on granting the troops immunity eventually , ms damluji said , we agreed on the necessity of having american training troops , and we agreed to not grant them immunity mr dabbagh , the government spokesman , said any training from the americans should help iraq maintain the security of its borders , waterways and airspace , which american military leaders have said the iraqis need help protecting an official for the united states embassy in iraq said the americans were reviewing the statement and appreciate the democratic spirit displayed by iraqi leaders in debating this important subject the issue is far from settled and will most likely be subject to further behindthescenes negotiations in the coming weeks , just as the troop withdrawal accelerates immunity strikes a deep nerve among ordinary iraqis because it would mean that american troops could not be prosecuted in iraq the issue evokes some of the worst horrors of the war here , from the abu ghraib prison scandal to the killing of civilians by blackwater mercenaries but it is also important to the united states to shield troops working in good faith under difficult and dangerous conditions earlier this year , american officials considered a plan to allow significant numbers of troops to stay in iraq under diplomatic authority , which was essentially an end run around the need for a new security agreement and parliamentary debate about immunity for iraqis , that idea evoked memories of mercenaries operating with impunity and sometimes killing civilians the idea was shelved after a central intelligence agency operative in pakistan who held a diplomatic passport was accused of murder , touching off an international controversy about the meaning of diplomatic immunity that case prompted american government lawyers to insist that parliament approve immunity for soldiers in iraq american security contractors , thousands of whom are flooding into the country to support an expanded state department mission , are technically subject to iraqi law , but none have ever been held criminally liable in iraq even now , the united states government occasionally , and secretly , removes contractors from the country when they are accused of crimes the meeting was the iraqi leadership s fourth about keeping troops in iraq little was accomplished in the first two , but in the third , on aug 2 , the leaders agreed to negotiate with the united states about keeping troops a little more than a month later , it was reported that officials in washington had supported a plan to keep 3 , 000 to 5 , 000 troops in iraq
all through the baseball playoffs , mike tanier will provide the bats blog with daily updates on lessthanimportant developments from around the league his phillies homerism is no longer an issue bobby thomson bill mazeroski kirk gibson nelson cruz you never know who will hit a historic home run , or when one will be hit , though the bottom of the 11th inning of a playoff game is a great time to look for them cruz s gamewinning grand slam might not be remembered with some of the greatest hits of yesteryear the tigers could come back from two down to take the pennant but it is the first walkoff grand slam in major league playoff history , so at the very least it will live forever in trivia question form as monday night drama goes , we ll take an 11th inning grand slam over whatever is happening on house , or the bears and lions striving to commit 25 penalties before halftime on monday night football because cruz s home run may still be talked about 50 years from now , the new york times would like to immortalize the act in the kind of resounding baseball prose that echoes across generations and stirs the imaginations of fans not yet born but since none of our really good writers are available to update the blog , they are letting me take a whack at it setting the scene ryan perry is on the mound for the tigers michael young is on third base he singled past the diving reach of third baseman don kelly , who was playing down the line to protect the corners adrian beltre is on second he singled to center mike napoli is on first his single fell between right fielder andy dirks and center fielder austin jackson , skipping off dirks glove and bouncing off jackson s hip fox television has displayed a last walkoff hit graphic under each batter , establishing a kind of permajinx that suggests that they want the game to last forever anything to not have to broadcast another episode of house the at bat nelson cruz steps to the plate , his left leg cocked back to the edge of the batter s box , his stance upright he takes a vicious rip at an offspeed pitch , fouling it straight back while pinwheeling in the box and taking several hops toward the first base line no one told cruz that a bloop single wins the game no one told him that a sacrifice fly wins the game , or that a slow roller that just gets past the mound wins the game or perhaps someone told him and he did not listen , because cruz clearly believes that the only way to win the game is to hit the ball 650 feet to left field perry s second pitch is a belthigh fastball cruz rips it foul down the third base line fox shows a cruz highlight montage from the game in the seventh inning , he homered off the left field foul pole to tie the game in the ninth , he was hit in the wrist and chest by a jose valverde pitch cruz is shown grimacing and crumpling to the ground from three gratuitous angles , as if the play were a car explosion in a jeanclaude van damme movie tigers catcher alex avila calls timeout crowd reaction shots are the heart and soul of televised baseball the camera cuts to a woman looking down at her rangers 2010 american league champions teeshirt the shirt shows michael young and other stars in yellowish sepiatoned images , as if they are taken from old newspaper clippings it is probably a heck of a shirt closeup , but from a distance it looks like the poor woman spilled just spilled a beer perry wastes a breaking ball in the dirt it is not a waste , really the way cruz has been corkscrewing on pitches , that could have been strike three if it broke a little later but cruz lays off it a reaction shot of ron washington reminds us that either the revolution in men s eyewear fashion has passed the rangers manager by , or he is far , far ahead of it perry throws a 12 slider it hangs , reaching the plate near the inside corner and just above cruz s knees it is a ball perry would like to have back , and he may get it if it ever lands cruz turns on it framebyframe analysis of the replay shows cruz admiring his work from the moment it leaves his bat , avila dropping to one knee and following the ball s path with resigned ah , well body language , and infielders watching the arc of the ball with a clear understanding that there is no need to go cover any bases the celebration napoli throws his batting helmet high into the air as he rounds third somewhere , brandon jacobs mutters to himself cruz bowls his batting helmet into a throng of teammates , hoping for a 710 split close examination of the replay shows several teammates egging cruz on to bowl the helmet , possibly because they do not want to be hit with it when it lands ian kinsler grabs elvis andrus from behind and lifts him so he is directly in the path of the rolling helmet this must be a clubhouse hobby for the rangers bowling for andrus mark lowe douses cruz with a cup of water , splashing the television camera in the process to create a few magical moments of players celebrating through a haze of water droplets it takes a special kind of person to decide that the proper way to congratulate a teammate upon doing something incredibly important is to throw a cup of water at him there is a second splash of water visible on the replays , but after 20 minutes of framebyframe analysis , i could not find its origin this second splasher theory will haunt me for weeks perhaps napoli s helmet landed in a nearby jug of gatorade and this is how you avoid a onerun win , jack buck says over the replay were the rangers trying to avoid a onerun win \? avoiding wins of any kind is a rather strange concept in sports buck may have been thrown off his game by the fact that terry francona had his arm around him during the extrainning broadcast booth cutaways rangers general manager jon daniels hugs his wife nolan ryan highfives a fan and makes a happy face no one quite makes a happy face like ryan , who came across as a little dour when he was a pitcher his eyes light up , his chin drops to below his shoulders , and his top lip curls up so all of his teeth are visible he looks like a giddy jackolantern carved by a kindergarten teacher who does not want anything scary in the classroom finally , a brief interview with cruz , now wearing shaving cream all over his face and smiling so wide that his braces are visible the following update is posted on the facebook page

representative ron paul of texas has none of the typical attributes of a successful presidential candidate , except one he can raise money according to mr paul s web site , his oneday money bomb aimed at collecting funds during thursday s republican debate netted his campaign more than 1 million for a shoestring campaign like mr paul s , that will finance a lot mr paul does not have an army of highpriced consultants or a fancy campaign headquarters one million dollars is sure to keep mr paul in the campaign throughout the summer a selfdescribed contrarian , mr paul does not typically pander to the republican establishment or the primary electorate he says things that are unpopular with most republicans \( like his opposition to the wars in iraq and afghanistan \) and he ignores the political dangers of talking about slashing social programs for the poor and elderly but that approach seems to encourage his supporters to open their wallets in december 2007 , mr paul hosted a oneday fundraising event in boston , tied to the anniversary of the boston tea party he raised more than 6 million this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo representative ron paul was in greenville , sc , on thursday for the first republican debate of the 2012 race \( photograph by richard shiro associated press \)
if a delicate balance exists in the chemistry that makes tnt s inside the nba a successful and amusing studio program , will a huge new ingredient named shaquille o neal alter it \? the camaraderie that binds charles barkley , kenny smith and ernie johnson as a team is difficult to imitate as espn has shown so why try to change the chemical balance \? the answer because shaq exists o neal can be charming and funny , but whether he will equal barkley s outrageousness is unknown o neal is also surprisingly softspoken for a man of his dimensions barkley s voice matches his size we re going to make it very fun , o neal said on a conference call thursday we re going to make it more exciting for the fans to watch he said he religiously watched inside as a player , which probably gave tnt an edge over espn s bid , as did the fact that he owns a house near atlanta , where tnt is based o neal had one meeting with espn , where the network laid out its plans and salary for him but turner won a week later , o neal called john skipper , espn s executive vice president of content , to say \( according to skipper \) , i respect you guys too much to put you through a long process the deal with turner to be a fulltime analyst also includes a development deal with its entertainment and animation networks with aspirations to work in law enforcement , o neal could turn up on tnt s southland or memphis beat series , or star in a cartoon series but he will not revive his title character in the 1996 film kazaam in a cartoon series kazaam s back in the bottle , he said no kazaam jokes smith has already dubbed o neal the big analytical , which lacks the intellectual heft or grandeur of the big aristotle , the big cactus , shaq fu and shaq daddy and with that sort of nickname , you might expect big and brilliant analyses his first shot at analyzing monthold news the dallas mavericks defeat of the miami heat in the nba finals was mediocre the heat just came up against a team , and it was their turn , he said , adding that the mavericks dirk nowitzki played unbelievably his assessment of the current state of the center in the nba without himself and the newly retired yao ming was more insightful the beasts are now gone , he said the goliaths are now gone that leaves dwight howard out there by himself if he doesn t get two or three championships , i m disappointed because he has no competition out there anymore none zero
when federal and state environmental regulators spent a few days at lake calumet in chicago earlier this month fishing for asian carp with and halfmilewide nets , their hunt seemed to underscore the carp s status as the midwest s ecological enemy no 1 the subject of endless debate over the best control strategies , asian carp , an , have earned a place of dread in local lore none , however , were found in the lake calumet search , and some scientists say the ecological concerns may be overblown for many people , asian carp are proving more boon than bane bolstered by government support , the asian carp harvest has leapt thirtyfold in the past decade , creating a new industry , attracting fishermen and entrepreneurs , and feeding people all over the world we 've been ramping up for years , said mike schafer , owner of schafer fisheries in 2010 , the company sold some 20 million pounds of asian carp to clients as farflung as turkey and indonesia , up from two million pounds in 2006 we 're out in front , mr schafer said , and it s going to get bigger in the last year , illinois has handed out nearly 6 million to increase the catch of asian carp in the illinois river , including a 2 million grant to the big river fish corporation , of downstate pearl , to expand operations and ship up to 50 million pounds a year to china a separate 3 million state program aims to further increase the harvest of bighead and silver carp , the two asian carp species that have infested the mississippi , illinois and ohio rivers and are nearing the great lakes both species reproduce quickly , gorge on plankton , a key food for native american fishes , and grow up to 100 pounds kirby marsden , former president of the illinois commercial fishermen s association and a parttime consultant for big river fish , estimates that the carp harvest , less than half a million pounds in 2000 , could grow to an annual catch of 100 million pounds that creates up to 200 new jobs in the next few years it s a chance to get rid of this invasive fish , boost the local economy and increase employment in this area , mr marsden said imported in the 1970 s by fish farmers and government agencies to keep southern fish ponds clean , bighead and silver carp escaped their enclosures during flooding and migrated to the mississippi river , then on to the illinois and ohio river basins though they now represent 8 out of every 10 fish in some stretches of the illinois river , said greg sass , director of the illinois river biological survey at the university of illinois , urbanachampaign , scientific research has yet to establish a direct connection between the asian carp proliferation and the decline of any native species while scientists debate whether asian carp could spawn in the great lakes and imperil the lakes' 7 billion fishing industries , environmental groups and politicians from six states have called for reseparating chicago area waterways from the mississippi river the asian carp regional coordinating committee , a task force of more than 20 state , federal and regional officials , is exploring a less drastic measure increasing the harvest on the illinois river in sufficient quantities to slow the carp s advance toward lake michigan it s no panacea , said joel brammeier , president of the alliance for the great lakes but in the short run it makes sense getting those fish out of the water reduces that northward pressure on lake michigan and buys us some time to come up with a permanent solution jim garvey , director of the fisheries and illinois aquaculture center at southern illinois university , runs the 3 million state program to increase the carp harvest and develop commercial markets he says asian carp , though a hard sell for human appetites in the united states , are among the most widely consumed fish in the world , with china the biggest market it would be silly for our country to have us spend taxpayer dollars to eradicate these things and throw them in a landfill , mr garvey said we might as well make some money out of them orion briney , a thirdgeneration illinois river fisherman , agrees while mr briney hauls in up to 20 , 000 pounds of asian carp six days a week , the fish industry has shrunk from a few decades ago , when hundreds of commercial fishermen fished the illinois today , maybe a couple dozen fishermen work fulltime mr garvey and his team are hoping to double that number with a pilot program set to begin next month after as many as 25 fishermen are trained to properly catch and handle asian carp , the state will pay cash awards to those who haul in a certain amount a few hundred yards from the mississippi river , in thomson , ill , schafer fisheries had dealt solely in catfish for most of its 55 years now , asian carp represent 80 percent of the company s business , mr schafer said schafer ships frozen , filleted , and minced carp mostly to international markets and asian communities in the united states it also offers asian carp jerky , hot dogs and bouillabaisse , and converts waste material into liquid organic fertilizer one of mr schafer s main competitors , stoller fisheries of spirit lake , iowa , ships about two million pounds of asian carp each year the owner , larry stoller , says he hopes to increase that number by half next year inland processing , a startup in grafton , ill , is pitching the state and investors on plans for a plant to process up to 15 million pounds of asian carp a year big river fish , meanwhile , is using its state grant to build an 80 , 000squarefoot plant to open this fall and increase its processing capacity to 25 million pounds a month by 2013 from the current 180 , 000 pounds a month competitors have questioned the state award to big river fish because the company s director of international marketing , ross harano , was state director of trade from 2003 to 2005 a state official said mr harano s background with the state did not influence the grant decision select logistics network of clinton , ill , recently won its own state contract 1 million to remove about three million pounds of asian carp from the illinois river and process it into fish meal heartland processing , a startup in havana , ill , is looking to turn carp waste into omega 3rich fish oil demand and processing capacity are growing so fast that the asian carp industry may be working toward its own demise a statebacked study , to be published at year s end , should reveal whether the increased harvest is reducing carp numbers we want to crash the population , said kevin irons , aquaculture and aquatic nuisance manager for the illinois department of natural resources we 're not trying to find a sustainable yield
the pigskin pugilists were barely off the field before the real question about and jim schwartz was asked what will the nfl do with two of its brightest young coaches who behaved as if they were even younger perhaps still on the junior high school playground \? the nfl does not usually discipline players who push and shove on the field unless punches are thrown on monday evening , it applied the same litmus test to coaches no fighting , no foul , no fines , the league announced however , both coaches told ray anderson today that their postgame conduct was wrong and will not happen again , the league spokesman greg aiello said of conversations both coaches had with the nfl s top executive for football operations we believe their response is the correct one and that their postgame conduct going forward will be more appropriate player scrums are chalked up to the intensity and physicality of the game , and everybody understands when frustration and hubris collide and coalesce but the nfl had to weigh whether coaches are supposed to be the adults in the room , held to a higher standard of behavior harbaugh s graceless exuberance when he met up with schwartz on sunday and schwartz s extended pique in chasing him would seem to undermine the notion that coaches are any more immune to the forces of competition than their players except for the quick action of a public relations official and a few players , the handshake a sportsmanshipsupporting contrivance in the first place could have easily ignited a brawl but it did n't harbaugh , coach of the , and schwartz , coach of the , bumped shoulders and maybe chests , and they appeared to exchange a few unprintable words but that kind of thing happens on the subway and in pickup basketball games every day it s hard to demand a higher baseline of etiquette than that in a game where players try to poke each other s eyes during pileups embarrassing , but i think this is much ado about nothing , the former coach brian billick said monday the long , colorful history of the nfl provided little precedent for how to handle a situation that made bill belichick s passiveaggressive greetings with eric mangini look like a day at a cotillion , but it also makes clear that harbaugh and schwartz are not anywhere near alone in not behaving like gentlemen chuck noll once wagged a finger in jerry glanville s face during a postgame handshake because he thought glanville coached his team to play dirty buddy ryan punched kevin gilbride on the sideline when both were assistants with the houston oilers in 1994 because ryan was frustrated with gilbride s runandshoot offense george allen , who used to wave to opposing coaches rather than shake their hands , challenged tom landry to a fight at midfield none of them were disciplined by the league in fact , allen , the former washington redskins coach , had taken tae kwon do classes and told his team he would challenge landry to a fight at midfield , winner take all he broke boards in the locker room , and that got the team riled up , too they were n't similar , put it that way , said bruce allen , george s son , who is now the redskins' general manager and said he did not think schwartz or harbaugh should be disciplined it s a very competitive world i would n't call it a fraternity i would call it a mutualrespect society they have great respect for each other and the profession , but the goal is to make the other team miserable teams take on the personality of their coaches on game day you do n't think coach halas and coach lombardi had words \? they did allen said he believed that , outside of the 49ers and the lions , nobody else in the nfl would think anything else of sunday s contretemps in remarks to reporters monday , schwartz called the situation regrettable he also did not deny that when harbaugh threw a challenge flag on a touchdown play which drew an unsportsmanlikeconduct penalty for harbaugh because the play could not be challenged schwartz yelled , know the rules in the direction of the 49ers sideline it s unfortunate , schwartz said of the donnybrook the game is played by the players on the field we certainly do n't want things like that to occur there are competitive people in the league , and i think we need to do a better job of just leaving it to the players on the field there is another issue to consider the raw emotion on display sunday plays a role in the success schwartz and harbaugh have had in rebuilding their teams the early reports on how harbaugh has turned around the 49ers hit repeatedly on the same theme he is all football , all the time it does not excuse his puppyletofftheleash act and the bitterness of the lions' first loss does not excuse schwartz s petulance either but it does explain how even grown men get carried away with their bravado and bluster maybe someday the brimming passion of harbaugh and schwartz will backfire josh mcdaniels showed this kind of excitement early in his denver broncos tenure , and look how that turned out for now , though , the league office deemed their behavior acceptable controlling the coaches , though , is another matter and one for which players might have the best insight i do n't know if i want to , 49ers quarterback alex smith said the nfl trading deadline , no relation to the much more active baseball trading deadline , is tuesday just as in baseball , though , the buyers and sellers say plenty about how a team s management perceives its chances this season the broncos put receiver brandon lloyd on the market , and the recently benched quarterback kyle orton might be available , too , in the nfl equivalent of a fire sale that means the broncos are looking ahead to 2012 and beyond , trying to get some value for players they know will do nothing for them then lloyd was traded to st louis on monday , reuniting him with josh mcdaniels , now the rams' offensive coordinator , under whom he had his greatest success that was an acknowledgment by the rams that even a quarterback of sam bradford s caliber will struggle without viable receiving threats the indianapolis colts have receiver reggie wayne and defensive lineman robert mathis in the final years of their contracts with peyton manning out and the season spiraling down the drain , might the colts send them off to pick up some draft picks \? the owner , jim irsay , said no on his twitter feed last weekend \( he did add i'm negotiating 2 buy mars though so i can ensure intergalactic , nfl dominance for 25th century \) meaning the colts will not give up on this season and have no plans for a fullscale rebuilding any time soon the philadelphia eagles might prefer to skip the bye week after finally getting their act together against the redskins on sunday the good news for the eagles , aside from the fact that the defense finally looked competent and michael vick played well , is that when they return from the bye , they have three straight games at home , starting with the dallas cowboys that is the payoff for starting with four of six games on the road the win qualified as a season saver , and not just because of the twoweek firestorm the eagles would have endured by losing but at 24 , and with four games left against division opponents \( two with the cowboys \) , the eagles are only two games behind the divisionleading giants
as the chatter continues over united states coach bob bradley s decision to play a largely inexperienced and experimental team on saturday in a 40 loss to spain , the no 1 team in the world , the man whom bradley answers to will have none of it look , all our national team games are on national tv , there were a good number of people in the stands and we played the best team in the world , the united states soccer federation president sunil gulati said sunday at red bull arena in harrison , nj , where the united states women played mexico i m disappointed at the outcome , of course but you know , a week ago , i was in london to watch barcelona pretty easily beat manchester united , the secondbest team in the world right now , spanish soccer is at a level no one can match and i m not going to get into the lineup issue the good news is that more people seem to care about how bradley constructs and coaches his team the bad news is that more people seem to care about how bradley constructs and coaches his team before and since the spain game , the blogosphere seethed with doubters who offered that if the united states does not win the concacaf gold cup , gulati should consider making a change coaches can win every game , and there are still questions , gulati said bob is our national team coach bradley will presumably employ his a team when the americans open play in the gold cup on tuesday against canada in detroit and if mexico s 50 dismantling of el salvador and costa rica s 50 rout of cuba are any indication of what the united states could face down the road , bradley s team has its work cut out soccer diplomacy some parts of the united states government have begun to figure out that speaking to the rest of the world in the language of soccer makes sense in washington on monday , secretary of state hillary clinton announced the women s world cup initiative empowering women and girls through sports working with us soccer , the program hopes to empower and women and girls worldwide using the power of sports and international exchange a group of 18 teenage girls and their coaches from bolivia , germany , malaysia , pakistan , south africa and areas with palestinian populations will spend 10 days in the new york and washington to play and train with local teams and meet members of the united states women s national team the american team will leave for europe next week to begin final preparations for the women s world cup in germany

it has been one of newsweek s signature ventures and a staple of american political journalism since 1984 every presidential election season , the magazine detached a small group of reporters from their daily jobs for a year to travel with the presidential candidates and document their every internal triumph and despair all under the condition that none of it was to be printed until after the election then two days after election day , the sum of their reporters' work would appear in the magazine but the ambitious undertaking , known inside the magazine simply as the project , is no more newsweek , bleeding red ink and searching for a fresh identity under new ownership , has decided the project would not go forward this election season explaining the decision to end the series , edward felsenthal , executive editor of newsweek and the daily beast , its online partner , cited the quickening speed of the news cycle in a news environment when scoops are often measured in milliseconds between twitter posts , fewer news organizations are comfortable waiting to publish the kinds of attentiongrabbing anecdotes that they would have once saved for longer articles sitting on election news felt to us out of place in an era where so much information comes out so fast , he said the pace seems measurably faster than even four years ago when many of the most titillating anecdotes about the 2008 campaign were reported in game change by john heilemann and mark halperin , a book that did not hit store shelves until january 2010 politico and random house have teamed up to produce serialized campaign ebooks that will be released in four installments as the presidential race unfolds the first is due out nov 30 and already has a title playbook 2012 the right fights back it is being cowritten by evan thomas , a former newsweek writer who worked on the election project , and edited by jon meacham , the former newsweek editor newsweek s move also shows how newsrooms are being forced to reprioritize sometimes in ways that seem anathema to their culture as their budgets get ever smaller for all news organizations , the cost of covering a presidential campaign has risen in recent years , with fewer journalists on the bus to share the cost the cost of campaign travel has soared , said peter goldman , a former newsweek editor and writer who conceived the idea for the project and remained involved in it until 2008 given newsweek s current financial troubles it was sold to sidney harman , the audio tycoon , last year for 1 and debt assumption and is on track to lose tens of millions of dollars again this year despite efforts at a turnaround he said the decision was understandable it was expensive to do , and they 're looking at a lot of red ink in the last few election years , the costs for newsweek s project were approaching 1 million , people involved with it said the unusual structure essentially meant newsweek had two political reporting teams working entirely separate from each other a churchstate divide in which the reporters shared a photographer but not their notes the reporters writing for the weekly magazine would get much of their work done during the day while project writers would typically get their best material in the evening , often over long , expensive dinners out over the years , the project produced some memorable nuggets , like the quip john kerry reportedly uttered to an aide after learning george w bush had topped him in yet another poll i ca n't believe i'm losing to this idiot there was also the indelible image of sarah palin , dripping wet and wearing nothing but a towel , breezing through her hotel room in minneapolis while aides for senator john mccain waited to speak with her i 'll be just a minute , she told them it was an invention i was proud of while it lasted , mr goldman said i'm sorry to hear it s dying but stuff happens in this new age this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo newsweek s election issue in 2008 , containing the yearlong story of the obama campaign
how important is the fact that justin bieber , teen fetish object , tweeted from his hospital bed after an allergy attack last week \? that really depends on who you ask for many of us , mr bieber s medical or twitter status is of only minor interest , but there are millions of people who crave any whiff of bieberian intelligence and popdustcom , a new pop music site , is so there for them created by craig marks , until recently the editor of the music trade publication billboard , and before that , blender magazine , popdust is an effort to sprinkle some pixie dust via news and interviews with big deal at least this week pop stars the site received an initial round of 1 million or so in financing from backers that included the father and son team of kenneth \( the huffington post \) and ben \( thrillist \) lerer there are plenty of musicdriven sites , big ones like aol music and smaller , but very influential ones like pitchfork , a maypole of indie rock , but probably none that would do a deep deconstruction of britney spears s appearance at the grammys in 2000 by way of putting her upcoming comeback shot there in perspective sites like pitchfork are great , but they are writing about 5 percent of the music consumed , said mr marks , who also worked at spin magazine back in the 1990 s it s a big country and the thing about pop music , the music you hear on top 40 radio , is that the audience is underserved pop music gets very little attention from critics , but it is some of the most interesting music around right now you hear a lot about lady gaga and justin bieber , but you never hear much about the music they are making \( disclosure moment mr craig worked at insidecom , the media news site back in 2001 , where decoder also worked \) mr marks said that stephen colvin of the daily beast newsweek came to him with interest from a backer in starting a music site the pair knew each other from back when mr colvin ran dennis publishing although the initial idea fizzled out , they continued talking and soon enough , a concept and some other players emerged , including cochairmen kevin fortuna \( the former chief executive of quigo \) and philip james \( chief executive of snoothcom \) david wade , the former vice president of sales at imeem , a music site that was acquired and then closed down by myspace , is the president of popdust other financial backers include softbank , rre , the raptor group and michael jackson , a senior adviser at iac , who brought the idea to mr lerer we think it is a great time to invest in content and think that popdust could get very big , very fast , said kenneth lerer social media will be a big part of it something like 2 percent of all worldwide tweets are about justin bieber so there s a very good possibility that some of its content will be highly viral for now , the site is tiny , with two fulltime writers and a photo editor , but mr marks is hoping his long crush on pop music and equally long history covering the music business will help the site land interviews and exclusives with the kind of pop stars who put the bubble in bubblegum music for the time being , much of the content on the site is aggregated video with a heap of annotation , but mr marks is confident the site will be making its own videos soon enough the site is in beta , but is expected to go wide before this year s grammys on feb 13 music is generally covered in two ways on the web bands either play live or they show up in dreadfully dull interviews both of those things are pretty played out , mr marks said hopefully , the magazine experience i have taught me a few tricks about packaging stuff about this kind of music that will give people another look at the people who make it'
films of the twoact romantic ballet giselle go back almost 80 years the clips of blackandwhite silent film of \( 1932 \) and \( 1937 \) used to be rare as gold dust now you can see them on youtube the ancient film technology , however , makes anyone watching today frustrated by its obvious inadequacies so it s dismaying that the new giselle in 3d , featuring one of the finest casts achievable today , makes even more basic cinematic errors the performance , recorded at the mariinsky theater in st petersburg , features natalia osipova , from the bolshoi ballet in moscow , as giselle amid an otherwise allmariinsky cast the filming is by the british company can communicate , a title that turns out to be somewhat optimistic in the bright stage daylight of act i of giselle the immediate impression of 3d is that it isolates characters from the area behind them so much that they look like cutouts , artificially superimposed then , in a basic tracking shot , the reverse happens it s the background scenery that looks artificially imposed \( like the unconvincing views over the shoulders of people driving cars in old movies \) but once giselle and her suitor start to dance , there s a much more pronounced problem especially in jumps of blurring though this has been an occasional issue in films of ballet over the decades , never before in my experience has it been so pronounced as in act i here and yet the worst feature of this giselle , as shown in some cinemas , including , the imax on west 42nd street in manhattan , where i saw it , is something much more basic as the dances proceed , the frame repeatedly crops the dancers' feet at first this happens while often leaving plenty of space above the performers' heads in act ii , however , the camera closes in so that if a dancer raises an arm , we do n't see anything from elbow to hand and when the jumping gets going it abounds in act ii of giselle we 're given several jumps in which first we ca n't see the feet taking off , and then we ca n't see the full head as it soars out of frame what s a jump in a ballet when you ca n't see its basis or its apex \? there are , admittedly , reports of other screenings where this problem did not occur in act i none of this stopped the main impact of ms osipova , here making a guest appearance with the mariinsky for three years now she has been one of the world s three leading exponents of the role but the recent memory of seeing the other two the mariinsky s own and the s dance the role this spring with does not stop the intensity of interpretation from registering with exceptional keenness she s the ideal dancer for everything you want 3d to be ultradistinct ms osipova is a dance actress of lifeenhancing vitality as she mimes the traditional gesture for dance arms above the head , hands circling it s a joy just to watch how her whole spine subtly sways she seizes on fleeting details and makes them newly ardent , as when , after accompanying the duke of courland and his daughter , bathilde , into her cottage , she then emerges and eagerly shows her new necklace \( bathilde s gift \) to her friends when this giselle goes mad , we 're distressed but not shocked she has been living on the edge ms osipova has no ballerina artifice , and when she falls dead , it s with her legs slightly apart and without trying to show us the arch of her pointed feet as her doubletiming aristocratic lover , albrecht , appears even younger than she is too cherubic indeed to make the story quite credible he s a less original actor than ms osipova when he enters in act ii , you 're aware with what careful elaboration he has draped his cloak \( this slow , dolorous entrance has now become one of the worst clich s of this ballet \) but his dancing , most of which occurs in act ii , has great freshness and lan it s too bad that it suffers so much from the camerawork the performance of act ii should seem twice as phenomenal as this film allows it to be there are clips of ms osipova s interpretation on youtube that carry more excitement than this one blame the camera it s the same problem with yekaterina kondaurova , who is , with gillian murphy , one of the world s two most distinguished dancers of the role of myrta , the queen of the spectral wilis in act ii in myrta s first entrance across the stage , however , the only parts of the body that moves are her feet which in this film are out of view and another thing when giselle rises from the grave , why does n't she have wings \? as in the 1982 dvd of this production starring galina mezentseva , both myrta and giselle are seen to fly through the air in act ii no company dances giselle with more elegant refinement than the mariinsky \( sometimes too much so in the peasant dances \) the company s production , decades old , is in good shape the act i peasant pas de deux is cut from this performance balletomanes may miss its virtuosity , but it has always interrupted an otherwise suspenseful drama it s easy to imagine that can communicate has a better film of this distinguished performance in its lockers than the one it edited for release
boston many hockey fans would be pleased if their team had taken a twogamestonone lead in a playoff series , especially if those victories came on the road but not fans , judging from the radio callin shows tuesday morning , only hours after the bruins had won game 2 of their secondround series , 32 , in overtime there was a distinct undercurrent of trepidation with game 3 to be played here wednesday , and it is easy to understand recent history , it seems , weighs heavily on the bruins last spring , they took a threegame lead over the but lost the series , a collapse that included blowing a 30 lead in game 7 at home only three teams have ever lost a series after winning the first three games it s only natural for people to be pessimistic a little bit , said mark recchi , the 43yearold bruins forward who has seen a lot in 15 postseasons since 1991 we know what s at stake here we believe in each other we 're not worried about what people say even flyers coach senses the burden of history bearing down on the bruins it relieves us of the pressure , i believe , a little bit to just go in and play a game in boston , he said after monday s loss and while it relieves us of the pressure , it certainly mounts onto them to be successful now that they have a 20 lead surely laviolette s claim seems incredible , since it sounds almost as if he preferred that the flyers had lost the first two games so what could boston fans possibly be uneasy about after scored 14 minutes into the extra period , boosting the bruins' overtime record this spring to 40 , and capping a trip to philadelphia that started with a 73 victory saturday \? for one thing , they are worried that it took tremendous goaltending by the vezina trophy favorite to hold off the flyers on monday he stopped 52 of 54 shots , including the last 46 in a row the bruins , who took 41 shots , were outshot by 3212 over the last 34 minutes it s almost unfair that we have timmy back there for us , forward brad marchand said they could have dominated that game , and they did for the most part , but he just made some unbelievable saves there is also trepidation in boston over the ineffectiveness of the bruins' power play , which is 0 for 29 in the postseason when the bruins beat montreal in overtime in game 7 in the opening round , they became the first team to win a bestofseven series without scoring a powerplay goal it was the 560th bestofseven series in nhl history oh yes , we 've talked about that quite a bit , bruins coach claude julien said tuesday , clearly tired of having to address questions about his team s futility with a manpower advantage when pressed , he was hardly more forthcoming we had some chances , but we did n't bury them , he said of the bruins' two power plays and five powerplay shots monday although we did n't score , i thought our power play was better and if it keeps getting better , we 'll get results real soon mike milbury , a former bruins defenseman and coach and now a television commentator , did not seem so optimistic in a radio interview he suggested blowing up the power play and parking boston s 6foot9 defenseman , zdeno chara , in front of the flyers' net to create screens julien insisted that if the bruins stayed focused on the game at hand , they would be ok if we play well , we 'll be up another game , he said , without mentioning the 2010 debacle but the flyers , at their practice rink in voorhees , nj , were certainly mentioning it , transcripts provided by the team showed you can say they 're the same , i guess , claude giroux said , comparing this series with last year s we 're in the same position mike richards , the flyers' captain , said boston obviously has had us in this situation before for us , it s something that i think we ca n't get discouraged by laviolette acknowledged that the flyers might be pressing their luck to think they can rally from a 20 deficit a year after coming all the way back against the same team still , he said , we 're going to go into boston and have some fun we just put our comfortable slippers on he added that s technically 05 i'm not sure that any team in the history of sports has ever come back from 05 back in boston , recchi said the bruins were blocking out the chatter about the prospect of failure with success so close there s no pressure , he said we get in our bubble and worry only about what we have to do we 're not worried about the past
all through the baseball playoffs , mike tanier will provide the bats blog with daily updates on lessthanimportant developments from around the league his phillies homerism is no longer an issue bobby thomson bill mazeroski kirk gibson nelson cruz you never know who will hit a historic home run , or when one will be hit , though the bottom of the 11th inning of a playoff game is a great time to look for them cruz s gamewinning grand slam might not be remembered with some of the greatest hits of yesteryear the tigers could come back from two down to take the pennant but it is the first walkoff grand slam in major league playoff history , so at the very least it will live forever in trivia question form as monday night drama goes , we ll take an 11th inning grand slam over whatever is happening on house , or the bears and lions striving to commit 25 penalties before halftime on monday night football because cruz s home run may still be talked about 50 years from now , the new york times would like to immortalize the act in the kind of resounding baseball prose that echoes across generations and stirs the imaginations of fans not yet born but since none of our really good writers are available to update the blog , they are letting me take a whack at it setting the scene ryan perry is on the mound for the tigers michael young is on third base he singled past the diving reach of third baseman don kelly , who was playing down the line to protect the corners adrian beltre is on second he singled to center mike napoli is on first his single fell between right fielder andy dirks and center fielder austin jackson , skipping off dirks glove and bouncing off jackson s hip fox television has displayed a last walkoff hit graphic under each batter , establishing a kind of permajinx that suggests that they want the game to last forever anything to not have to broadcast another episode of house the at bat nelson cruz steps to the plate , his left leg cocked back to the edge of the batter s box , his stance upright he takes a vicious rip at an offspeed pitch , fouling it straight back while pinwheeling in the box and taking several hops toward the first base line no one told cruz that a bloop single wins the game no one told him that a sacrifice fly wins the game , or that a slow roller that just gets past the mound wins the game or perhaps someone told him and he did not listen , because cruz clearly believes that the only way to win the game is to hit the ball 650 feet to left field perry s second pitch is a belthigh fastball cruz rips it foul down the third base line fox shows a cruz highlight montage from the game in the seventh inning , he homered off the left field foul pole to tie the game in the ninth , he was hit in the wrist and chest by a jose valverde pitch cruz is shown grimacing and crumpling to the ground from three gratuitous angles , as if the play were a car explosion in a jeanclaude van damme movie tigers catcher alex avila calls timeout crowd reaction shots are the heart and soul of televised baseball the camera cuts to a woman looking down at her rangers 2010 american league champions teeshirt the shirt shows michael young and other stars in yellowish sepiatoned images , as if they are taken from old newspaper clippings it is probably a heck of a shirt closeup , but from a distance it looks like the poor woman spilled just spilled a beer perry wastes a breaking ball in the dirt it is not a waste , really the way cruz has been corkscrewing on pitches , that could have been strike three if it broke a little later but cruz lays off it a reaction shot of ron washington reminds us that either the revolution in men s eyewear fashion has passed the rangers manager by , or he is far , far ahead of it perry throws a 12 slider it hangs , reaching the plate near the inside corner and just above cruz s knees it is a ball perry would like to have back , and he may get it if it ever lands cruz turns on it framebyframe analysis of the replay shows cruz admiring his work from the moment it leaves his bat , avila dropping to one knee and following the ball s path with resigned ah , well body language , and infielders watching the arc of the ball with a clear understanding that there is no need to go cover any bases the celebration napoli throws his batting helmet high into the air as he rounds third somewhere , brandon jacobs mutters to himself cruz bowls his batting helmet into a throng of teammates , hoping for a 710 split close examination of the replay shows several teammates egging cruz on to bowl the helmet , possibly because they do not want to be hit with it when it lands ian kinsler grabs elvis andrus from behind and lifts him so he is directly in the path of the rolling helmet this must be a clubhouse hobby for the rangers bowling for andrus mark lowe douses cruz with a cup of water , splashing the television camera in the process to create a few magical moments of players celebrating through a haze of water droplets it takes a special kind of person to decide that the proper way to congratulate a teammate upon doing something incredibly important is to throw a cup of water at him there is a second splash of water visible on the replays , but after 20 minutes of framebyframe analysis , i could not find its origin this second splasher theory will haunt me for weeks perhaps napoli s helmet landed in a nearby jug of gatorade and this is how you avoid a onerun win , jack buck says over the replay were the rangers trying to avoid a onerun win \? avoiding wins of any kind is a rather strange concept in sports buck may have been thrown off his game by the fact that terry francona had his arm around him during the extrainning broadcast booth cutaways rangers general manager jon daniels hugs his wife nolan ryan highfives a fan and makes a happy face no one quite makes a happy face like ryan , who came across as a little dour when he was a pitcher his eyes light up , his chin drops to below his shoulders , and his top lip curls up so all of his teeth are visible he looks like a giddy jackolantern carved by a kindergarten teacher who does not want anything scary in the classroom finally , a brief interview with cruz , now wearing shaving cream all over his face and smiling so wide that his braces are visible the following update is posted on the facebook page of drs alexander orthodontics in arlington minutes after the grand slam congratulations nelson cruz and the texas rangers ! ! love the alexander smile as nellie smashed the grand slam walk off home run ! ! patient confidentiality just isn t what it used to be
the melancholy over steve jobs s passing is not just about the loss of the inventor of so many products we enjoy it is also about the loss of someone who personified so many of the leadership traits we know are missing from our national politics those traits jump out of every jobs obituary he was someone who did not read the polls but changed the polls by giving people what he was certain they wanted and needed before they knew it he was someone who was ready to pursue his vision in the face of long odds over multiple years and , most of all , he was someone who earned the respect of his colleagues , not by going easy on them but by constantly pushing them out of their comfort zones and , in the process , inspiring ordinary people to do extraordinary things there is n't a single national politician today whom you would describe by those attributes , which is why the fake jobs obituary published in the onion , the satirical newspaper , struck such a nerve it began by saying steve jobs , the visionary cofounder of apple computers and the only american in the country who had any clue what he was doing died wednesday at the age of 56 it went on to quote president obama as saying that jobs will be remembered both for the lifechanging products he created and for the fact that he was able to sit down , think clearly , and execute his ideas attributes he shared with no other us citizen this is a dark time for our country , because the reality is none of the 300 million or so americans who remain can actually get anything done or make things happen' ouch ! fortunately , the last part is not true there are still thousands of us innovators who embody steve jobs s most important attribute they did n't get the word they did n't get the word that we 're down and out they did n't get the word that we 're in a recession they did n't get the word that germany is going to eat our breakfast and that china is going to eat our lunch , so they just go out and invent stuff and make stuff and export stuff like jobs , they just did n't get the word and thank god but we 're not doing them justice because our political system is not providing these entrepreneurs what they need to thrive in the 21st century think of how cramped and uninspiring our national debate has become it is all about cutting , filibustering , vetoing and blaming or solving our problems by either untaxing or taxing millionaires alone neither party is saying here is the world we are living in here are the big trends here is our longterm plan for rolling up our sleeves to ensure that america thrives in this world because it is not going to come easy nothing important ever does what is john boehner s vision \? i laugh just thinking about the question what is president obama s vision \? i cry just thinking about the question the republican party has been taken over by an antitax cult , and obama just seems lost obama supporters complain that the gop has tried to block him at every turn that is true but it s because obama never persuaded people that he had a grand bargain tied to a vision worth fighting for we cannot bail or taxcut our way to prosperity we can only , as jobs understood , invent our way there that is why america needs to be for the world in the 21st century what cape canaveral was to america in the 1960s the place where everyone everywhere should want to come to start up and make something something that makes people s lives more productive , healthy , comfortable , entertained , educated or secure to do that , we need to reinvigorate our traditional formula for success quality education and infrastructure , open immigration , the right rules to incentivize risktaking and governmentfinanced scientific research but to do all that in a recession means we have to cut spending , raise tax revenues and invest in this formula and to do that , we need a grand bargain that involves upfront spending plus credible , longterm fiscal reform that is at the true scale of our debt problem obama has given the spending plan , but he has not produced a credible , thisreallyhurts fiscal plan and many americans know it the paucity of obama s audacity is striking sometimes the news is in the noise , like the wall street protests or the tea party but sometimes the news is also in the silence to me , the biggest protest in the country today is that when the tea party insanely blocked any gop participation in a grand bargain that involved taxes , most americans were silent why \? because they did n't think obama was offering a big plan from his side , either one that rose to the true scale of our problems and aspirations , one that would push us out of our comfort zone and make us great the country has been way ahead of the politicians , argues stan greenberg , a democratic pollster they are impatient with the small and the short term voters totally understand the scale of the problem facing the country , and they are looking for leaders who are ready to step up and offer a big vision and do n't try to fool them with things that do n't address the longterm challenges

since 2009 , unemployment among recent college graduates has risen , while starting salaries have fallen the median student debt load for those who graduated from 2006 to 2010 is 20 , 000 not surprisingly , 40 percent of 20somethings move back in with their parents at least once here are some dispatches from the home front dylan suher my tragic starring role ana chireno elevated by the train eve ahearn d j vu in my parents kitchen raphael popesussman spoiled , and sick of it peter weinberg life in the pleasure palace my tragic starring role park slope , brooklyn the first thing i see when i wake up in the morning is my name in lights specifically , i see a giant sign that hangs over my bed smothered in glitter and festooned with stars and christmas lights , it spells out my name in cardboard letters it was commissioned for my bar mitzvah , and was later used to decorate my childhood bedroom the bedroom in which i now sleep i would have moved it , but i was planning on staying here only temporarily then temporarily became indefinitely , indefinitely became for the foreseeable future , and finally , i began marking the time spent in my parents home retrospectively three months , six months , a year if i move that sign now , it means i m committing to permanent residence , an idea that is far too depressing to seriously contemplate in any case , there s nowhere to put it my little league trophies are still on my bookshelves my drawers are filled with clothes i long ago outgrew , while the clothes i wear today are piled in stacks on the floor the posters and paintings that decorated my college apartment items that express the person i am at 23 instead of the child i was at 7 remain in boxes hidden in the corners of my room i don t spend a lot of time pitying myself moving back home was the rational choice to make , under the circumstances i had little work experience and few marketable skills when i graduated , and i knew i would have to take a series of unpaid internships before i could find the publishing job i ve always wanted but the fact that a choice is responsible doesn t make it pleasant my parents provide me with homecooked meals and don t charge me rent but i d kill to put five miles between myself and their unsolicited job and dating advice worst of all is their inability to understand why i m unhappy to be living at home as far as they re concerned , it s paradise i ve got everything i need i get a lot of that from people their age everyone keeps saying things like you ll be fine , it ll all work out and you just need to pound the pavement i don t think they know or remember what it s like to send off r sum after r sum , to finally get a job and still not make it out of your parents house i don t think they ve tried to imagine waking up every morning in stars and spaceship sheets \( the only set that fits my childsize bed \) the feeling of failure the feeling that the natural order of life that you become an adult and then you leave home has been disrupted at least my peers understand a lot of them are in the same situation , and the rest face bigger challenges bouncing from sublet to sublet , working sevenday weeks just to pay the rent we were encouraged to dream of having our names in lights admittedly , that dream was a little grandiose but , at least for now , in an economy that offers precious little opportunity , those aspirations seem like just another childhood relic good for hanging on the wall , and not much more dylan suher graduated from washington university in st louis in 2010 elevated by the train brownsville , brooklyn despite having roots grounded deep in brooklyn and even deeper in the dominican republic , i have always felt disconnected from my home as a child , i was constantly being shuttled to some better place my parents sent me to catholic school in bushwick , then high school in manhattan , to keep me away from the local kids and their precocious knowledge of malas palabras bad words we went to distant neighborhoods to buy vegetables because the ones they sold in our bodegas were hardly edible the adults commuted across the city for work the message was clear the good stuff was outside of our neck of the concrete jungle the direction to go was outward , away from brownsville in high school , each day began at 7 48 am on the dark , empty , urinestained , elevated platform for the no 3 train the only high rises on the horizon were public housing towers , all red brick and small windows it took only 30 minutes to pull into the mosaictiled , less urinestained station in lower manhattan , below the banks and skyscrapers , with all the commuters in nice suits and majestically colorful socks in the evenings the trip was reversed i rode the train past scrap metal yards , lonely lots and railroad tracks the return seeming almost clandestine those rides back into brownsville weren t supposed to last into my 20s i went to college , and i wasn t really supposed to come back but here i am it was fine at first most of my friends had moved home too but , like each stop on a lightup subway map , they disappeared one by one , moving away from their ethnic enclaves to join the rank and file of people who had made it i stayed behind , philosophizing about what to do with a philosophy degree while unemployed and still in brownsville i don t mean to suggest that my degree hasn t served me well it didn t get me a job , but it changed the way i saw the world from plato s rhetorical myth of the metals , in which goldsouled men become rulers and bronzesouled men laborers , to web dubois s color line , philosophy inspired me to question my assumptions where i once saw only poverty , i learned to see systemic inequality and the possibility of change now , instead of always looking out toward somewhere else , i m beginning to look around here , wondering how i can make this neighborhood the better place my parents always sought for me i m still hoping , planning , to move out but i know now i ll stay close to the elevated train , somehow ana chireno graduated from stony brook university in 2009 d j vu in my parents kitchen tribeca , manhattan exactly a week after i graduated from college , i found myself sitting at my parents kitchen table practicing sat math problems , in the same seat where i studied for the sats the first time , five years ago i m not trying a second run at school though now that i mention it , it doesn t seem like a bad idea i ve spent the last few weeks sleeping in what usually serves as a storage room in my parents home , before i leave for a job as an sat tutor in central america although i am living here , the term my parents house is one i carefully use , a verbal distinction that keeps me distanced it s mine no longer my mom turned my bedroom into a painting studio at the start of my sophomore year i didn t fight to keep it i actually pushed for the change maybe i thought it would keep me from moving home , which i saw as a sign of total failure obviously it didn t quite work my parents are former hippies who never bothered to enumerate house rules i ve always tried to stay out of trouble so they never have to if i stay out late , i close the front door quietly on my return i ll drink the white wine my parents leave in the refrigerator , but never finish the bottle i ll never ask for money , but eagerly take any that s offered \( not that that s actually happened yet , but i m still hopeful \) they haven t told me anything i m not allowed to do , and i am looking to keep it that way there s much to enjoy about living at home here i have a refrigerator with food in it and a physical copy of the newspaper to read at breakfast i get to spend unplanned time with my family and there s none of the pressure of a short visit my parents seem to like it as well for my mom , my stay is an extended visit from technical support whenever i came home for breaks , she would lament that i never stayed long enough to figure out what was wrong with the remote controls while i m not living with my parents indefinitely i no longer see moving home as a failure i spent a semester studying in mexico during my sophomore year , and it surprised me how confounded people were when i said i went to school in new hampshire even though my family lived in new york why would you ever go to school so far from home \? my friends would ask aren t there colleges in new york city \? these kids were absolutely modern , but still they assumed that they would live with their parents until marriage when family or finances make living at home after college the most appropriate choice , there is no need to mythologize moving out in other words , i learned during college how to move home \( even if i didn t learn any more sat algebra \) but i ll still be happy to give up my seat at my parents kitchen table eve ahearn graduated from dartmouth in june since writing this , she has moved out and begun her job spoiled , and sick of it park slope , brooklyn my day inevitably begins with a serious moral quandary involving corn flakes i eat corn flakes for breakfast each morning when i am finished , i rinse off my spoon and bowl , place them in the sink and attempt to leave the kitchen but each day , without fail , i freeze at the room s threshold , paralyzed by guilt what kind of jerk leaves a dirty dish in his mother s sink \? at school , i always cleaned up after myself , but now that i m home from college , i frequently find myself leaving a mess and then agonizing about it suddenly , i m a kid again i don t shop for myself , i don t make my bed , i don t do the laundry the fridge is always stocked with cold cuts , lox and orange juice , available free of charge but the food comes at a cost my mother nags me my flip flops will ravage the arches of my feet and i ll regret that i ignored her pleas to buy sandals , but only if the radiation from my cellphone doesn t kill me first and i respond , in perfectly passiveaggressive fashion , by forgoing all responsibility the more she does for me , the less i am willing or able to do for myself i m being spoiled rotten this isn t the first time i ve been spoiled at home i spent a semester here last spring , while undergoing treatment for testicular cancer those were miserable , enervating months all of which i spent stuck inside my mother s house it was a warm and wellappointed place to be trapped but i was still trapped now i m home again still a few credits short of graduating in a house that is a constant reminder of being sick i sit on the same couch , watch the same tv , sleep in the same bed this is the house with toilets i spent hours kneeling in front of and stairs i sometimes could barely climb the most unpleasant memory is of utter helplessness , of having my every need attended to because i was incapable of doing anything for myself at 22 , being taken care of is a crippling thing you ve spent four years at college learning how to live on your own , and suddenly that disappears now , when i m lounging around aimlessly on a saturday afternoon , i feel a twinge of that same helplessness a lot of my friends are also back home now and i see them struggling to figure out what they re doing with their lives they have jobs or internships and aspirations , but they re troubled by their loss of independence that is a substantial loss , one that turns something as simple as washing a dish into an existential event and makes motherly advice feel like character assassination it brings all the latent neuroses and insecurities to the surface in the words of groucho marx , home is where you hang your head i like to imagine that living at home is the only thing that stands in the way of my complete maturation in the fall , i tell myself , i will start work and find an apartment and then i ll be a genuine adult i ll wake up early , cook and pay all my own bills but i know that growing up involves more than moving out in a few months , will i really be more mature than i am today \? do i have what it takes to live out in the world \? i m sure i want to move out i m unsure about pretty much everything else raphael popesussman is a student at columbia he writes the blog the audacity of pope , about his experience with cancer life in the pleasure palace upper west side , manhattan i ve always had a plan for life after college driving away , the campus fading from sight , i would put on abbey road and skip to you never give me your money there s a line in that beatles song that would perfectly sync up with the moment out of college , money spent , see no future , pay no rent , all the money s gone , nowhere to go when i finally got the chance to live out this fantasy a few months ago , it wasn t what like i imagined i didn t know how to drive i never had any money to begin with and i did have somewhere to go manhattan john lennon and paul mccartney were right about one thing though i m not paying any rent when i first realized i d be moving back in with my parents , i did what anyone would do i booked a ticket to southeast asia but after a few wonderful weeks of eating an astonishing range of noodles and praying to local deities for a studio apartment in the village , i knew it was time to face my fears i ve been living here for a while now , and you know what \? it s not bad this apartment has it all zabar s chocolate croissants for breakfast and a seemingly unlimited supply of pellegrino the laundry is fresh , the bathtubs are pristine and there s even a treadmill and a tv with hbo my parents must have worked thousands of unpaid internships to pay for all this ! how can i complain \? it s not like the dismal job market has forced me to move back to wasilla , alaska but i can t stay in this pleasure palace forever i want to be a writer to grow a beard someday and move to queens , to sleep on the floor and let the cockroaches crawl into my ears and lay eggs in my brain in order to realize this dream , i keep a rigid schedule from 10 am to noon i work on my sitcom pilot at noon i realize it s not that funny then i begin scouring the internet for actual jobs honestly i m enjoying this whole job search thing , except for the part where no one ever responds there are eight million people in

tripoli , libya american and european militaries intensified their barrage of col muammar elqaddafi s forces by air and sea on sunday , as the mission moved beyond taking away his ability to use libyan airspace , to obliterating his hold on the ground as well , allied officials said rebel forces , battered and routed by loyalist fighters just the day before , began to regroup in the east as allied warplanes destroyed dozens of government armored vehicles near the rebel capital , benghazi , leaving a field of burned wreckage along the coastal road to the city by nightfall , the rebels had pressed almost 40 miles back west toward the strategic crossroads city of ajdabiya , witnesses and rebel forces said and they seemed to consolidate control of benghazi despite heavy fighting there against loyalist forces on saturday there was evidence , too , that the allies were striking more targets in and around tripoli , the capital more explosions could be seen or heard near the city center , where an international press corps was kept under tight security constraints recurring bursts of antiaircraft guns and a prolonged shower of tracers arced over the capital on sunday night a day after a summit meeting in paris set the military operation in motion , a vital arab participant in the agreement expressed unhappiness with the way the strikes were unfolding the former chairman of the arab league , amr moussa , told egyptian state media that he was calling for an emergency league meeting to discuss the situation in the arab world , and particularly libya  what is happening in libya differs from the aim of imposing a nofly zone , and what we want is the protection of civilians and not the bombardment of more civilians , he said , referring to libyan government claims that allied bombardment had killed dozens of civilians but reporters seeking proof have been offered none to account for even part of that number around 10 pm , an explosion thundered from colonel qaddafi s personal compound in tripoli , and a column of smoke rose above it , suggesting that the allied forces had struck either his residence there or the nearby barracks of his personal guards a group of foreign journalists were bused to the compound early on monday morning and shown a building partially destroyed by a bomb but those who attended reported no evidence of casualties asked about the explosion , vice adm william e gortney said in a washington news conference that the united states was not trying to kill the libyan leader at this particular point i can guarantee that he s not on a targeting list , he said , saying that the united states military was working to weaken his military capacity rather than removing him the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , adm mike mullen , also focused on those goals , talking about how allied forces had grounded colonel qaddafi s aircraft and worked to protect civilians both objectives stated by the united nations security council in approving the military mission we hit a lot of targets , focused on his command and control , focused on his air defense , and actually attacked some of his forces on the ground in the vicinity of benghazi , admiral mullen told fox news but the campaign may be balancing multiple goals president obama , secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and british and french leaders have also talked of a broader policy objective that colonel qaddafi must leave power in his comments on sunday , admiral mullen suggested that objective lay outside the bounds of the military campaign , saying on nbc that colonel qaddafi s remaining in power after the united states military accomplished its mission was potentially one outcome defense secretary robert m gates , on a flight to russia , said he was concerned about that possible result though he praised the mission s successful start , he cautioned that a partitioned libya , with rebels holding the east and colonel qaddafi the west , could bring trouble i think all countries probably would like to see libya remain a unified state , mr gates said having states in the region begin to break up because of internal differences is a formula for real instability in the future gen carter f ham , who as the head of the united states africa command is overseeing the operation , said in an email on sunday that the initial strikes have had , generally , the effects we sought fixed air defense sites , particularly the longerrange systems , appear to no longer be operating
chicago the , well known for saul bellow , milton friedman and its links to 85 , was once famous sea to shining sea for football it boasted a legendary coach , a heisman trophy winner and a national championship then , in 1939 , it did something extraordinary it gave up the game to save its soul in many colleges , it is possible for a boy to win 12 letters without learning how to write one , robert maynard hutchins , the university s president , had written acidly of sports in the saturday evening post he particularly disparaged football , deriding as myth the idea that the game produced men of good character or instilled a sense of fair play indeed , for a college to be a success on the field , he said , it must be something of a scoundrel beyond it seventytwo years later , what hutchins called the infernal nuisance of college football is troubling more university administrators than ever ohio state , miami , southern california , north carolina and on and on it is as if were affecting the number of bigname colleges in hot water and yet chicago is quietly back on the field instead of euthanizing the game , hutchins merely put it in a coma in 1969 , football returned as a varsity sport , oddly enough during the vietnam war era when many rebellious students were comparing blocking and tackling to bombing and strafing since then , the game has been thriving on its own measured terms in ncaa division iii , free of the highest level of competition winning is a preference and not an obsession players , though zealously recruited , are not given athletic scholarships championships are won but little noticed chicago presents its own kind of parable going from all to none before settling on a path in between we 're just a teaspoon in a larger sandbox , said since 1994 there are places where football is more like a giant shovel , but i prefer it when everything is kept in perspective the university has 15 , 500 students , but a new version of stagg field , where the team plays , has only one short row of bleachers running the length of a single sideline the old stadium , demolished to make room for a library that holds 45 million volumes , resembled a medieval castle complete with turrets the former stagg field seated 55 , 000 the new one holds 1 , 600 i 'd say 25 percent of the students do n't even know we have a football team , said jake longtin , a defensive lineman who is also a team captain last year , when the squad won the university athletic association championship , the clinching victory merited only 187 words in the hometown chicago suntimes and none in the chicago tribune of course , the maroons of the university of chicago no longer play illinois , wisconsin and minnesota , as they did when they won seven conference titles in what later became the big ten nor do they play michigan , the team they beat to win the national championship in 1905 these days , chicago s main rivals are other large urban universities that exist at the forefront of scholarly research and in the backwaters of football carnegie mellon in pittsburgh , case western in cleveland and washington university in st louis on a recent hot and drizzly saturday night , the maroons won their home opener against beloit college , 4425 school was not yet in session but a crowd of about 1 , 400 was enthusiastically , if moistly , observing no band played , no cheerleaders cheered , no mascot turned somersaults john w boyer , the dean of the college , was not at the game , but in a subsequent interview he praised the football program , not necessarily for the team s play but for its appropriate niche within the university he called it an important student activity , likening football to debating he said proudly , we have a nice and proper team the university of chicago was founded in 1890 john d rockefeller , in his wisdom and with his money , was its great patron , endowing an elite university in the centerpiece city of the american prairie to get things going , 10 major buildings were hastily erected and renowned scholars were promptly assembled prominence in the public eye , of course , was not something so speedily to be achieved , and for that the university s first president , william rainey harper , looked to a solution that would one day be the temptation of lots of upandcoming colleges bigtime football barely a generation old , the new sport , adapted from rugby , was a sensation in the northeast to summon it westward , rainey hired a young yale man , amos alonzo stagg , enticing the coach not only with a sizeable salary but an associate professorship and full tenure the maroons soon became the original monsters of the midway stagg proved a brilliant formulator of x s and o s who likewise knew how to pluck the brawniest and nimblest from local high schools his 1899 team was undefeated , knocking off , among others , notre dame , cornell and brown in many ways , football was rougher in those early days , with rulemakers still trying to distinguish between the violence that would be allowable and the choking , punching and stomping that would not but the building blocks of the modern game were falling decisively into place 10 yards produced a first down and a team had four plays to travel the distance the forward pass , once considered a lunatic experiment , was adopted as a reliable tactic at the same time , the unsavory aspects of the game were taking root the business of college football , like the business of america , was business massive stadiums were built , and winning teams were required to keep them full alumni slipped cash into secret slush funds , and the best football prospects were lured to the university that bid the highest special makeup exams rescued failing athletes from the annoyance of academic probation chicago was considered relatively clean , and however deserved of this virtuous reputation , by the late 1920s its claims of rectitude were supported by a long skein of mediocre seasons the university was simply unwilling to subsidize football players in the manner of its better opponents attendance at games thinned to embarrassing numbers in 1932 , stagg , still a mythic figure , resigned and took his playbook west to the college of the pacific college football , beset by cheating scandals , had many powerful enemies but perhaps no one was a more fetching phrasemaker than hutchins , who in 1929 became the university s fifth president as for me , i am for exercise as long as i do not have to take any myself , he said , among his many witticisms hutchins allowed that ancient athenians and renaissance italians were as crazy about sports as modern americans , but he said they were wise enough not to mix them up with higher education the life of the mind should not be sidetracked by the straining of muscle instead of football , he said , colleges should focus on sports useful later in life , like handball , skating and golf though hutchins s crusade against football had been made more acceptable by chicago s retreat into mediocrity , nothing ran better interference for it than the season the maroons put together in 1939 the team managed to beat wabash and oberlin but it was outscored in its other games , 3060 , including 610 defeats by harvard and ohio state and an 850 loss to its archrival , michigan the alumni were very upset with this string of totally humiliating defeats , though i expect the faculty were especially humiliated by being defeated by harvard , said boyer , an expert historian not only of the habsburg empire but the university itself by then , doing nothing was not an option perhaps so and yet , giving up football was not the only alternative chicago could have played more games against the oberlins and fewer against the michigans but it seems only so much pride could be swallowed competing against its lessers was deemed as disgraceful as a whooping from its betters football has the same relation to education that bullfighting has to agriculture , hutchins said breezily in dismissing the game other uses , ostensibly meritorious , were found for stagg field three years later , scientists standing on the balcony of a squash court under the west stands set off the first selfsustaining nuclear reaction , an event that necessarily preceded the explosion of the world s most powerful bomb in 1956 , chicago hired wally hass as its athletic director a former football coach , he began plotting the sport s revival , first by teaching a football class , then by beginning a football club that played games against featherweight opponents hutchins was gone by then but other antifootball zealots were wary of the club metastasizing into an official team just as some students once cheered the monsters of the midway , others now took pride in attending the university that had booted football out the door before a club game kickoff , several dozen protesters staged a sitdown strike on the 50yard line ban the ball read their placards , in english and in greek other students preferred to watch the game , failing to agree that football was a unit of the militaryindustrial complex football si , oddballs no , was their chant according to , the dean of students rebuked the antifootball protestors as dogmatists who would n't let other people have their fun club football continued , and , finally , after a petition drive , the counterrevolution was complete with the game restored as a varsity sport in 1969 no immediate danger of a return to gridiron glory presented itself a sparrow , not a phoenix , emerged from the ashes mike lockhart had been a football star in high school i told coach hass i did n't want to go out for the team unless i was going to play , and he smiled and said i could probably start at 11 different positions that s how it was , some good players and some others who did n't even know all the rules gary leland , at about 215 pounds , was a lineman on offense and defense it was n't that i was so big , he said it s just that no one else was bigger the 1969 team was 24 , a respectable enough record , though five opponents were the junior varsities of small colleges like wheaton and valparaiso whatever the caliber of play , a few hundred students attended the games the university was known more for eggheads than big biceps , and at halftime , instead of a marching band , a giant kazoo was brought onto the field fans followed with smaller versions of the instrument , moving about haphazardly rather than in formation , an activity meant to celebrate the concept of brownian motion , the random movement of particles people were there as much for the giant kazoo as the football , recalled the cheerleader ramona lauda the university s reputation for ascetic intellectualism was wryly acknowledged one cheer was themistocles , thucydides the peloponnesian war xsquared , ysquared h2so4 who for \? what for \? who we gonna yell for \? go maroons ! chicago won only seven more games in the next six years wally hass was improving the schedule faster than we were improving the team , said center charlie nelson one of the early squads had a nose tackle who weighed but 135 pounds , so there was a kind of heroism in taking the field , like hector preparing to fight achilles , remembered jeff rasley , himself an undersize volunteer on the 1974 team , which was 08 patsies from the past now reared up in predation in the 1974 homecoming game , with the legendary halfback jay berwanger , the first winner of what is now the heisman trophy , in the stands , the maroons were thrashed by oberlin , 690 berwanger was too gracious to say anything , rasley recalled besides , chicago claimed a moral victory that day when oberlin missed an extra point we were n't a great team but we had great fun , said bob yovovich , a middle linebacker in 1970 and 1971 i know this is mouthing the party line , but it was also a tremendous learning experience that s where hutchins was mistaken , former players agreed the game does build character players do learn how to lead they do learn how to follow there was nothing inherently wrong with football during the first 25 years of what university record keepers call the modern era , chicago s football team had but two winning seasons given the university s chesty reputation for academic rigor , all that losing might well have been welcomed as a scholarly credential but in the past few decades , it has been trying to modify its longstanding image as the place where fun goes to die football may not be synonymous with fun , but in the united states attending a game on a crisp autumn afternoon is widely considered a significant part of the college experience winning seems to make the activity more pleasant in the '80s we were losing students who wanted a better quality of student life , and part of the solution was athletics , more coaches , better facilities , said tom weingartner , who has been the athletic director for 21 years maloney , who is enormously personable , was hired he had coached at the professional level in canada he had worked in the ivy league people asked me if i had a death wish , coming here to chicago , he said but this was an opportunity there was an interest in not going 28 every year but winning requires a recalibration of emphases successful recruiting is essential to get able players , maloney said he or members of his staff visited prospects in not only neighboring states but also california , new jersey , texas and florida they look at video of 3 , 000 players to compile a database of 700 athletes , of which they will pursue 200 in order to reel in 25 chicago s recruiting pitch carries the element of surprise , though that s hardly an advantage i did n't even know they played football , said nate williams , a senior offensive lineman who grew up only 30 miles from the university maloney pursues high school players who may have been allregion or allconference but who are two inches too short or a halfsecond too slow to play at a major college the depth of this talent pool drops immensely when it is further winnowed to students with superior grades and test scores when maloney wants a player , he said , he brings the athlete s academic file to the admissions office , where the only advantage i get is quick service but at chicago , as at most of the nation s elite universities , a football player has the advantage of a big pair of cleats in the door admissions always tells us , there are 500 kids with perfect test scores we turned away , ' maloney said but they also want kids who bring something else to the table sculptors and actors and , yes , football players the maroons have 80 on the team , all recruited , no walkons , maloney said most likely , a purist like hutchins would disapprove of such solicitations , even if twothirds of the team are economics majors and its cumulative grade point average is something like 324 , according to the coach so far this season the maroons are 11 , having dropped their second game to concordia university chicago , a college only a third the size during maloney s 18 years , the team has been 8672 chicago s star player is wide receiver and kick returner dee brizzolara , a junior from aurora , ohio the maroons were not his first choice he said princeton recruited him really hard when he was in high school but he lost his opportunity to play in a big ivy league stadium after an unfortunate runin with the act exam nevertheless , he insists he is happy where he is he seems a cinch to break several of chicago s modern era records and he ran through the list allpurpose yards , receptions , receiving touchdowns , maybe even total scoring but that hardly makes him a big man on campus , he said , shrugging off the very notion he said people hear you 're on the football team and they say , oh yeah , what football team \? really , being a football player at the university of chicago is no different than being anyone else he added , well , except we 're usually larger
detroit the most encouraging element for the on monday occurred not at comerica park , where they scored the winning runs in the ninth inning of their against the , but at a doctor s office 450 miles away in st louis that was where learned that he did not have a rare neurovascular condition that could have sidelined him for the season all of hughes s tests monday came back negative for circulatory and vascular problems , the yankees said the development deepens the mystery regarding hughes s lack of arm strength but spreads a feeling of relief that thoracic outlet syndrome is not the cause i'm not sure if he has that , what they have to do and how long you do n't have him if that s what he has , manager joe girardi said it makes me feel better hughes traveled to st louis to meet with dr robert william thompson , a renowned vascular surgeon , to confirm or to rule out that he had thoracic outlet syndrome now he will return on tuesday to new york , despite having a locker set up for him in the visiting clubhouse , to rehabilitate his shoulder as the yankees redouble their efforts to discover why it feels numb when he pitches in the meantime , the yankees could toast to hughes s health and to the handiwork of nick swisher , who hit to minimize the effect of several missed opportunities \( 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position and 11 base runners stranded \) to jorge posada , who drilled and is showing signs of breaking out of a seasonlong slump and to , who allowed three runs and walked none over seven innings in three starts since taking over for hughes , colon is 20 with a 249 earned run average and 20 strikeouts and 3 walks but he seemed to play down his the importance of his role in hughes s absence i do n't have any idea right now , colon said through an interpreter i just want to keep working hard for the team and help them win that they did , improving to 179 behind strong relief from joba chamberlain and mariano rivera as the tigers continued their downward spiral , losing their seventh consecutive game and wasting a start by their ace , justin verlander the pitching matchup was a study in contrasts the efficient , strikethrowing colon against the hardthrowing , tenacious verlander colon attacked the tigers with fastballs , throwing 40 in a row to begin the game they 're not hitting it , so just keep throwing it , yankees catcher russell martin said of colon s seven strikeouts , five were called , a testament to pitches that move more than a belly dancer , darting away from bats austin jackson was clearly confounded , striking out three straight times but the lighthitting second baseman ramon santiago was not , which was hardly a surprise santiago lashed three hits off colon , improving his career average against him to 550 in 20 atbats , and scored the tigers' second run a new nemesis emerged in alex avila , who hit two basesempty homers , including with one out in the seventh that evened the score at 33 by then , verlander had departed , but only after throwing 127 pitches , the second most in baseball this season heading into monday verlander has said he feels obliged to work deep into games , abhorring the shackles that pitch counts represent no one has averaged more pitches \( 1147 \) per start this season than verlander , according to , and no one throws harder longer , either verlander s final pitch , on a strikeout of derek jeter , was clocked at 99 miles per hour a lot of times you may only get one or two balls and you just start watching the radar gun go higher and higher as he stays in the ball game , curtis granderson said before the game verlander s endurance was as much on the minds of the yankees as his scorching fastball , which zoomed in at an even 100 mph to jorge posada with the bases loaded and two outs in the first inning few opportunities arise against verlander , making it imperative to take advantage practically every pitch this season has tormented posada , who entered the game with three hits in his last 38 atbats but he proved that he can still turn on one of the best fastballs in baseball , launching a pitch from verlander far over jackson s head in center field and onto the warning track two runs scored on the groundrule double , as swisher was sent back to third , but the third run scored soon enough , on a double by eduardo nunez , playing in place of robinson cano \( bruised left hand \) in the second it helps , especially with guys on base , said posada , who added that he felt more comfortable after working with the hitting coach kevin long you feel pretty good about yourself after one atbat it was the first game in detroit for granderson since he was traded in december 2009 , and the favorable , if subdued , greeting initially extended by the fans was toned down in the ninth after falling behind by 02 to jose valverde , granderson fouled off six pitches and worked a 12pitch walk granderson was thrown out at second after sliding past the base on a steal attempt , but his persistence gnawed at valverde , who walked mark teixeira before giving up singles to alex rodriguez and swisher , the latter a sharp grounder up the middle that knocked in the goahead run today was definitely just one of those positive days , you know \? swisher said everything just seemed like things were going to go our way
laura arnez , a mother of five from outside sacramento who likes to refer to her triathlon training as mommy s recess time , has long struggled with panic attacks during the most nerveracking stage of such competitions the openwater swim , which typically precedes a bike race and then a run she fears she is going to drown , amid a sea of flopping arms and fluttering ankles upward of 2 , 000 pairs of each in some instances in my thoughts , i think that someone can go down and no one would know , at least not until everyone is out of the swim , said arnez , 46 , who was a social worker before the first of her children was born nearly two decades ago when i'm out there and i really ca n't breathe , i think that in my head i feel like i'm going to die and so it was that during her first ironman competition at the ford ironman arizona in downtown tempe in november 2009 , one of more than two dozen around the world that year arnez began to lag behind nearly all of the 2 , 500 other participants during the 24mile swim her everpresent anxieties were heightened by an ironman s equivalent of a wardrobe malfunction arnez s goggles kept filling with water from manmade tempe town lake , and no efforts on her part could stop the flow as arnez tried to catch her breath by periodically resting a hand on one of the kayaks patrolling the course , those volunteers watching her could not help wondering would she be able to finish the swim in the allotted 2 hours 20 minutes , or be disqualified before she ever had a chance to climb on her bike for the day s 112mile ride , followed by the 262 marathon run \? \( competitors in an ironman , nearly all of them weekend warriors like arnez , must complete the entire day s journey in 17 hours or less \) nearly two years after arnez participated in her first ironman , her fears of perishing during a triathlon swim persist , and have only been fanned by recent events while the rate of sudden death in triathlons is typically about 15 per every 100 , 000 participants in recent years , according to a study by the american college of cardiology , those deaths are clustered in the swim in august , two people died after participating in the swim portion of one of the nation s most highprofile races , the new york city triathlon , which has a swim course about onethird the distance of an ironman it validates the fears i do have , arnez said in an interview last week the challenges of the ironman openwater swim will be on prominent display saturday , when the sport s world championship is staged in kona , hawaii , near the site of the original race in 1978 that first ironman hatched as a bet over whether swimmers , cyclists or runners were the most fit attracted just 15 participants this year s race will feature just under 1 , 900 , nearly all of whom qualified by placing near the top of their age group in tuneup races over the last year asked last week if the prominence of the swim deaths in new york city had prompted any changes on the part of the organizers of the kona race , andrew messick , the chief executive of world triathlon corporation , which owns it , said no we 're confident kona is safe , he said in the eventuality something happens , we 're able to take good care of our athletes and yet , messick emphasized , the responsibility for determining whether one is ready to do an openwater swim rests with the individual no doctor s clearance is required , although signing an exhaustive legal waiver is in an endurance sport like ironman , or any triathlon , you have to be prepared for the turbulence of an openwater swim , he said it s not something you can necessarily replicate swimming laps at the ymca which , perhaps , raises the question of whatever happened to arnez in her maiden ironman swim , in tempe town lake at 9 17 am that day 2 hours 17 minutes after the swim began , and 3 minutes before the cutoff arnez bounded into view from the shore , a blue kayak to her left and another , red , to her right by that point , one of the kayakborne volunteers had diagnosed the problem with arnez s goggles to ward off the chill of the 64degree water that morning , she had donned three swim caps , one atop the other the layers were so thick that she could not achieve any suction for her goggles a tight seal was forged only after a volunteer slid the caps back off her forehead now , with so much time lost , she still had about 75 feet of water to cross about the length of a standard pool and whether she would make the cutoff was not at all assured indeed , arnez appeared oblivious to how close she was cutting it she kept stopping and looking she would later explain that she was tiring but a woman in one of the kayaks , whom arnez came to regard as her kayak angel , would have none of it kick , kick , kick , the woman implored after what seemed like an eternity , arnez felt a pair of hands grab her on the left side , and another pair on the right tentatively , she found her footing on the stairs leading out of the lake and onto shore finally , mercifully , pulling her goggles off her face for good , arnez brought the digital watch on her left wrist toward her face and tried , as best she could , to focus on the time it had taken her to complete the swim two hours 19 minutes she was so stunned at how close she had come to missing the swim cutoff that she began to sob later , she learned that her official time on the swim was 2 19 17 all told , 2 , 516 swimmers finished the swim out of a field of about 2 , 530 arnez s time ranked her 2 , 515th about 20 minutes later , her wetsuit replaced by dry shorts and a longsleeve top , arnez walked her bicycle through the archway that marked the beginning of the 112mile course , for a journey that would be the equivalent of cycling from new york city to philadelphia she was still so dazed she had n't realized she had yet to get on her bike what are you going to do \?

europe s leaders believe they can stave off economic disaster without taking real action they keep pretending that they will not have to ask taxpayers to help shore up fragile banks , that ever larger doses of austerity will let weak economies like greece pay off their debts , and that europe can continue to reap the benefits of monetary union without the shared responsibilities of greater fiscal union no one else believes this not credit markets , which have bid up interest rates on sovereign debt not the international monetary fund , which has warned repeatedly that major banks appear undercapitalized and not the organization for economic cooperation and development , which last week forecast negative growth in the coming quarter for germany , france and italy , the euro zone s three biggest economies the immediate fear is that one or more major european banks may fail confidence is plummeting because they have large holdings of greek , spanish and italian bonds a major bank failure would damage america s economy as well which helps explain the urgent pleas from washington last week for europe to come up with a strategy for recovery and growth treasury secretary timothy geithner met with european finance ministers on friday to talk about what such a strategy might look like but so far , chancellor angela merkel of germany , president nicolas sarkozy of france and prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy have shown none of the political leadership necessary to forge a longterm solution meanwhile , the real world keeps intruding on europe s political fantasies the healthy appearance of major bank balance sheets vanishes when future writedowns and partial defaults are factored in added capital must be set aside for this contingency , and much of it may have to come from public funds in return , governments must demand a share of future profits and a stronger regulatory hand countries like italy and spain already find it impossible to finance their debt without emergency purchases by the european central bank , which is only a temporary solution issuing common european bonds would be a good step since europe as a whole can borrow much more cheaply than its debtor countries most important , european leaders must shift from austerity policies that are leading to recession , not relief they need to stimulate demand in stronger economies , like germany , and defer austerity measures in fragile ones one reason greece keeps missing its deficit targets is that recession is shrinking tax revenues almost as fast as the government can slash spending now italy , whose growth rates have lagged behind europe s for a decade , is being forced to swallow the same bad medicine energizing growth requires not just easier monetary and fiscal policies , but continued pressure for labor market reforms and privatization of inefficient state companies it will also require more centralized coordination of fiscal policy for the euro zone s 17 countries yet most are still dragging their feet at carrying out the modest reforms their leaders agreed to in july there is no time to waste a debt and banking meltdown in europe this fall could fracture the euro and drag the world into renewed recession
durham , nc confronting the challenge of running for reelection while the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high , convened a session of his new jobs council on monday , offering a proposal to train 10 , 000 american engineering students a year in a program focused on filling hightech jobs the program , which mr obama unveiled during a visit to a lighting manufacturer here , would seek to marry private companies with colleges and universities in a bid to encourage students to focus on science , technology , engineering and math degrees right now , there are more than four job seekers for every job opening in america , mr obama said , in remarks at cree inc , which makes led products but when it comes to science and hightech fields , the opposite is true businesses like this tell me they 're having a hard time finding workers to fill their job openings in coming to north carolina to promote his plans to keep hightech , highpaying jobs in this country , mr obama is trying to hang on to a state that he narrowly won in 2008 but highlighting the climb ahead for the president is north carolina s unemployment rate , which was 97 percent in april , the 10th highest in the country the overall national jobless rate in may was 91 percent , up slightly from the month before the world has changed , mr obama said and for a lot of our friends and neighbors , that change has been painful today the single most serious economic problem we face is getting people back to work after his remarks at cree , mr obama met there with members of the jobs council he created two members of the group jeffrey r immelt , the chairman and chief executive of general electric , and kenneth i chenault , the chairman and chief executive of american express laid out , in an oped article in the wall street journal on monday , a few ideas the council is exploring to increase employment but none of the ideas , which included setting up job training initiatives , providing loans to small businesses and trying to increase tourism , contained any groundbreaking proposals to truly bend the curve over the longer term , we need a more strategic view , the two men acknowledged in the article over the next 90 days , we will turn to addressing the actions needed to make a more significant , longerterm impact they said they would deliver recommendations in september focusing on fastgrowth companies , small businesses and the competitiveness of the country s infrastructure it was unclear how mr obama planned to finance his latest jobs proposals the administration is locked in a debate with congressional republicans over longterm spending and deficit reduction , facing an august deadline for a decision on raising the country s  there was a touch of nostalgia to the president s trip on monday he visited the cree headquarters here three years ago , when he was a senator running for the presidency mr obama said his hair was grayer now but , he added , i have a better plane so it s a fair trade after north carolina , mr obama headed to florida , another crucial state for his reelection hopes he has scheduled several fundraisers as part of his effort to raise a record 1 billion during this campaign on tuesday , mr obama is making a rare visit to puerto rico , as part of the democratic party s campaign to woo more hispanic voters back in the mainland united states
detroit this may not bring much comfort to the segment of fandom that covers its eyes whenever walks to the mound on monday , before a 54 loss in game 3 put the yankees on the brink of elimination , burnett summarized his task as the starter for game 4 i 've had good games and bad games during the season you can say the same thing about postseason , but you ca n't count me out i 've got to bring everything i 've got , and just let a j loose out there now , which a j is he talking about \? if it is the one who beat philadelphia with seven strong innings in game 2 of the 2009 world series , or even the one who managed three reasonably effective starts in september , the yankees should be in good shape it had better not be the other burnett , the one who was not good enough to make the threeman postseason rotation in the first place i feel good about what a j is going to do tomorrow , manager joe girardi said in a refreshing moment of honesty , burnett acknowledged he could not blame yankees fans for not trusting him , especially after a second consecutive season with an earned run average above 500 i 've been proving people wrong my whole career , it seems like , said burnett , who was 1111 with a 515 era in the regular season people are entitled to their opinion obviously , i give them reasons here and there to doubt the bottom line is , i have confidence in myself my teammates have confidence in me i'm not going to go out and try to prove anything i'm just trying to win a ballgame derek jeter said , a j has pitched some big games for us and come through when we needed him burnett and girardi insist that burnett accepted girardi s decision to go with , ivan nova and freddy garcia as starters , a plan foiled by last friday night s rain and the suspension of game 1 the one thing you preach when you are a part of a team is you do whatever you can to help your team win , girardi said that was the attitude a j had i 'll do whatever you want obviously , there are things you are more comfortable doing but a j was willing to do whatever we needed the thing is , game 4 might be as much about starter rick porcello , a 22yearold new jersey product who will make his first postseason start , as burnett \( in 2009 , porcello started the division tiebreaker at minnesota as a rookie \) porcello struggled in august , going 12 with a 682 era , before compiling five consecutive quality starts in september to finish 149 and match his rookie victory total i always say you ca n't make a senior out of a freshman , tigers manager jim leyland said he s probably a junior now he s got a ways to go now , but he s good porcello said i'm ready to go i want to get out there and show everybody what i can do so does burnett on his laptop , he plans to watch video of his two starts against detroit earlier this season both were decent a 106 victory on april 2 at yankee stadium in which he allowed three runs in five innings with six strikeouts , and a 63 loss here may 5 that was the game in which burnett had a nohitter for five innings only two of the five tigers runs charged to burnett were earned , as burnett and the backup shortstop eduardo nunez made throwing errors himself none of the tigers with 10 or more career atbats against burnett have hit him well miguel cabrera , burnett s former teammate in florida , is 3 for 14 \( 214 \) with two doubles and no home runs burnett s career 717 era at comerica park mainly stems from two bad outings for toronto in september 2006 and april 2007 , when he gave up 11 earned runs in eight and a third innings i'm not going to go out and try to prove anything , burnett said i'm going to go out and try to win a ballgame
istanbul as economic contagion tarnishes the , a newly assertive is increasingly looking east instead of west , and asking a vexing question should turkey reject europe before europe rejects turkey \? when , the charismatic prime minister , first swept to power in 2002 , he made turkey s entry into the european union his overriding goal determined to anchor the country to the west , mr erdogan s musliminspired justice and development party tackled thorny issues like improving minority rights and easing restrictions on free speech to move turkey closer to western norms but turkey s bid was greeted with skepticism and even disdain by some members of the union , not least because of turkey s large , almost entirely muslim population the negotiations dragged on endlessly without ever yielding a clear pathway to membership now it is turkey that has soured on the idea , analysts here say with europe shaken by a spiraling credit crisis and the tumult of the arab spring creating opportunities for turkey to wield new clout as a regional power , people here are weighing a step that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago walking away from the european union altogether prime minister erdogan wanted to be the first conservative muslim leader who would bring turkey to the west , but after europe betrayed him , he abandoned those ambitions , said erol yarar , the founder of a religiously conservative business group of 20 , 000 companies that is close to the prime minister today , the eu has absolutely no influence over turkey , and most turks are asking themselves , why should we be part of such a mess \? ' turkey s increasingly muscular foreign policy in the middle east was in evidence last week when it imposed tough sanctions on syria and made preparations for possible military intervention and turkey has become a powerful voice of regional outrage over israel s treatment of , especially since it froze its ties with israel over a commando raid on a vessel that tried to reach gaza from turkey meanwhile , turkish officials say relations with the european union have reached a state of hopeless disrepair , made worse by the prospect of cyprus taking over the rotating presidency of the union next year turkey has been locked in an intractable political fight with cyprus since 1974 , when it invaded the island to prevent a proposed union with greece and set up a rival government in the ethnic turkish part of cyprus that only it recognizes in london last month , president disparaged cyprus as half a country that would lead a miserable union , milliyet , a turkish newspaper , reported then , when france took the unusual step last week of proposing that turkey be invited to take part in a meeting of the union s foreign ministers to discuss syria , cyprus vetoed the idea a century ago when the was crumbling , turkey acquired the unwelcome nickname the sick man of europe now many turks cannot help but gloat that turkey s economy is forecast to grow at a 75 percent rate this year while europe is sputtering those who called us sick' in the past are now sick' themselves , zafer caglayan , turkey s minister of economy , said recently may god grant them recovery it is all but certain that turkey s membership talks , which have made scant progress in many areas since 2006 , will make none at all when cyprus takes over the union s rotating presidency in july 2012 , because the turkish government has said it will boycott the presidency , effectively freezing negotiations if the talks are still deadlocked in 2014 , turkish officials say privately , they could be abandoned public opinion in turkey has already turned away according to surveys by the german marshall fund , 73 percent of turks saw membership as a good thing in 2004 , but only 38 percent felt that way by 2010 the country s minister for european union affairs , egemen bagis , said in an interview that turkey remained committed to joining with its young and dynamic work force , large domestic market and growing regional role , he said , turkey would be a bigger asset than ever to the teetering union hold on , europe , he said , turkey is coming to the rescue but business people in turkey , who have long supported membership , are finding it harder to make the case mr yarar , the business group leader , owns 404 , a chemical company , and lezzo , a food company , which makes the country s wellknown apple tea he noted that turkey s trade patterns were shifting eastward though europe still bought about 56 percent of turkey s exports in 2010 , some 20 percent went to the middle east , compared with 125 percent in 2004 it may take 10 years , but the arab spring will make these markets even more attractive , he said cooler relations with turkey are costing europe influence in the arab world , where turkey , a nato member bordered by iran , iraq and syria , is fast becoming an important interlocutor for the west for the first time in decades , analysts say , europe needs turkey more than turkey needs europe to the protesters in the streets of cairo or homs , mr erdogan , a pious muslim leading a prosperous country of 78 million , is a powerful symbol of the compatibility of democracy and islam , while europe s perceived hostility to its muslim residents undercuts its influence in the region senior turkish officials say that mr erdogan has turned away from europe and embraced washington instead , a development signaled when turkey announced sanctions against syria while mr erdogan coordinated closely on the issue with president obama , the officials said , europe played only a supporting role the waning of european influence may also corrode turkey s ambition to be a model of democracy for the arab world human rights advocates say that without the viable prospect of european union membership to motivate restraint , the turkish government s authoritarian streak is growing unchecked a report by the european commission in november said that 64 journalists were in jail in turkey , and one prominent media group that has criticized the ruling party was hit with a 25 billion tax fine in this abidingly cosmopolitan city , though , even ambitious and welleducated young people are fed up with the european union at a bustling cafe on the western side of the bosporus , the strait that cuts through the city and separates europe from asia , tugce erbad , 19 , a student of international finance , said her generation of turks was not interested in joining a sinking european union yet she insisted that she and her friends were still more drawn to europe than to the arab world i would rather go to paris than beirut , she said , before quickly adding turkey is neither east or west we are moving in our own direction
cottonwood heights , utah on christmas day in 1964 , the day before darius a gray was to be baptized as a mormon , he learned that the church would not allow a black man , like him , to be in the priesthood i was not amused , mr gray recalled with a rueful smile it was last saturday , and we were sitting with about 300 other mormons , including dozens of children , at the annual picnic of the , a social organization for black mormons and their friends some were latino or american indian , and nearly half were white , the parents and siblings of adopted black children it was the most racially integrated church event i had ever attended having been introduced to mormonism by kindly white neighbors in his hometown of colorado springs , the teenage darius read his way through much of the scripture of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints he had no idea about the racist church policy his newfound faith was badly shaken i went home and prayed , mr gray said and i received a personal revelation , an inspiration from god this is the restored gospel , and you are to join' so the next day , i entered into the waters of baptism then the next day i went to church as a member for the first time and a little girl addressed him using a certain racial epithet that was a first , too i am not unaware , continued mr gray , a bearded man with the smooth baritone of the television journalist he used to be , of the bigotries and biases of people in this country , and in this church but i have a counter to that , which is the assurance from god that this is the restored gospel by restored mr gray was referring to the belief that joseph smith s book of mormon completed the message of old and new testaments in 1830 since that time , mormonism has grown to more than 14 million members , according to the church , including many africans converted by missionaries but it was only in 1978 that the church opened up the priesthood to all worthy male members , no matter their race the genesis group was chartered by church leaders in 1971 , and it is one of several organizations for black mormons and their friends mr gray said he knew of other groups in california and ohio the genesis group s picnic in a salt lake city suburb is a small correction to the stereotype , largely accurate , of american mormonism as lilywhite the church says it does not keep records of membership by race a happy tangle of young children played in the park s playground short afros , cornrows , fine blond hair taking breaks to eat hot dogs and hamburgers and drink lemonade , but not caffeinated soda , this being a mormon event i hung back with the parents , listening to their stories a tall man wearing rainbow suspenders told me he likes the genesis group even though he is white and has no children they 're just friendly , said the man , wayne richardson so i come to help i help set up the food he said that when he was a missionary in alabama in 1975 , he was not allowed to baptize a black maid they would not allow it , mr richardson said she wanted to learn the church teachings , and we were told not to we were there to work with the rich whites mr richardson could not remember who had forbidden him to baptize the woman , but he said the message had been clear jerri a harwell , who is married to the president of the genesis group , said the singers donny and marie osmond , famous mormons , first made her curious about the religion as ms harwell recalls , it was 1976 , and she was away at college and eager for mail i was watching the family and other living things , ' a mormonproduced television show in which the osmonds appeared they said at the end of the program , would you like more information \? ' i thought , oh , i can get some mail ms harwell received a mailing about mormonism , then sent back a reply card requesting further information within days , two male missionaries turned up at her door they did n't know i was black , she said the missionaries were taken aback , asked me , do you really want to be taught \? ' i thought that was odd it was only later i learned they were n't supposed to proselytize among blacks ms harwell studied with them for months and was baptized in 1977 , less than a year before the church lifted its ban on blacks in the priesthood in 1980 , she became one of the first africanamerican women to be a mormon missionary , serving in houston she now teaches at a community college and performs a onewoman show about jane manning james , a black mormon pioneer who helped settle utah in the 1840s max perry mueller , who is writing a dissertation at harvard on africanamericans and the mormon church , and who attended the genesis group picnic last year , says that the church has made a very sincere effort to welcome blacks , but that so far few americanborn blacks have joined the church mr mueller also said that the idea that mormons were until recently exceptionally exclusionary or racist is probably unfair while no other large , predominantly white church barred blacks from the clergy in the 1970s , none was particularly integrated or had notable black leaders , either but history was not on anybody s agenda at the cookout i met a white man who had just adopted his eighth child , a black infant named henry i met sergio orozco , a halfhispanic and halfamerican indian from new mexico , who said for a native american , being mormon is great the book of mormon teaches that the ancient inhabitants of american came from jerusalem , he said so being lds latterday saint is close to our roots and i met a former southern baptist preacher , a white man with a real dixie accent , who became a mormon after moving to utah i asked him how that happened , and he said , i got lucky !
if your online bracket doesn t let you select a winner for a game , then said game doesn t count using that logic , tuesday and wednesday didn t count for better or worse , the ncaa tournament doesn t begin until cbs gets involved , and as a general rule of thumb , i normally don t watch basketball games that are sandwiched between episodes of world s dumbest criminals \( looking at you , trutv \) with that being said , having the price is right \( the drew carey version \) and judge judy \( the judge judy version \) as your programming bookends doesn t solve the problem either the only way to escape your fate is to set your dvr to explode or you could heed the advice of the red hot chili peppers and throw away your television altogether if neither of those suggestions seems like a good idea , i guess you could just change the channel and wait for the next round of games to air continue reading for live updates and analysis you re on your own for the late games we ll be back tomorrow with all of the action for friday enjoy the rest of your st patrick s day and thanks for following along with us much less drama in the early evening games as the top seeds took care of business brackets are looking a little less disastrous than they were two hours ago what s often ignored is how many shots jimmer takes he s 9 of 22 for 25 points in the nba , that s probably acceptable for your star in college , there s usually a higher premium on efficiency not many of the other player of the year candidates get that many field goal attempts \( the major exception being kemba walker \) having a good change of pace or shiftiness to your game can be more useful than being a topflight athlete jimmer s natural hesitation is what allows him to get open looks and lets him get to the basket it s impossible to prepare for unless there s someone on your team that possesses the same shiftiness byu going on a run to open up the second half jimmer has that same jj aura where we don t get to seem him dunk and so we get really excited when he gets a breakaway i think jimmer could have turned that last layup over into a dunk florida is giving us one of the few games today that doesn t involve fans sweating ucsb might be crying due to florida s brutality , but the overall nation of fans needed some time to catch their collective breath jimmer should start his own line of bbq sauce i think it would do insanely well in the mountain time region check that uconn game is already taken care of \( jinx test \) bucknell freshman cameron ayers , brother of former notre dame guard ryan ayers , is one of the siblings that doesn t get much airplay i played with ryan at notre dame , and watching cameron on the court freaks me out they move exactly the same way nature or nurture i cannot say i don t think bucknell has enough fire power to hang with uconn , but there s nothing like watching your friend s sibling to make you feel old and past your prime they don t scare you jimmer might scare you but as a team , byu doesn t scare anyone the absence of brandon davies exacerbates that issue how long does it take till superstars start getting superstar calls \? having the benefit of the doubt from refs probably accounts for at least 68 points per game jimmer certainly gets the benefit of the doubt he deserves it , of course , but it would be interesting to see what his scoring average would be if he wasn t jimmer fredette adam in dc bucknell is the first team today to have a clear advantage in fan support here if this one stays close , the bison will earn some new fans as the night progresses from adam in dc just spotted the the former connecticut star donyell marshall at the burger king walkup window across the street from the verizon center he s here to cheer for his huskies , who are about to tip off against bucknell didn t stick around long enough to see if he asked for a paper crown out of all the top seeds to play today , florida out to the best and most definitive start of the tournament maybe the committee knows what it s doing or maybe ucsanta barbara doesn t know what it s doing florida s tournament draw is considered by many to be the most favorable with a tournament based heavily on luck , it ll be interesting to see if florida can take advantage of their draw and if parsons will take advantage of a barber at some point during the weekend if you put product in your hair before the game or ever , you re not allowed to play in the ncaa tournament you have to get a shot off coming out of a timeout get a charge even a turnover shouldn t happen in that situation , especially since richmond wasn t exactly playing a trapping defense those are the types of plays that keep you from being in a position to win looks like we have our first 512 upset with richmond over vandy kevin anderson almost made that andone play into a viral video as he was about six inches away from accidentally punching the ref in the face during his celebration can t blame him for that , can you \? they get you jump started when things have slowed down richmond s kevin anderson has scored 9 points in less than two minutes and has his team up three vanderbilt needs to get the ball out of his hands and force other players to make plays when two guys average the bulk of the scoring , i don t understand why they don t get maximum attention leaving these guys open for a second is asking to lose i know a lot of people that picked richmond as their 512 upset momentum currently swinging their way regardless , it looks headed towards another close finish tied with less than 12 to go from adam in dc props to the uncasheville fans , busting ou the defense chants down by 23 with 30 seconds left from adam in dc either butler fans knew they d be facing pittsburgh in the next round or just wanted to get their st patrick s day party on , because their section at the verizon center is empty at least someone is starting to pull away pitt up 17 with less than 8 to go sports writers not pulling their hair out on sideline escapes just give me one blowout to catch my breath , please this tournament is fixed to be extra awesome there s no other way to explain all the incredibly finishes it s mathematically impossible can you help us with some statistical analysis , nate silver \? ok , they have athletes but they are painful to watch in the half court terrible shot selection , forced plays that kind of play isn t going to get them very far in this tournament you can always count on an ivy league team being good cutters a good cut and a good pass combo is one of the most beautiful things to watch in basketball and makes a defense feel completely naked just over four to go , princeton not going away down three and at the line shooting two kentucky is starting to flash their athleticism my heart is honestly too weak for this kentucky with the lead with less than 9 minutes to go with every play , princeton is getting more and more confident , and that s not a good thing for a young and inexperienced kentucky team if you have a bracket , it s time to cut your loses and start watching the food network if princeton wins this game , i m going to destroy my television not because i d be mad , but because what would be the point in watching another day of sports ever \? it s not going to get better than this if you re a sports fan i hope all other sports join the nfl in the lockout and we switch to having two college basketball seasons this tournament is too much to handle three gamewinners already \? the entire body of sports media is going to explode this is why the first weekend is better than any other weekend of the tournament less than a week ago , i said that louisville had an outside chance of winning it all \( out of the big east teams that had a chance \) they go from playing extremely well in the big east tournament to laying an egg in the big one that s why arguing over brackets using any other justification than a ceelo influenced forget insert team is silly anything can happen in this tournament what west virginia giveth , louisville taketh away big east drops to 11 with louisville s loss to morehead st the second photo finish of the day and it s still daytime and i can t do it onions ! ! ! b raftery from patrick in dc not as many pittsburgh fans here as i thought there would be this is no zoo crew if you have two full arm sleeves of tattoos , you shouldn t have perfectly manicured facial hair it s sending mixed signals to society back to back buckets for louisville s terrence jennings has cut morehead s lead to one peyton siva needs to try and get in the lane every single remaining offensive possession , especially since it looks like knowles will not be returning i m not saying bill raftery should be president , but he should be at least some kind of spokesman or ambassador i think he could smooth a lot of things over knowles hurt , siva in foul trouble someone for louisville is going to have to step up a la dalton pepper that means you , mike marra ty proffitt is familiar with the big east he started his career at notre dame and transfered after his first year he has 11 points and 3 threes so far , and has morehead st just one point behind the favored cardinals usually there s been some kind of blow out at this point of the day not one of these games will let you take your eye off the action for one moment weak field better entertainment louisville is forcing some terrible passes not once during the big east week did i see them try and force the overthetop pass to jennings down low players are too long and athletic on the weak side for that pass to be effective without quick ball reversal , which louisville hasn t had patrick checks in from dc an offensive rebound was a fitting way to conclude the game butler did a great job on the boards all afternoon , and really won this one for all the reasons most thought the bulldogs would lose old dominion is the no 1 rebounding team in the nation peyton siva needs to do a better job of protecting himself when he leaves his feet part of what makes him so effective attacking the basket is his fearlessness , but that also gets him into trouble when he makes contact with other defenders on that last play , he was bumped not maliciously and crashed to the floor he s going to be feeling that fall for a week or so adam from dc after review , matt howard s buzzerbeater is good , and butler wins 6058 afterward , a fan threw a full bottle of soda onto the court that nearly struck old dominion s kent bazemore butler s matt howard with the first buzzer beater of the tournament pending review trutv alert old dominion down 2 with the ball and 36 seconds left timeout west virginia s win a good start for the world s best college conference \( that s a fair call , right \? \) news from charlotte mike krzyzewski has said that kyrie irving will play in duke s opening game against hampton on friday like west virginia , louisville struggled most of the first half but has somehow found a way to tie the game going into half time a last second three from morehead st forced the tie at the buzzer and until the 34 second mark , had led the entire way look for louisville to come out in the second half and assert themselves no way pitino is taking it easy on them for this halftime talk adam from dc foul trouble becoming an issue for butler shelvin mack and andrew smith both have four and matt howard has three i promise this post won t have a pun on the last name pepper dalton pepper has come out of nowhere with three huge defensive plays turned into offense , and has given wvu a 9point lead with just over a minute to play these are the types of performances teams need to advance in this tournament no one was talking about pepper before or during most of this game and with his play in the last couple minutes , he s one of the players of the game it s sad that basketball is taking on the flop culture of soccer thanks , europe from patrick in dc this one looks like it will be decided in the last seconds fouls starting to pile up , could be won lost at the free throw line basketball is the only sport that eliminates player participation for petty offenses instead of fouling out , how about we institute some kind of penalty box situation five fouls two minute penalty each subsequent foul one minute penalty having to take key players sit out due to fouls is ridiculous adam checks in again from dc old dominion will be in double bonus for last 10 minutes 17 seconds the monarchs are 13 of 17 from the foul line so far and can expect quite a few more trips before we re done here nothing says fan like a sweater vest embroidered with team logo , aside from unfortunately placed tattoos and my guess is the that if you have one , you have the other an announcer that ll remain nameless \( because i don remember his name \) , upon seeing devin booker s tip dunk , exclaimed , booker with the rack attack ! when i find out his name , i m going to put him on rhyming probation it s too late in the game for clemson to be trading baskets with west virginia , and with how many of those baskets are coming at the rim for the mountaineers , it would seem as if fatigue is officially setting in on those clemson legs refs across the country are constantly being tricked by the acting jobs of point guards it seems like there s been an increase this year in pgs stressing incidental contact , and they ve been rewarded with tickytack foul calls if ratings ever do drop for the tournament , i think they should introduce a rule where tournament teams can use one alumnus for five minutes a game because why not we already have the charge call and fouling out , let s add something else to increase the parody and frustration i think it s time to retire the airball chant we all know what happened don t narrate i d rather see the student section start the wave it s amazing what confidence can do to a player s game truck bryant s swagger is coming through in full 1080p hd right now and it s infecting his entire team west virginia is thus far dominating the second half and has a 7point lead from adam in dc old dominion forward frank hassell had 8 points in the first half hassell has always been a ferocious rebounder , but over the past two years , he s really developed his shooting touch he credits much of his improvement to the former nba allstar bob dandridge , a fourthround pick of the milwaukee bucks in 1969 dandridge reached out to hassell last summer , and dandridge told hassell to google him to find out who he was the two worked together to refine hassell s post moves and turnaround jumpshot i was talking to some basketball guys last night and the prevailing wisdom seems to be this stupid plays lose more games than smart plays win bad shots , not boxing out , unforced turnovers all stupid plays wake up , clemson john branch , via twitter anthem , then locker room kenneth faried stopped for a long embrace with mom , waudda read about them here http nytims eyte4y brett mcmurphy is covering the games in tampa today west virginia takes first lead of day on kevin jones tip in clemson you guessed it fell asleep on the boards from late night writer eric stangel follow eric ericstangel on twitter calling a foul on a rebound is equivalent to holding in football yes , there s probably a foul on every single play , yet the refs seem to always call the worst ones if it s obvious , call it if not , let it go i think it would be quicker to list the companies that aren t sponsors of the tournament can t we just get one disclaimer everything you have ever purchased somehow sponsors this tournament , so keep buying stuff got it adam himmelsbach is also in dc and checks in with some stats from butlerold dominion old dominion leads the nation with a 122 rebounding margin , but butler is holding its own on the glass , being outrebounded just 1413 at the half nothing beats the first two days of the tournament the quantity of games , the parody everything is downhill from here the final four always seems anticlimactic patrick behan checks in again from dc butler s matt howard just picked up his second foul 40 feet from the hoop he joins his fellow big man andrew smith on the bench we will see if odu takes advantage follow pete petethamelnyt on twitter zach has mentioned that butler coach brad stevens , 34 , looks even younger this year than last old dominion coach blaine taylor is sporting a different look  connor ennis after an entire half of being outplayed , west virginia s kevin jones hits a three at the end to tie that game at 40 a piece this is why you can t lose your focus against big east teams west virginia has to be feeling good going into the locker room first five minutes of the second half will be interesting clemson has already forced seven , and as far as i m concerned , an offensive rebound is a turnover , which would bring clemson s total to ten west virginia isn t efficient enough on offense to give clemson that many opportunities as frustrating as it was when cbs used to switch between games , this multiple broadcast format is overwhelming do tv s have pictureinpicture anymore \? patrick behan checks in from washington at the second tv timeout , old dominion has begun to assert itself inside the fans are getting noisy too it s a good atmosphere for the team from virginia right now west virginia can t run with clemson the mountaineers as are many big east teams are built more like a football team than a basketball team scratch that whole push the tempo thing if you re wvu they need to try and make this a grind it out affair game s tempo is starting to pick up , and clemson is showing no signs of slowing down i don t see either team opening up a big lead in this one , but if west virginia trails for the rest of the game , i don t know if they ll have enough ondemand offense at the end to get over the hump could have our first 512 upset of the tournament in game one welcome to the ncaa tournament how does brad stevens look younger than he did last year \? he must be spending some of his new contract on beauty products that or he s just been watching more nickelodeon the rims in tampa are looking ridiculously soft twentyfive foot jumpers are hitting the rim and just sitting there those are the kind of things you can never prepare for shots that shouldn t go in , will rebounds that should bounce , won t any announcer that makes an intentionally vague reference to jonnie west s father should be fired his dad was jerry west just say it first game is at the second media timeout and clemson has been the better team so far they re playing harder and smarter wvu making chuck barkley look like a rocket scientist clemson 18 wvu 10 wvu s deniz kilicli was called for a traveling after a crabsteplike move if he was still back in turkey , no one would have batted an eyelash overseas , you can get away with taking a seemingly infinite amount of steps it looks like rugby , if in rugby you called fouls on every single play west virginia looks completely unorganized you absolutely cannot give up wideopen transition threes after a made basket completely unforgivable it s plays like those that drive coaches crazy and keep them awake at night i hate negative sports commentary with that being said , neither of these teams will win the whole thing and that s ok it would be interesting to see how far people have one of these teams going in the bracket prove me wrong , wvu clemson west virginia s truck bryant is the key to this west virginia offense third in scoring and second in assists , if he shoots the ball well , west virginia becomes a different team and that s good if he can t get it going offensively west virginia will have difficulty finding an offensive flow against conventional wisdom , clemson is currently playing with more energy than west virginia it ll be interesting to see if they can maintain it through the game with a record eleven teams in the tournament , the pressure is on the big east to prove that their bids are deserved in the past couple of years , the big east has underperformed against expectations , and it would be good for the league to have west virginia get off to a good start chuck barkley is already on the big east hate train , calling the conference the most overrated in the country i don t know if i follow his logic i hope i never do just because the other conferences don t pack as much of a punch across the board , it doesn t mean that the big east is overrated still love you , chuck \( yeah , he s reading this \) i haven t seen much of clemson this year , but i have seen west virginia west virginia likes to employ a switching defense , and that can be hard to play against if you don t have the right plays to counter that action clemson at a distinct disadvantage in this one as they ve had to play this week already in a playin game and travel from clemson to dayton to tampa wouldn t be surprised to see them start sluggishly west virginia should have something in their game plan that increases the tempo early to test the legs of clemson good to see all three ernie , kenny , and chuck on the panel i think the stage design is a touch too stuffy for these guys i hope they can still let their hair down i miss the days when watching the price is right meant that you had a day off from school and not that you are primarily unemployed just to paint the picture , today i ll be live blogging from the comfort of my living room technically , i m pretty sure i m allowed to measure the square footage and declare it a workspace , deduct the proportional amount from my mortgage , and then have that as a tax writeoff if that didn t make any sense , don t worry , because it s not my living room and i don t have a mortgage i live in a house with my mother some would call it living at home regardless , i m still going to measure the square footage and deduct the proportional amount of embarrassment guilt that i experience on a daily basis from this situation , which means that today i ll be in a tremendous mood and that should lead to some topnotch analysis fifteen minutes till tip off as i wait for the first round of games to air , i find myself wishing i could reach every team playing in this first session if i could reach them , the advice i would give them is this don t lose obvious , i know but as a former loser of a firstround , firstsession game , i can tell you that being ousted in the morning makes it seem like you weren t even a part of the tournament yes , the initial excitement was there from selection sunday to the travel to the new city but losing on thursday makes you feel like clark w griswold you packed family and luggage into the family truckster , navigated every roadblock and dealt with every setback , only to eventually reach wally world and come to the crushing realization that it s closed unfortunately for ncaa tournament first round \( technically second round \) losers , there s no talking rubber moose to punch in the nose , and john candy won t be there for hostage purposes \( darn you , movies , for giving us false hope \) what you re left with is the reality that after an entire season of r sum building , it s now over before you ve even had lunch and back to the unemployment line you go for another 51 weeks so whether it s trutv , cbs , tbs or ted turner holding a flip video camera , be ready to play , advance , and make your trip worthwhile
houston and his players passed a legion of newfound fans as they walked off the court saturday night and stepped into an uncertain future as life in richmond returns to normal in the weeks and months that follow vcu s 7062 loss to butler in the final four , there will be one question hovering over the program what is next \? in our program , we are going to continue to build , smart said moments afterward we 've got a lot of things that we still want to accomplish this was a terrific run are we capable of doing it again \? sure but among the uncertainties ahead for vcu including the complexion of the team after losing four key seniors perhaps none is more important than smart s future smart has avoided questions about opportunities that may arise from his success , but they surely will not subside in the near future athletic director norwood teague said in a recent telephone interview that he was aware of the interest in smart he also said that vcu , which started the villa 7 consortium to help network with upandcoming assistant coaches , was aware of the candidates out there if the university needed to replace smart in a matchup that showcased the rise of midmajors , butler \( 289 \) was thorough and composed and manhandled the rams in the paint , showing some of the traits that have led the bulldogs to backtoback appearances in the national championship game while the senior forward jamie skeen scored 27 for vcu \( 2812 \) , point guard joey rodriguez played uneven , and the rams got themselves into foul trouble butler grabbed 16 more rebounds and never allowed vcu to play with its preferred uptempo pace their program s rock solid , smart said of butler they 've got a great coach they 've got a great system they have players that every time they take the floor do so with a clear head perhaps the most important players the rams will lose are skeen , rodriguez and guard brandon rozzell , the senior leaders smart removed all three with 204 seconds to play to a standing ovation from vcu fans as for the future , the bar has been set high for those guys , rozzell said in an otherwise silent locker room who knows \? i think they could get there vcu attracted a circuslike atmosphere last week as the team prepared for its first final four appearance lines snaked around the campus bookstore as students waited to purchase apparel fans stopped players on their way to class to ask for autographs the rams defeated teams from the pacific10 \( southern california \) , the big east \( georgetown \) , the big ten \( purdue \) , the atlantic coast conference \( florida state \) and the big 12 \( kansas \) before arriving at the final four sent the message that we 're pretty good , that we 're good enough to make it this far , smart said of the midmajors' performance i think college basketball s evolved over the past two , three decades vcu s success made smart a central figure of march his stock as one of the hottest young coaches in the country also soared , surely making him a prime candidate for future job opportunities smart s predecessor , anthony grant , left for alabama in 2009 after taking vcu to two ncaa tournament appearances in three years and so vcu headed for home after a season that will be recalled for years but there are more pressing topics of conversation in the immediate future for vcu , starting with whether the rams' remarkable journey might cost them their coach
cairo by telephone , i reached a family in tripoli , libya , with deep roots in the armed forces there , and members of the family offered some insight into what we should do to help nudge col muammar elqaddafi from power one member of the family is a senior naval officer who says that his ship and two others were ordered to sail to the major city of benghazi , by the boats were instructed to attack benghazi , he said , speaking through an englishspeaking family member some of the senior officers were aghast at the idea of attacking civilians but feared summary execution if they disobeyed orders , by his account in that tense situation , the officer said , four officials supporting colonel qaddafi staged a rally for him on the naval base other officers then hushed them up without explicitly condemning the government , my contact said , and there was a fierce argument that ended with the proqaddafi group giving way because it was far outnumbered by the antiqaddafi forces , and in theory the naval officers accepted their orders , my contact said but in practice they have not yet set sail i ca n't say more for fear of getting some very brave people in trouble likewise , in another phone call to tripoli , i was given firsthand information about an air force unit in the tripoli area that is staying on base and refraining from getting involved in the fighting one way or the other the unit s leaders do n't dare disobey orders directly , but they are waiting and watching and sitting out the fighting for now those are the people we need to send signals to libyan military officers who are wavering about which way to turn their guns we should n't invade libya , but there are steps the international community can take that may make a difference by influencing these officers who have n't yet committed , the , the and others have laid out sensible steps that countries can take these include  offer a safe haven for libyan pilots ordered to bomb their country for example , they could be encouraged to land on airstrips in malta or neighboring countries even if not many took advantage of the offer , colonel qaddafi might be more reluctant to dispatch his air force if he thought he might lose it  impose financial and trade sanctions on libya , , and freeze assets of the qaddafi family in particular , military exchanges and weapons transfers should be canceled sanctions take time to bite \( aside from a cutoff from the global banking system \) , but they would signal to those around colonel qaddafi that he is going down and they should not obey his orders  impose a nofly zone , after he defected , to prevent the government from bombing or strafing its own people this is what we did to prevent saddam hussein from attacking his kurdish population , and in libya we could do it without dispatching nato aircraft to hover continually over the region we can warn libya \( publicly or quietly \) that if military aircraft or ships are used against civilians , libya s military assets will later be destroyed the aim is to encourage the air force and navy to keep their assets from being used against civilians  encourage the arab league and african union to continue to pressure libya in connection with the killing of its people such efforts undermine colonel qaddafi s nationalist warnings that this is about foreign powers trying to recolonize libya and encourage his aides to appreciate that he is losing all his allies  seek a referral by the united nations security council to the international criminal court for the prosecution of colonel qaddafi for crimes against humanity skeptics will note that none of these moves would convince colonel qaddafi to be any more genteel and these are uncertain levers , creating some risk that he would respond by going after citizens of the united states but there are two reasons why i think it s very important to pull these levers the first is that so many libyans have defected or seem to be wavering that military family in tripoli estimates that only 10 percent of those in the libyan armed forces are behind colonel qaddafi and the rest are wondering what to do next the second is that as this democracy uprising spreads , other despots may be encouraged to follow colonel qaddafi s example we need to make very sure that the international reaction is so strong and the scorchedearth strategy so unsuccessful that no other despot is tempted to declare war on his own people so let s not sit on our hands
one year into its tenure , the mets new front office is continuing to make emphatic moves in recent weeks , the team announced that terry collins , who recently completed his first season as manager , would be kept on through the 2013 season , and revealed that major alterations to the dimensions of their home stadium , citi field , were likely to be forthcoming and on wednesday , the team announced that ken oberkfell , the bench coach chip hale , the thirdbase coach mookie wilson , the firstbase coach and jon debus , the bullpen coach would not return to those roles for the 2012 season terry and i did sit down and talked about the coaching staff , anticipated the possible loss of chip hale , and for a variety of reasons decided that some changes needed to be made , general manager sandy alderson said wednesday hale declined an offer to remain with the club , and shortly after the mets announcement , the oakland athletics said they had signed him to a twoyear contract to be their bench coach hale worked with a s manager bob melvin when the two were with the arizona diamondbacks and is native of san jose , calif wilson and debus were offered unspecified positions with the club oberkfell was not tim teufel , who managed the organization s class aaa team in buffalo , will become the mets thirdbase coach ricky bones , the pitching coach in buffalo , will become the mets bullpen coach alderson said the other staff additions would be announced in the coming weeks sometimes changes are made for individual reasons , and sometimes they are made for the overall composition of the staff and how it fits together , alderson said for the bench coach job , alderson and collins said they wanted someone with more experience coaching at the major league level oberkfell had served the organization in a variety of capacities , generally in the minor leagues , before becoming the bench coach last season collins said , one of the qualities i d be looking for is a guy who s had some experience in that role , as a bench coach , who s done it before at our level , perhaps a guy who has some familiarity with the league and the majority of players that have been in the major leagues for a while the mets bullpen has been under the spotlight after a disastrous showing this year , and alderson said he thought the coaching role there would be better served by someone who has a pitching background , unlike debus , who had none wilson , meanwhile , served as the outfield and baserunning instructors , two areas for the mets that also left much to be desired mookie was responsible for the outfield and base running , and it s not a criticism necessarily of his work in those two areas , but we just felt that mookie might actually be more valuable to us in some other capacity in the organization , alderson said the two coaches that have the highest profile on the staff dave hudgens , the hitting coach , and dan warthen , the pitching coach will remain unchanged hudgens has another year on his contract warthen , a holdover from the previous administration , impressed alderson and collins with his demeanor and work ethic he has a great relationship with our pitching staff , collins said of warthen i watched him prepare on a daily basis and come up with a plan that , when executed , worked
dr , 71 , a pediatrician and a leader in the field of learning disabilities , died in north carolina a day after a sexual abuse and malpractice suit was filed against him in boston the north carolina medical examiner s office confirmed that dr levine s death at his home in rougemont , nc , had been reported by the orange county sheriff s office on friday , but it said that there would be no statement this weekend on the cause of death dr levine s lawyer , edward mahoney , said he did not have details on the cause or timing of the death this entire episode is a tragedy , mr mahoney said throughout it , dr levine never wavered that his care and treatment of all children was appropriate in all respects , and he steadfastly denied the allegations against him dr levine was a leading advocate for children with learning disabilities , whose fame spread through his books , including a mind at a time his pbs series , national lectures and an appearance on the oprah winfrey show with charles schwab , he founded a nonprofit group , , that has trained thousands of teachers nationwide dr levine s approach emphasized that whatever their learning disabilities or learning differences , as he called them all children had strengths they could build on as well while dr levine had been dogged by complaints of sexual abuse of patients for years , none were proved or widely publicized so it came as a shock in medical and education circles three years ago when a boston lawyer , carmen l durso , filed a lawsuit accusing dr levine of sexually abusing five former patients when they were boys mr durso held a news conference at his office on thursday to announce a new and sexual abuse suit against dr levine , charging him with abusing 40 patients , all boys , while he was a doctor at children s hospital boston , from 1966 to 1985 the lawsuit , filed in suffolk superior court in massachusetts , claimed that dr levine had stroked , massaged and manipulated the genitals of his patients in a manner which was not medically necessary it sought certification as a class action , on behalf of an estimated 5 , 000 boys whom dr levine treated while at the hospital mr durso said saturday that he would make no statement this weekend , out of respect for dr levine s family dr levine was never convicted of any abuse charge , and he never faced criminal charges there were , however , accusations against him in north carolina as well as massachusetts in march 2009 , as the north carolina medical board was investigating such charges ,  dr levine , a rhodes scholar , was chief of ambulatory at children s hospital boston before moving to the university of north carolina he is survived by his wife , bambi
charlotte , nc the daily bruce pearl watch provided more compelling drama than anything else in tennessee s sixth consecutive ncaa tournament appearance and it created an air of finality friday when pearl , the volunteers' coach , who faces accusations that he violated ncaa recruiting rules and who has acknowledged that he lied to investigators , led his team onto the floor to face michigan in its opening game in the west region it might have been the last time pearl wore the orangestriped tie and suspenders that have become his trademark at tennessee the vols surged early , faded and then buckled in the second half as no 8 seed michigan pulled away to a 7545 victory zack novak had 14 points for michigan \( 2113 \) , including three 3pointers when the wolverines blew open a close game with a 192 run to open the second half he was one of five michigan players to score in double figures on the flip side of tennessee s quandary , coach john beilein has the wolverines in the ncaa tournament for the second time in three years and into the round of 32 there , they will face no 1 seed duke , which beat no 16 hampton , 8745 , on friday afternoon the matchup comes days after the former michigan player jalen rose accused duke of recruiting africanamerican players who were uncle toms rose made the comment during a film called the fab five that was shown last sunday michigan faced no controversy on friday , though that was reserved for pearl and tennessee , after athletic director mike hamilton told a knoxville radio station this week that he was not certain that pearl would be back next season that statement made pearl s job security the focus here , and left the vols once again straining to concentrate on basketball amid the uncertainty asked if hamilton s pretournament comments were a distraction to the team , guard melvin goins said i do n't think it had anything to do with us on the court , but of course , it was a distraction off the court but , i mean , as players we have to step up and take the responsibility on the court and we did n't come to play today it did n't appear to have rattled the team early the no 9seeded vols \( 1915 \) built a 2317 lead in the first half as michigan shot 4 of 16 from the field but when the wolverines' shots started to fall , so did tennessee the vols all but folded in the second half , when michigan turned a 3329 lead into a 30point blowout we just did n't play with heart , said the freshman forward tobias harris , who had 19 points in the first half , but none in the second half when michigan outscored tennessee , 4216 michigan came out , made shots , and we just did a terrible job of trying to cover them , and on the offense end we rushed too many shots and , you know , basically just quit the wolverines went ahead , 5231 , just 6 minutes 10 seconds into the second half and tennessee never got closer than 16 again it was hard for pearl to dispute tobias s assessment well , when you get beat , 4216 , in a half of basketball , we did n't play with heart and obviously we were terribly discouraged by the margin , the quality of michigan s play , the poorness of our own play and we did let down , pearl said we unraveled it came at an inopportune time for pearl , who is to face the ncaa committee on infractions in june to plead his case he will also have to plead with hamilton and others at tennessee who might want to erase the memory of this game and mitigate possible penalties by eliminating pearl by the end of the game , pearl was left hanging on by perhaps his last orange thread but he was n't giving up , even after his team did on the court we 've got to go before the committee on infractions in june and it s going to be difficult , pearl said we made mistakes we 're going to try and be accountable for those mistakes my goal and my desire is to be the basketball coach at tennessee next year and for a long time
bob flanigan , a founding member of , the wellscrubbed tightharmony group begun more than 60 years ago , when all of its members really were undergraduates , died on sunday at his home in las vegas he was 84 the cause was congestive heart failure , said dina roth , a manager of the current four freshman founded in 1948 , the group is widely described as the longest continuously performing vocal quartet of its kind in the united states a tenor , mr flanigan was the group s longestserving member and its original lead singer he performed with the freshmen until 1992 besides singing , he played trombone and string bass with the group and afterward was its manager for five years in retirement , he remained involved as a mentor and musical adviser the original freshmen , whose singers all doubled on at least one instrument , enjoyed immense popularity in the 1950s and early '60s though the group was most often called a jazz ensemble , its musical style transcended category , encompassing elements of barbershop , jazz and pop the freshmen s characteristic sound which married harmonies joined as snugly as fine cabinetry with a lush improvisatory style that made the ensemble sound far bigger than it was was a palpable influence on later groups like and  we all think in instrumental terms , mr flanigan told the new york times in 1982 i think of singing lead as i would play it on trombone , sitting in the stan kenton trombone section when we started , all four of us were kenton fans , and everybody who has been in the group since then has been a kenton fan over the years , the four freshmen recorded more than 50 albums and received six grammy nominations now in its 22nd lineup , the group comprises brian eichenberger , curtis calderon , vince johnson and bob ferreira robert lee flanigan was born on aug 22 , 1926 , in greencastle , ind after army service , he enrolled at in indianapolis there he joined a barbershop quartet , originally called hal s harmonizers , that was started by his cousins ross and don barbour before long the group , by then consisting of mr flanigan , the barbour brothers and a classmate , hal kratzsch , had become the four freshmen the quartet performed in malt shops and midwestern lounges , earning fees on the order of 5 a night in the early 1950s , through the influence of a prominent admirer , mr kenton , the freshmen signed with capitol records their first hit single , , was released in 1952 , followed by hits including and  the group s early albums include voices in modern , four freshmen and five trombones , voices in latin and voices in love mr flanigan s first marriage ended in divorce he is survived by his second wife , the former mary scott , whom he married in 1963 two children from his first marriage , stephen flanigan and debbie muria four children from his second marriage , scott flanigan , julie maple , jill flanigan and jennifer turner a sister , maxine thomas 15 grandchildren and five greatgrandchildren also surviving is mr flanigan s cousin ross barbour don barbour died in 1961 , mr kratzsch in 1970 in one respect , the original freshmen were victims of their own success none graduated from college to the consternation of their parents , they left butler to pursue their music once the group took off , they never went back , and it seemed they would remain freshmen forever the condition was partly rectified in 2008 , when butler awarded mr flanigan and ross barbour honorary doctorates
when north carolina finally voted to secede on may 20 , 1861 , editor william holden later wrote , the state s convention looked like a sea partly in storm , partly calm , the secessionists shouting and throwing up their hats and rejoicing , the conservatives sitting quietly , calm , and depressed even as they voted unanimously to leave the union , north carolina s leading politicians could not conceal the conflicts that would divide the state throughout the war only three months before , north carolina voters had beaten back secessionists , refusing even to call a convention and yet on that day in may the convention became the last official body to leave the union , although virginia and tennessee s secessions still awaited popular ratification indeed , the state s change of heart and the evident fault lines at the fraught may convention remind us of three easytooverlook aspects of the upper south s turn to the confederacy for one thing , whites in the upper south had argued about secession for decades , and objections to the right to secede did not disappear with the firing on fort sumter even as the state s politicians bowed to disunion , they disagreed about method in one of the stranger secession stories , north carolina s conservatives paused on the precipice of disunion to beg the convention to consider not secession but revolution , a right that belonged to any people who could defend themselves put forward by george e badger , a former senator and secretary of the navy , a resolution of revolution garnered significant support , but not enough to derail the secessionists seeing failure , conservatives moved to make the secession vote unanimous , but their glum visages betrayed their misgivings arguments about secession in the upper south were not , however , arguments about slavery conservatives and secessionists defended slavery through different methods in north carolina , as in much of the upper south , unionists believed the nation the best , perhaps only , safeguard for slavery on the evening after the vote , hearing secessionists fire a hundredgun salute at the state capitol , badger called the sound the death knell of slavery third , the upper south s late decisions shaped the war to a degree largely forgotten today its secessions wounded the union gravely and gave the confederacy a muchneeded boost of soldiers and territory north carolina residents stocked the confederate army with 125 , 000 men and lost perhaps 35 , 000 , arguably the most of any southern state then , as white unanimity and confederate hopes faded , carolinians deserted at astonishing rates , and a peace movement spread across the state , seriously hindering the southern war effort moreover , slaves in the state gave the lie to any semblance of unanimity as they took their future in their own hands , running to union lines and eventually serving in large numbers in the northern army north carolina illustrated these commitments and divisions because it was simultaneously deeply southern and , in other ways , not quite southern at all slavery stood at the center of north carolina life , but plantations did not slaves made up about onethird of the state s 1 million people , a proportion notably smaller than south carolina s or mississippi s , but slightly larger than tennessee s or virginia s of the roughly onequarter of north carolina families who owned slaves , 70 percent owned fewer than 10 much of the state was full of small to middling farmers 70 percent of farms were smaller than 100 acres there were only two towns of 5 , 000 people , and none had more than 10 , 000 people the state s political divisions arose in part from geography north carolina had long been divided in three sections most slaves lived in a coastal plain of largescale cotton and rice plantations the state s two other regions had smaller but still substantial slave populations a large central piedmont of middling staple and livestock farms , and the high western appalachians westerners tended to fight against eastern planters on key issues like state spending on railroads and increased taxation on slaves eastern planters formed the backbone of early secessionist movements , while most appalachian and particularly piedmont politicians argued for union but if the power of plantations divided the public , the importance of slavery did not across the state , most leading men owned slaves in 1860 , more than 85 percent of the state legislators were slaveholders , the highest percentage in the south even appalachian politicians vigorously supported slave orthodoxy defending slaveowning was a way of protecting not plantations but property if they can take our niggers away from us they can take our cows and hosses , and everything else we ve got ! one western slaveowner warned his neighbors senator thomas clingman , a westerner who owned no slaves , was one of the country s mostvirulent defenders of slavery and secession abraham lincoln s election in november 1860 inspired secessionists in north carolina , like their comrades in the deep south , to push for a quick break as rumors spread of slave uprisings and northern plots , clingman took to the senate floor in washington to warn that north carolina should expect to have slavery abolished by force of arms , and to see the south reduced to the condition of jamaica or st domingo a county meeting called northern actions intolerable and promised to defend any of the slave holding states that shall secede the fervent talk worried westerner sallie lenoir i dread the dark future , she wrote if the south would only keep cool and try him lincoln first i think we need not fear much but i cannot hope that during these winter months , north carolina unionists worked diligently to block the state from joining its deep south neighbors the constitution did not permit secession , former gov william graham argued , and the necessity for revolution does not yet exist along with skepticism over the right of secession , unionists disagreed with the strategy instead of protecting slavery , they argued , secession would destroy the institution holden , the state s leading democrat and newspaperman , urged people to watch and wait secession would end in civil war , in military despotism , and in the destruction of slave property a legislator warned that secession would be bringing canada down to the borders of the south our slaves would only have to step across the line , and they would be free as a compromise , the state legislature called a february referendum on whether to hold a secession convention the campaign was rough and ribald in popular meetings in raleigh , unionist workingmen disrupted a secession meeting by burning tar barrels , ringing bells and shouting down speakers another crowd shot a confederate flag and chopped the flagpole to pieces unionists elsewhere promised , to the tune of dixie , to live and die for union on feb 28 the state voted narrowly by about 650 votes out of about 94 , 000 against a secession convention and unionist strength was greater than those numbers indicate because some people voted both for the convention and for unionist delegates , unionists would have held about 80 of the 120 seats many unionists in fact regretted the convention s defeat had the convention met , it would have been controlled by conservatives a future crisis , they feared , might prompt the election of more radical delegates at the same time , the unionist victory was not as profound as it seemed many north carolinians still hoped in february for an orderly resolution , perhaps from virginia s peace conference when the peace conference collapsed , one unionist glumly warned , there seems to be very little hope now additionally , many unionists calculated their choices pragmatically in times of peace , sticking with the union might be the best way to protect slave property if war broke out , however , most of them had no heart to fight the south and no faith in northern support for protecting slavery in wartime many foresaw that an attack on sumter would lead to a conflict the state could not avoid days before sumter , with his state still in the union , a north carolina west point cadet prepared to leave school as there will be no compromise , and the border states will be compelled to secede however unwilling they may be to do so once lincoln called for troops , secessionist gov john ellis dismissed the government s gross usurpation of power , and the legislature called a may 20 convention and began to prepare for war meanwhile , unionism in the state crumbled congressman zebulon vance , a western unionist , was gesturing to the heavens for peace and the union of our fathers when someone handed him news of lincoln s call for troops when my hand came down , vance recalled later , it fell slowly and sadly by the side of a secessionist i immediately , with altered voice and manner , called upon the assembled multitude to volunteer , not to fight against but for south carolina as the state prepared for its may 20 convention , there was much anxiety but little public debate i tremble for you and for myself , jonathan worth , a state senator , wrote to his son a conservative raised a quaker , worth refused to attend the convention but acceded to its results peaceable secession would soon annihilate slavery war , long continued , will ruin every peaceful citizen and end in the total overthrow of civil liberty and the abolition of slavery i think the south is committing suicide , but my lot is cast with the south the immediate acquiescence to the strategy , if not the principle , of secession shows the deep limitations of southern unionism while some scholars critique lincoln for not appealing to southern unionists , their loyalty was situational lincoln could keep the upper south in the union , or he could defend federal forts from confederate seizure , but he could not do both meanwhile , white and black carolinians watched and waited , some hopeful , some fearful , all unsure of what was to come hannah crasson , a young slave near raleigh , remembered that her master told her father and uncles that a northern victory would mean freedom the master s son , however , bragged dey could eat breakfast at home , go and whup the north , and be back far dinner would the war bring freedom or confederate triumph \? her master s son went away , and it wuz four long years before he cum back to dinner , crasson remembered when he returned , she

this is the matchup you hope for the two top ranked players in the world novak djokovic and rafael nadal facing off for the biggest prize in men s tennis the only bit of bad news of course is that with a 4 pm eastern start time on monday the match will take place when most people are at work still , this is one of those matches that has all the makings of a classic nadal , the defending champion , has made his way through in workmanlike fashion , challenged but never in any real danger through six matches , he lost only one set , and that was to andy murray in the semifinals murray came into the match playing some outstanding tennis , but nadal took the first two sets before murray seemed to even begin to find his way the match was never in doubt , however , and nadal enters this final looking ready to win his second united states open title djokovic again stands in his way , but he is a very different player than he was when they met in last year s final djokovic has had one of those seasons that borders on magical , and has been nearly invincible on hardcourts the one player who beat him on this surface was roger federer , the man he dispatched in a gutty comeback fiveset win in the semifinals in that match , djokovic was down two sets to none before fighting back to push it to five sets federer looked the better player throughout the fifth set , and even held two match points on his serve but djokovic did what champions do , and found a way to win back those points , break federer and somehow snatch away a most improbable victory it has just been that kind of season for djokovic , while nadal has played second fiddle for most of the year save for the french open headtohead this year , it has not been close djokovic has won all five matches , all in finals , on all three surfaces the bottom line is all signs point to a djokovic victory here he is simply on a different level right now although i said the same thing about serena williams , and look what happened there nadal is more than capable of winning , but djokovic only seems likely to lose if he comes into this match flat after the long , emotional battle with federer i don t see that happening , so i m going to call this one for djokovic in four sets but as sam stosur proved on sunday , anything can happen

' he said they concluded that they were not this really is not about guns , he said , referring to the shooting it s about mental illness and a person who had an agenda mr templeton said that none of the roughly 200 exhibitors had canceled , and more than a thousand people had shown up by early saturday items for sale included gun juice , a type of lubricant 40round magazines for ak47s , at 1999 and bumper stickers critical of president obama jerry mercante , an employee of defensive arms and ammo , which has a small store in tucson and a large display of handguns at the show , said he had

still , there were small indications that things were different at the gun show this weekend a box at the exhibit hall s entrance solicited donations for a tragedy in tucson victims fund \( a sign promoting the national rifle association was beside the box \) an american flag flew at halfstaff at 12 15 pm , mr templeton asked the crowed to observe a moment of silence and asked for reflection on

in the mental health field people kill people in his weekly address on saturday , president obama spoke about the shootings and urged members of congress to work together as they returned to washington he recalled that in the days right after the attack , one of the places we saw that sense of community on display was on the floor of congress one by one , representatives from all parts of the country and all points of view rose in common cause to honor gabby and the other victims and to reflect on our shared hopes for this country , the president said as shrill and discordant as our politics can be at times , it was a moment that reminded us of who we really are and how much we depend on one another senator john mccain , republican of arizona , in an article on the washington post s oped page on sunday , praised the president for the speech he delivered on wednesday at a memorial service in tucson i disagree with many of the president s policies , but i believe he is a patriot sincerely intent on using his time in office to advance our country s cause , mr mccain wrote i reject accusations that his policies and beliefs make him unworthy to lead america or opposed to its founding ideals and i reject accusations that americans who vigorously oppose his policies are less intelligent , compassionate or just than those who support them our political discourse should be more civil than it currently is , and we all , myself included , bear some responsibility for it not being so , mr mccain said it probably asks too much of human nature to expect any of us to be restrained at all times by persistent modesty and empathy from committing rhetorical excesses that exaggerate our differences and ignore our similarities but i do not think it is beyond our ability and virtue to refrain from substituting character assassination for spirited and respectful debate the safeway , in a shopping center at the corner of ina road and oracle road in northern tucson , reopened at 7 am on saturday , two days after company officials said the fbi gave it control of the building again employees had spent the time since then restocking shelves and trying to make the

elliott carter completed his concerto for flute and ensemble in march 2008 , back when he was only 99 the astonishingly prolific mr carter is about 10 weeks shy of 103 since , he has written 14 works he was at alice tully hall on wednesday night , when the flutist and the mannes orchestra , conducted by , gave the new york premiere of his rhapsodic and brilliant 14minute concerto you can only imagine what it meant to ms spencer and the gifted student players from to perform the work in mr carter s presence for this free program mr hayes also conducted a lively , cleartextured account of haydn s symphony no 96 in d \( miracle \) and drew a slightly scrappy but vigorous and affecting performance of schubert s long , demanding symphony no 9 in c mr carter s concerto had its premiere in jerusalem by the flutist emmanuel pahud and the jerusalem international chamber music ensemble , conducted by daniel barenboim in 2008 james levine gave the american premiere in 2010 with the boston symphony orchestra mr carter s composer s note for the piece reads almost like a mea culpa for not having written a flute concerto earlier i kept putting it off , because i felt that the flute could not produce the sharp attacks that i use so frequently , he writes but the idea of the beautiful qualities of the different registers of the instrument and the extraordinary agility attracted me more and more the work , scored for an ensemble including piano and percussion , was performed here by 22 players it opens with startling , crisp orchestral chords that prod the flute into scurrying figures , quickly taken up by other instruments the flute s skittish riffs and winding lyrical lines sometimes ignite agitated orchestral responses at other times they are cushioned by subdued , sustained harmonies even when the music breaks into a jumpy backandforth , the mood is industrious , not aggressive mr carter s language has lost none of its piercing , atonal bite yet like most of his works from his 90s and later , this score is less densely complex and layered than those from earlier decades the enhanced clarity is a welcome turn , making it easier to hear mr carter s scintillating sonorities , myriad instrumental colors and complex rhythmic interplay about midway through the concerto , as the orchestra remains quite feisty , the flute , as if in its own zone , just keeps playing steady , pensive passages eventually the flute prevails , and the piece turns ruminative but not for long an extended , scherzolike section full of fantastical flights takes off and builds to a final flourish of everywhichway spiraling figures ms spencer s impressive performance had all the beautiful qualities and extraordinary agility mr carter could have asked for the young players under mr hayes seemed engrossed by the music and in command of it mr carter stood up from his seat , a little shakily , to salute the players and acknowledge the ovation
to the editor  , by jeffrey rosen \( week in review , jan 9 \) , about constitutional originalism , illuminates many of the difficulties inherent in the doctrine , but he does not mention a powerful objection to its fundamental principle if one had asked the founders , should a judge 200 years hence determine the meaning of a constitutional provision by relying upon opinions of men two centuries dead not because those opinions are reasonable or wise , but only because they have become traditional \? , i think the founders' reply would be obvious to surrender one s independent judgment to traditional authority is to ignore the essence of the enlightenment , which demands of us that we think for ourselves douglas o'keefe san francisco , jan 10 , 2011  to the editor constitutional originalism is all the rage these days , jeffrey rosen wrote , but the rage is about posture , not originalism selfstyled originalist justices loudly champion states' rights , but blatantly intruded into florida s elections in bush v gore \( 2000 \) nowhere does the constitution mention corporations as persons having the same rights as individuals , yet the court happily ignored this in citizens united v federal election commission \( 2010 \) the constitution provides congress and not the president with the right to declare war furthermore , by virtue of article vi , the united nations charter is part of the supreme law of the land it forbids intervention in the affairs of other countries we have continually violated both without a whimper of protest from our originalists but none of this matters to rightist supreme court justices like antonin scalia , because they are ideologues committed to the primacy of wealth and power they invoke the respectable mantle of originalism , while not really giving a hoot for the original constitution roger carasso los angeles , jan 9 , 2011  to the editor antonin scalia s originalist reading of the constitution is based more upon historical fiction than true history it is a subjective , not objective , interpretation most recently in citizens united , justice scalia joined the court s 8to1 ruling upholding disclosure requirements in the statute at issue at the time of the constitution there were a few select corporations that were under the thumb of the legislatures now the corporations control the legislatures and congress through financing of election campaigns and media ads daniel g deneen bloomington , ill , jan 9 , 2011  to the editor justice william brennan pointed out that trying to find legitimacy in fidelity to the intentions of the framers was little more than arrogance cloaked as humility it is arrogant , justice brennan said , to pretend that from our vantage we can gauge accurately the intent of the framers on application of principle to specific , contemporary questions for justice brennan , the constitution had no static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone , but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs stephen rohde los angeles , jan 9 , 2011  to the editor jeffrey rosen s observations on the ambiguities of originalism , coming a few days after the public reading of the constitution in congress , should remind us that the issue is not reading the text , which we all love , but what we read into it that originalism has different meanings and conclusions highlights the universal fallacy to speak of the constitution there is , as a practical matter , no constitution there are only interpretations of the constitution these may broadly be described as conservative \( or strict \) and liberal \( or loose \) one can prove a particular document to adhere to one or the other interpretation , but one cannot prove either interpretation to be correct like vanilla and chocolate , a fondness for a conservative or a liberal reading is a matter of taste , not logic or evidence manfred weidhorn fair lawn , nj , jan 9 , 2011  to the editor it is comforting to know that justice antonin scalia has the good sense to refrain from following his originalist beliefs to their logical conclusion \( a fainthearted originalist \) and stops short of following justice clarence thomas over the cliff into an absolutist and dogmatic straitjacket a few days ago , the house of representatives , spurred on by tea party fervor , treated us to a sanitized reading of our constitution using a slippery argument to avoid embarrassing mentions of male voters and threefifths of a person they , too , were avoiding the troublesome implications of their ideology steven berkowitz new york , jan 9 , 2011
if we could bottle a few days to uncork later in the year when the wind has got us by the neck and the curbs are full of taxislush these would be the ones early june , the days of peony and iris conifers still wear the green tips of new growth , and a few of the hardwoods , hickories especially , still show a last vestige of may otherwise , the trees have cast their pollen and fledged completely now come the deep , dark shadows of late summer in the city , the pigeons have passed the stage of courtship and settled into a beaktobeak domesticity full of gratified cooing the subway platforms are still temperate in the country , the cool , dry nights are completely silent , none of august s nightrasp at twilight , the swallows go off watch , and on come the bats in the dimness you can still make out bumblebees flying bottomheavy from blossom to blossom the fireflies have not yet lit up best of all , the day is still growing in length , the solstice still a couple of weeks away this is the particular poignancy of june so much has gone by already fruit blossoms , daffodils , tulips and lilacs and yet everything feels so young , even as we come to the turning point in the calendar of light , the moment when the year starts waning again it feels absurdly unsynchronized , and yet it is synchronicity itself it would be nice to decant some early june whenever you needed to , when the sun has n't shone in days , when the temperature reaches triple digits , whenever the weather or anything else gets you down but all we can do is drink in june while the month is upon us , while the peonies are coming into bloom
louisville , ky he is the son of a brazilianbred stallion and a germanbred mare he is owned by a syndicate of 20 partners led by a sometimes ebullient , often cranky former turf writer he is trained by an englishman who has never been cited for violating a medication rule and believes a horse should be allowed to be a horse as much as possible no , animal kingdom is not your typical  still , animal kingdom , a son of , proved he was the best horse in the field saturday , rolling down the stretch here like a wave to score an emphatic twoandthreequarterlength victory animal kingdom did this on a dry track , earning respectable speed figures none of his rivals can claim to have been compromised by a bad trip so this colt is on to the , where his trainer , graham motion , and barry irwin , the chief executive of team valor international , can continue to demonstrate how solid horsemanship rather than black bag veterinarian work can succeed at horse racing s highest level this is especially important now that representative edward whitfield , republican of kentucky , and senator tom udall , democrat of new mexico , introduced legislation last week to regulate the use of performanceenhancing drugs and medications in horse racing major industry stakeholders have acknowledged that medication rules in the united states are out of step with europe , hong kong and australia , where horse racing thrives , and that it is time for a significant overhaul of the sport how animal kingdom was bred by irwin and how he was managed by motion are nothing short of remarkable in this day and age leroidesanimaux is an inexpensive sire with a turf pedigree , and his dam , the german mare , had never run on the dirt in fact , animal kingdom had never raced on the dirt before the derby we have not done enough importing of horses and blood lines from other places where horses do n't run on drugs , and horses' legs are not manipulated , and horses , basically , are bigger and tougher , stronger and sounder , said irwin , 68 , who has bought and bred horses from europe and south africa in germany , you are not allowed to breed a mare that has ever raced on drugs , lasix , bute , nothing so when you buy some stock from there , you know you 're getting something good in motion , irwin has found a kindred spirit the trainer came to the united states 30 years ago but adheres to european principles of horsemanship his base is a europeanstyled training center in maryland , where his stock hacks , or gallops , on wooded trails or runs in pastures and is turned out in paddocks last year , he was one of two trainers on the top 20 earnings list without a medication violation after 25 years of using multiple trainers , irwin says he was exasperated by the lack of truth telling in the profession i do n't want to have 18 trainers , he said i do n't want to hear stories from 17 trainers every day unless you 're there and you have one guy on your team that s on your side , you 're not going to get the truth and i reached the point where i was fed up with it i also wanted to have my horses trained offsite from the racetrack , because racetrack life for a horse is n't any good we have had horses with graham for the last three years , he said i asked him early last year if he would train horses for us on a private basis he did n't want to do it so we waited about six , seven months , after he had a little more chance to work with me , and i asked him again , and he decided to do it , and then we decided to go that way motion , too , recognized animal kingdom s sturdiness and saw the possibilities for the colt beyond racing on grass i think some of the good horses in the past , some of the best horses , were ones who were able to handle both , motion said he appears to be one of those great horses that can handle both maybe he is better on the grass , but he s also a horse that can handle the dirt brilliant horses can do that how brilliant is animal kingdom \? we 'll know more in two weeks at pimlico race course when he contests the preakness , the second leg of the it appears that the derby s thirdplace finisher , mucho macho man , and the beaten favorite , dialed in , are also definite for baltimore the runnerup , nehro , and midnight interlude are possible pimlico officials say there is a long line of new faces that could provide a full field of 14 but for now , let s appreciate animal kingdom s derby victory for how it was attained with the best interest of the horse and the sport in mind

the first x factor results show got rid of an act that needed to go , but man what a slog getting to that morsel of drama the show , thursday night , was a full hour even though it had only one item of business to eliminate one of the 12 acts , drawing on audience voting from the previous night s show the format , as the insufferably bland host , steve jones , informed us at the start , was simple the top 10 votegetters would advance automatically , and the bottom 2 would square off in a onesongeach singoff , with the winner determined by the x factor judges why did this take an hour \? well , for one thing , the show , which began at 8 eastern , first had to serve up highlights of the wednesday night show that took till 8 18 then came a shameless bit of hucksterism in which the finalists gushed about how thrilled they would be to appear in a pepsi commercial , which is part of the top prize that led inexorably to a performance by outasight , the singer who currently hawks pepsi , the show s main sponsor it s time to get serious , mr jones finally said at 8 23 after outasight was done getting serious , it turned out , meant breaking for four minutes of commercials upon returning , mr jones reported breathlessly , we re moments away from the results ! but first , the producers felt we needed to hear all 12 acts spout cliches indicating that surprise none of them wanted to be eliminated i m not here to go home , chris rene said earnestly our dreams are at stake , said someone from the group intensity this is my last shot in my life , said stacy francis puhleese finally mr jones coughed up the only information anyone had tuned in to hear the bottom two were intensity and , somewhat surprisingly , the stereo hogzz that provided a small bit of drama because both were mentored by the same judge , paula abdul , so she d be forced to cast a vote against one of her own the stereo hogzz sang emotion , and not very well fortunately for the hogzz , intensity was far worse on my life would suck without you , perhaps the worsttitled song of the last decade ms abdul , nicole scherzinger and la reid all voted , rightly , to send intensity home \( simon cowell , inexplicably , wanted to boot the hogzz \) no one will miss these forgettable teenypoppers the x factor , incidentally , was renewed for a second season this week leading to a discussion question which of the current four judges should be replaced , and by whom \? mr cowell , of course , has immunity , since it s his show but let s pretend he doesn t

feb 39 , 1861 one could not help feeling if not awestruck then at least properly respectful at the gathering of political nobility assembled last week at willard s hotel six former cabinet members , 19 exgovernors , 14 former senators , 50 former representatives and a dozen state supreme court judges it was dramatic to see so many giants of the past john wright , who sat in congress in the 20s and is now nearly blind , and thomas ewing , who had sat in the cabinet of zachary taylor , and david wilmot , the architect of the wilmot proviso , and james clay , son of the great compromiser himself , and old general wool , who was even older than winfield scott , and so many more rousing themselves from the comforts of home and hearth and enduring a winter s journey to once more offer service to their beloved country at their head was the venerable john tyler , the former president , who had become dismayed at the sight of the senate allowing senator crittenden s compromise to slip though its fingers , and who , as a private citizen , had lobbied his state of virginia to call this meeting to perhaps save the country from the path of destruction it seemed hellbent on following frankly , the heart beat a little faster to see these silverhaired gentlemen answer patriotism s call the warm feelings , alas , did not long endure these are , after all , men whose failure when they were in their prime to do more than patch over the question of slavery has resulted in a bill that has at long last come due , and the thought that their stooped shoulders was covered in a mantle of wisdom proved as evanescent as a summer morning s dew it has not taken long to be reminded that the 70yearold president tyler has always been far more admired for his animal spirits he has a comely wife three decades his junior who has just borne him his 15th child than he is respected for his political acumen \( remember , he is the only president who lost his entire cabinet to resignation and who alienated congressional leaders by vetoing a banking bill for the second time after congress had accommodated all the objections he raised the first time around and who is the first president to have had impeachment charges against him considered \) the greater burden that this conference must carry , however , is that not enough people wish it well none of the states that have seceded , for example , have sent delegates , nor has arkansas , nor have the pacific coast states republican bedrock states like michigan and wisconsin are underrepresented , and the delegates who are attending are acting as henchmen , ready to strangle in the crib any compromises that show any potential for success send stiffbacked men to the conference , senator zachariah chandler of michigan told his governor , adding , without a little bloodletting , this union will not , in my opinion , be worth a rush summoned to transcend the intransigence of congress , the delegates are duplicating it albeit in an entirely extraconstitutional way , since there is no article that provides , in the event of inaction by congress , for a convocation of grandfathers to take over the arena still , they will continue to meet the fire is warm at willard s , and the spirits are plentiful , and there is nothing ahead for most of these men except another long and bumpy carriage ride and the resumption of irrelevancy and of course there is some wan hope that they may locate a solution should you be visiting washington this month , drop by the willard there is no finer exhibition of political fossils , as horace greeley has dubbed them , in the land one augury that the peace convention is not and perhaps never has been destined for success is that on the same day that president tyler was taking up the gavel as chairman , his 18yearold granddaughter , letitia , was at the state capitol in montgomery , ala , hoisting the flag over the first meeting of a convention of the southern states , who had come together to explore forming a government the idea had arisen in the mind of the south carolina ultra robert rhett , who in late december invited representatives of all of the slaveholding states to montgomery to discuss forming a southern confederacy \( apparently the idea that south carolina would take its place among the world s nations as an independent palmetto republic was never the first choice \) by last week , 37 representatives from six of the seven seceded states \( absent texas , still awaiting the outcome of a statewide ratifying vote \) assembled in mississippi one observer , the wife of a delegate , was no more impressed by the assemblage than horace greeley was with the peace conventioneers in washington whenever there is an election they hunt up some old fossil ages ago laid on the shelf , she confided there never was such a resurrection of the dead and forgotten but where she saw a tired political establishment , others saw many of the region s most talented and experienced leaders alexander stephens , howell cobb and his brother thomas , robert toombs and robert rhett included under the direction of howell cobb , the convention moved with alacrity , after a handful of unusually productive sessions , had adopted a provisional constitution for what it was calling the confederate states of america of course , the document wasn t an entirely original composition , but was heavily based on the constitution of the country they were shedding there are a few key departures the document places a greater emphasis on states rights , enacts a few reforms including limiting the president to a single sixyear term , permits a tariff for building revenue but not for protection \( and does not describe how one can tell the difference \) and establishes an emphatic , unambiguous guarantee of the right to own , transport and retrieve slaves even taking into account that they were working from a template , the delegates decisiveness was impressive also impressive was what they left out of the new constitution the reinstitution of the african slave trade , something that had been an objective of the ultras for years clearly this was a concession to virginia and the states of the upper south , which are more widely split on the subject of disunion so repelled by extremists both north and south that many moderates in the middle of the country have begun thinking that if a split is inevitable , they ought to form a third union of states , encompassing the slaveholding states of the upper south plus pennsylvania , a midatlantic federation held together by similar economic interests and values this was an alarming possibility to the ultras , for it would jeopardize the longterm prospects of the cotton belt federation , and all but end the dream of building a slaveholding empire that would dominate the gulf of mexico and the caribbean and so the convention underscored its moderate intentions it chose jefferson davis and alexander stephens to be president and vice president of the new confederacy not yancey , nor rhett , nor the brilliant but bibulous toombs , nor either of the cobb brothers , nor any of the fireeaters who had midwifed this moment , but davis , the war hero who is admired for his intellect and his civility in the senate and especially for the skill he demonstrated as secretary of war , and stephens , the man who only one month ago was eloquently maintaining that georgia should remain in the union calmly and reasonably , the selections seek to reassure the people of the upper south you see \? we understand you we are protecting the traditions we share we are securing our way of life and so in the excelsior hotel of montgomery , they are dreaming of empire in the willard hotel in washington , they are dreaming of peace and elsewhere in washington , senator william seward , the future secretary of state , is dreaming of war not a civil war against the south , but a war against somebody else almost anyone else reportedly , rudolf schleiden , the minister from bremen , has sent home dispatches that quote or paraphrase seward as saying , if the lord would only give the united states an excuse for a war with england , france , or spain , that would be the best means of reestablishing internal peace schleiden has seward saying that nothing would please him more than if a european power interfered on behalf of south carolina , for then he could pitch into the european power , and south carolina and the seceding states would soon join him in doing so schleiden s report reads quite similarly to a message recently sent to london by the british minister in washington , lord lyons , who said that after talking with seward on a number of occasions , he thought it likely that seward would start taking antibritish stands to shift the public s attention to a foreign threat lyons s interpretation seems to be confirmed by the duke of newcastle , who says that seward told him , if i am to be secretary of state , it will become my duty to insult england , and i mean to do so the duke had little choice but to interpret this comment as a threat , but thurlow weed , seward s protector and champion , assured the duke that the senator was merely offering a pleasantry none of these comments are too different from remarks seward made at a dinner of the new england society last december i am very sure that if anybody was to make a descent upon new york tomorrow , he said to great applause , whether louis napoleon , or the prince of wales , or his mother , or the emperor of russia or austria , i believe all the hills of south carolina would pour forth their population to the rescue of new york , and i do know that if any one of these powers were to make a descent upon charleston and south carolina , i know who would go to their rescue as the dying king tells the young prince harry in henry iv , part 2 , be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels no doubt mr seward knows his shakespeare sources to learn more about these events , please see the battle cry of freedom , by james mcpherson \( oxford university press ,

sean forman is the creator of baseballreferencecom , an online baseball encyclopedia of players , teams and box scores in the major and minor leagues yankees shortstop derek jeter is struggling through what is easily the worst hitting stretch of his career for the 100 games from june 21 of last year to april 13 of this year , jeter has hit 257 with just a 662 ops sabermetricians often combine a player s onbase percentage and slugging percentage as a quick proxy for batting performance this is well below the current american league average of 712 for all batters and 691 for shortstops before his current slump , dating to may 2010 , the worst ops of his career over 100 games was 699 from july 24 , 2003 , to may 25 , 2004 , which he rebounded from with an 823 ops in 2004 given jeter s age \( he will turn 37 in june \) and the severity of his slump , what are the prospects that he can pull out of it \? from 1947 to 2011 there have been 28 middle infielders , including jeter , with careers similar to his with aboveaverage ops s and at least 5 , 000 plate appearances before their age 37 season this group ranges in ability from the lighthitting tony fernandez and bobby avila to the stronghitting barry larkin and joe morgan even in this group , jeter stands out he leads these star middle infielders in hits and batting average , trails only cal ripken jr in plate appearances , jeff kent in ops , and , if you include the postseason , has a wide lead in total games played at shortstop but what does this group do on the other side of 36 \? middle infielders as a group take far more abuse while in the field than outfielders or corner infielders , and as a result tend to age more quickly for example , roberto alomar , whose numbers bear a strong resemblance to jeter s , had his last good season at age 33 and was out of baseball at age 37 from our previous group of 26 star middle infielders \( excluding the currently active jeter and miguel tejada \) , only 14 even played past age 36 , averaging three seasons among them several did play well at 37 or older lou whitaker , davey lopes , kent , morgan and fernandez all had multiple years when they hit better than the league average at age 38 and playing third base , ripken had a 952 ops in 86 games but none of these top hitters were playing shortstop full time only three fulltime shortstops of the 26 played and stayed at shortstop past 36 larkin , alan trammell and pee wee reese jeter s career arc has interestingly and probably coincidentally matched reese s and trammell s an average year at age 34 , a superlative year at age 35 , and back to or below average at 36 the results would be dire if jeter continued to match their careers at age 37 , trammell continued to struggle with a 695 ops and finally retired in 1996 after posting a 526 ops in 66 games reese was worse , with a 667 at age 37 and a 555 at age 38 in 103 games larkin is perhaps the bestcase scenario from ages 37 to 40 , he averaged 93 games and a 719 ops larkin s usage may point the way for the yankees he was injured for two of the four seasons and played in only 45 , 145 , 70 and 111 games he had a nearly leagueaverage 771 ops at age 40 playing in 111 games as a parttime starter the yankees may have taken jeter s durability for granted jeter is one of four players , along with brooks robinson , bobby abreu and pete rose , to play in 150 games in every season from age 30 to 36 , and so far he has played all but two innings of the 2011 season jeter may defy expectations and bounce back to be the besthitting shortstop in the american league it would be unprecedented , but jeter has outlasted his competition and critics in the sabermetric community already at the very least , the yankees may want to find a shortstop who can spell jeter for 30 to 40 games a season to make that rosy outcome more likely this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print chart the jeter slide a look at derek jeter s onbase percentage plus slugging percentage \( ops \) throughout his career each ops is based on his 100 previous games \( source baseballreferencecom \)
sean forman is the creator of baseballreferencecom , an online baseball encyclopedia of players , teams and box scores in the major and minor leagues sabermetrics is largely about measuring what leads to winning on the baseball field naturally , this first leads to studying the parts of the game that have a big impact on any outcome , batting and pitching and if you asked front offices and leading sabermetricians who the best pitchers and hitters are , they would probably name many of the same players but if you asked them to rank the top base runners , their lists would likely diverge some runners are cautious and rarely make an out on the bases , while others try to take the extra base at every opportunity , and sometimes pay the price some are able to read balls in the dirt exceptionally well and advance routinely on wild pitches and passed balls others can t players who steal a lot of bases would most likely top the list , but a single caughtstealing can cancel out the added value of two to three successful attempts , meaning some active base runners would actually be more valuable if they stayed put studying baseball over the course of multiple seasons has led us to believe that each extra base a runner adds , whether by stolen base or otherwise , creates on average 02 runs above what would have been scored otherwise for example , we would expect a team with 200 stolen bases to score 40 more runs than if they had stolen none this may seem small , but remember that many runners who advanced themselves into scoring position may have scored anyway later in an inning or could have ended up stranded on the flip side , a player who is thrown out on the bases costs his team 05 runs below what would have been scored otherwise for example , in 2010 , brett gardner stole 47 bases against 9 unsuccessful attempts , adding about five runs \( 47 x 02 minus 9 x 05 \) to the yankees bottom line this year , he is 17 of 27 stealing bases , so he has subtracted nearly two runs from the yankees season total the use of playbyplay data stretching back to the 1950s , thanks to the work of retrosheet volunteers , means we can now quantify the value of other baserunning events , such as the number of times a runner goes from first to third on a hit , is thrown out trying to take an extra base or advances on defensive indifference or a passed ball a method created by sean smith of baseballprojectioncom tracks the value of these assorted baserunning events by computing the rate in which the major leagues as a whole accumulates plays of each type when compared to this league average , each major leaguers additional outs and bases is computed , leading to the number of additional runs he scored or failed to score once this accounting is completed , the best base runner in baseball can be identified since 2009 , by far , it is michael bourn in that time , he stole 147 bases and was caught 26 times when compared with the major league average , he has added 137 bases versus 10 additional outs , good for adding 23 runs for the astros well behind bourn in second is chase utley with 14 runs added , on an added 43 bases and 11 fewer outs when compared to the average on the flip side , prince fielder is the worst with a minus15 runs on the basepaths fielder is 3 of 6 stealing bases since 2009 , but costs his team runs with his inability to take the extra base he has 107 fewer base advances than the average player fielder has advanced to third on a single just seven times in 133 opportunities behind fielder are three players with minus9 runs billy butler , brian mccann and jason kubel if we expand our search to 1950 , we find a career top five of rickey henderson \( 147 runs \) , tim raines \( 116 \) , willie wilson \( 116 \) , luis aparicio \( 87 \) and davey lopes \( 81 \) the worst ever , not surprisingly , is dominated by catchers , with jorge posada \( 32 runs \) and bob boone \( 31 \) leading the way base running occurs largely at the margins of the modern game while top flight baserunning skills can add as much as a win to a team s bottom line , they are less important than hitting and pitching , and as a result have always been valued less by major league teams for instance , the speedster vince coleman , among the top five base runners since 1985 , made 16 million in his career while his contemporary , cecil fielder , a power hitter and one of the worst base runners of recent times , earned 47 million
tripoli , libya many of the local militia leaders who helped topple col are abandoning a pledge to give up their weapons and now say they intend to preserve their autonomy and influence political decisions as guardians of the revolution the issue of the militias is one of the most urgent facing libya s new provisional government , the transitional national council scores of freewheeling brigades of armed volunteers sprang up around the country and often reported to local military councils , which became de facto local governments in cities like misurata and zintan , as well as the capital , tripoli the provisional government s departing prime minister , , suggested in a news conference sunday night that instead of expecting the local militias to disband , the transitional national council should try to incorporate them by expanding to include their representatives nobody wants to give up arms now , and many tribes and cities are accumulating arms just in case , ' said mahmoud shammam , a spokesman for the council s executive board noting reports of sporadic clashes between militias as well as vigilante revenge killings , many civilian leaders , along with some fighters , say the militias' shift from merely dragging their feet about surrendering weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role poses a stark challenge to the council s fragile authority this could lead to a mess , to conflict between the councils , said ramadan zarmoh , 63 , a leader of the misurata military council , who argued that the city s militia should dissolve itself almost immediately after a new defense ministry is formed if we want to have democracy , we ca n't have this his view , however , appears to be in the minority many members of military councils insist that they need to stay armed until a new constitution is ratified because they do not trust the weak provisional government to steer libya to democracy on its own we are the ones who are holding the power there the people with the force on the ground and we are not going to give that up until we have a legitimate government that will emerge from free and fair elections , said anwar fekini , a frenchlibyan lawyer who is a leader of the armed groups in the western mountains and is also close to top leaders of the transitional council we will make sure we are going to bring the country to a civil constitution and democratic system , he added , and we will use all available means first of all our might on the ground militia leaders have already demonstrated their resolve to step into the political process before the provisional government named a new prime minister monday night , local leaders in misurata speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid an open fight with the national council threatened that if it failed to agree on a candidate they deemed satisfactory , local military councils from cities in western libya might intercede to decide the question the choice for prime minister , abdel rahim elkeeb , a tripoli engineer and businessman , pleased the western cities and resolved the matter peacefully but officials of the national council say the threat of intervention itself undermines the transition to civilian democracy , in which disputes are settled with ballots or gavels , not with weapons mr shammam said that armed intervention would be a disaster and that adopting a new constitution should happen under the umbrella of the law police stations , judges rather than military councils and the force of arms he and others in the national council say they hope that as their next transitional government takes over and begins to build a national army , a goal that has so far remained elusive , local military councils will begin to stand down referring to the promised election of a governing body this year , he added , if the military councils start to extend and expand themselves , they will be a replacement for a national assembly some point to neighboring egypt , where the council of military officers that took power at the ouster of president hosni mubarak has delayed a transition to civilian control others say there is a danger libya could resemble the chaos in yemen or syria because there are several autonomous militias poised to take on a political role in tripoli , in the western mountain towns like zintan and its neighbors , in misurata , and in the eastern city of benghazi in the east and in tripoli , some of the largest , bestequipped brigades are associated with islamist groups now forming political parties they will keep their arms as long as they are not part of the power , mr shammam , who is a liberal , predicted there have already been clashes between armed groups two weeks ago , fighters from zintan and misurata fought briefly at the tripoli international airport , leaving about three dead , said abed rzag albakesh , 40 , a military leader from zintan he said provocations by a qaddafi loyalist in disguise were to blame last week , a shootout erupted between two groups in the capital s central martyrs square , which the local military council has now banned other fighters from entering after the conquest last month of colonel qaddafi s last holdout , in surt , fighters from misurata and benghazi clashed briefly over looting , mr zarmoh , the misurata commander , said , though he said none were injured and early monday morning , a group of zintan fighters attacked a tripoli hospital , searching , they said , for a qaddafi loyalist seeking treatment inside , according to reports on tripoli radio the ntc appears to be helpless , abdurrahman k shater , a respected columnist in one of the dozens of new newspapers , the nation , said of the transitional council , like a deceived husband who does not know what s going on behind his back , or who knows but goes along the transitional national council has pledged in a constitutional declaration that within eight months after the selection of a new government , it will hold elections for a national assembly , which will oversee the writing of a constitution \( mr jibril , in his news conference , appeared to suggest casting the declaration aside without much fuss , raising questions about how binding it is \) with no history of electoral democracy , libya s provisional authorities must draw electoral districts and devise a voting system decisions with inevitable winners and losers , politically and geographically during the uprising , officials of the transitional national council vowed to give equal voice to all libyans , regardless of their location or political position but leaders in misurata , a commercial center that withstood a long siege to emerge as the arsenal of libyan revolt , say they are advocating a fourpoint set of criteria for representation that would increase their say , at the expense of smaller towns or those who stayed loyal to colonel qaddafi population , size , economic output and priority in liberation some in the eastern areas around benghazi , neglected under colonel qaddafi in favor of the west , are now arguing for libya to return to a loose federal structure that could protect them from domination by tripoli and misurata but azza kamel maghur , a human rights lawyer who recently held a conference in misurata to talk about the transition process , said she was particularly surprised by the open determination to introduce weapons to the political process they stood up and said , we are not going to give up our arms until the constitution is drafted , ' she said you cannot have a civil democratic society with weapons how can you make elections \?
st louis commissioner and a handful of the most influential owners concluded meetings with demaurice smith , the head of the nowdecertified players association , and a group of players thursday afternoon in chicago amid indications that for the first time since march , progress could be made on a deal that would end the labor strife that has brought the league to a halt after the meetings , which began in secret tuesday night and stretched into thursday afternoon , concluded , chief magistrate judge arthur boylan , who had been overseeing mediated negotiations , announced that two days of mediation scheduled for next week had been canceled the two sides , though , are prepared to continue talking , probably at an undisclosed location next week boylan will almost certainly be present , although he may not be actively running the negotiations toward a settlement boylan was present for the meetings in chicago , which the nfl initiated by placing the first phone call to mr smith none of the lawyers who have been involved in early negotiations were present , one of the conditions of the meetings and none are expected to attend when the sides resume talking next week that should please both sides the players , who were frustrated by the lack of direct negotiations with owners during earlier sessions , and the owners , who thought that the lawyers for the players were more interested in going to court than in negotiating an agreement it went well , said one person who was present at the meetings but who spoke on condition of anonymity because the court wanted the particulars of the meetings to remain confidential still , others briefed on the meetings urged caution and said a completed deal was , at best , several weeks away even if negotiations went smoothly the nfl s goal is to have a deal done by late june or early july , because that would allow several weeks of free agency before training camps open at the end of july and the preseason begins the nfl and the decertified players association issued a joint statement confirming the talks , but provided no further details the driving force behind the meetings , which were held so close to the vest that some owners were not even aware they were taking place , was the calendar with the eighth circuit court of appeals hearing arguments friday in the league s appeal of the injunction that ordered an end to the owners' lockout of players , the leverage has not yet fully swung to one side the owners may have the upper hand because a delay has kept the lockout in place , and the court indicated it is likely to reverse the injunction
newt gingrich may have the union leader of new hampshire , but on friday , mitt romney landed his own highprofile media endorsement ramesh ponnuru , a senior editor at national review in an essay unambiguously titled romney s the one scheduled to appear in the dec 19 issue of the conservative magazine , mr ponnuru argues that mr romney is the right candidate to earn his party s nomination republicans should not be gloomy about this prospect , mr ponnuru writes romney is n't merely the candidate who is likely to win the republican primaries he s the candidate who should win them that s why he s likely to win mr ponnuru s support is also an indicator that there are still some conservatives who are moving to coalesce around mr romney as the candidate who can beat president obama next november that does n't mean mr romney is without flaws , mr ponnuru says , acknowledging his health care plan in massachusetts was obamacare in one state he s a flipflopper inauthentic but he also points out that while concerns linger about mr romney s conservative credentials , he was to the right of senator john mccain of arizona when they both ran for president in 2008 , and he is also to the right of president george w bush and , mr ponnuru argues , mr romney emerges from a republican party that now features a remarkable degree of programmatic consensus the narrowness of the candidates' differences on pertinent issues militates in favor of picking the one who can best implement the sensible agenda they largely share , he writes it also reduces conservatives' need to worry about candidates' sincerity if president romney were to do an aboutface on carbon caps , the right to life , or taxes , he would be going to war with the vast majority of his party the current surge for mr gingrich , mr ponnuru predicts , is his party s latest flirtation with yet another flavorofthemonth alternative to mr romney , but that once it settles down , mr romney will most likely be the nominee and that s not a bad thing the right thing for republican voters to do now is to make romney undergo the rigors of a competitive primary and then grant him the nomination , mr ponnuru concludes my bet is that s exactly what they 're going to do of course , not everyone is convinced on the same day that mr ponnuru s essay hit national review s web site , the site also published an essay by the conservative columnist charles krauthammer , titled , mitt vs newt republicans must choose between two significantly flawed frontrunners after breaking down what he sees as both mr gingrich s and mr romney s flaws , mr krauthammer comes to the grim conclusion that you play the hand you 're dealt my own view is that republicans would have been better served by the candidacies of mitch daniels , paul ryan or chris christie , he writes unfortunately , none is running republicans , mr krauthammer concludes , must consider two questions who is more likely to prevent that second term \? and who , if elected , is less likely to unpleasantly surprise \? this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

keflezighi said on friday , referring to the final two miles of the race , where he knows how each stride counts keflezighi became the first american to win the 2009 race since alberto salazar did in

robbins keitany s time as she hits first avenue will tell a lot about her race her previous two miles were her slowest of the race , but the stretch over the queensboro bridge is one of the bigger uphill stretches of the course , so her time as she hits manhattan will show if she is slowing down , or simply battling the hills lz keitany has not faded a bit as she hits the loneliest spot on the course , the queensboro bridge she still has a lead of more than two minutes and is still on pace to shatter the course record , which she would reset by more than six minutes if she keeps this pace

than a dozen runners hanging together lz it is always a given that the new york city marathon would never produce a world record time in the marathon because of the difficulty of the course , but mary

much of a race , the men are running in a large pack in the early going , with both emmanual and geoffrey mutai near the front of it , as is meb keflizighi lz the next group behind keitany is nowhere near her , but they are also under courserecord pace it includes buzunesh deba , caroline kilel , werknesh kidane , firehiwot dado and shewarge alene amare lz keitany s lead was up to 1 minute , 8 seconds at mile 7 , which she crossed in 35 56 the new york city marathon is rarely about the winning time the hilly course , the gusty winds and the race s policy of not using pacemakers works against running a good time here but keitany is ignoring all of those factors in taking the race out hard , by herself she already holds the world record in the half marathon and ran the london marathon in 2 19 19 london s course , however , is much more conducive to good times and has hosted several world record races there are time bonuses here , however , that will reward keitany handsomely should she break a course record the bonus goes as high as 70 , 000 if she goes under the 2 22 mark lz the men s race has started as the elite field leads the pack over the verrazzano

waitz would enjoy these 262 moments of reflection in waitz s place out on the course , her husband jack waitz , is running the marathon for her , and in her memory if he is able to battle through injuries and emotion to make it to the finish line , he will receive the medal along with everyone else on the back reads words of wisdom from his wife everybody is a winner liz robbins mary keitany has surged to a 12second lead over her nearest pursuers in the first 5k of the race , crossing that mark at 16 minutes , 3 seconds edison pena , the chilean miner who ran the race last year only weeks

on wednesday , amid all the hullabaloo over the budget battles , a simple , discrete and largely overlooked bill was dropped into the congressional hopper sponsored by two democrats and two republicans that s right an actual bipartisan piece of legislation its official title is the new alternative transportation to give americans solutions act , or the nat gas act , for short people in the know , however , call it the boone pickens bill boone pickens and i go way back he was the subject of my firstever business story , for texas monthly , nearly 30 years ago though we 've had our ups and downs since then , and though our politics are very different , i like and respect him in recent years , we 've become friends which is to say i 've got a bias here then again , so does boone although he is usually described as a texas oilman , that s a bit of a misnomer boone has spent most of his career drilling not for oil but for natural gas , which he knows more about than just about anyone his latelife occupation has been running a natural gasoriented hedge fund , which has made him , at the age of 82 , a billionaire several times over out of that deep knowledge has come a powerful belief that the country s energy salvation depends on moving away from the fuel we do n't have namely , oil , where imports , some of which come from our enemies \( to quote boone \) , account for twothirds of our oil needs instead , we should move to a fuel we have in abundance natural gas most experts say there is enough natural gas in the ground to last a century boone s convinced that modern drilling techniques will allow us to find enough for several centuries his critics like to point out that anything that boosts natural gas will put money in his pocket but so what \? he s already plenty rich , and , he says , i'm sure not doing this for the money besides , he s right the bill introduced last week is an offshoot of the pickens plan , his cri de coeur for energy independence , which he put together in 2008 and has spent more than 80 million promoting although boone believes that our continued reliance on opec oil is dangerous , he also knows that even if you drill , baby , drill , as many republicans want , it wo n't make much difference quite simply , america is running out of oil the pickens plan calls for increased use of wind , solar , nuclear , even coal i'm for anything that s american , he said but , of course , you ca n't use solar or wind to power a vehicle , which is what most imported oil is used for you can , however , use natural gas nor is this some pieinthesky technology there are already 12 million vehicles around the world that use either liquefied or compressed natural gas , though only 140 , 000 in the us \( they 're mostly buses and trash haulers \) the pickens bill creates tax incentives 1 billion a year for five years to encourage manufacturers to begin building heavyduty trucks that will be powered by natural gas instead of diesel it also gives some tax incentives to truckstop owners who install natural gas filling stations to help create the infrastructure on the face of it , this seems like a pretty small goal for a guy who s got such big ideas about energy independence partly , boone is being realistic it would be politically impossible to convert cars to natural gas or to ask for gigantic tax breaks in this time of austerity even so , this one small step could make a big difference of the 20 million barrels of oil we use each day , 70 percent goes for transportation fuel the 8 million heavyduty trucks on the road today account for 23 percent of that fuel although the tax incentives in the pickens bill would be enough to cover only about 140 , 000 new trucks , he hopes that it will catapult the industry toward natural gas even without the subsidies just moving the country s big trucks to natural gas , he says , could cut our opec imports in half every president since jimmy carter has called for the country to become more energy independent yet none of them have ever done anything to accomplish that the result is that our reliance on foreign oil has inexorably increased with the current turmoil in the mideast , the price of gasoline breaking the 4agallon barrier and the chinese becoming voracious competitors for imported oil , this would seem an ideal time to pass a law that could lessen our dependence on foreign crude oilmen are incorrigible optimists , and boone is no exception he thinks the bill will pass quickly not long ago , president obama spoke out in favor of it , in a speech that included a shoutout for boone already , the bill has attracted 157 cosponsors i think the house can pass it in 30 days , boone says i hope he s right natural gas is cheaper than oil it s cleaner and it s ours if congress ca n't pass this thing , there s really no hope
the prosecution of a somali national accused of supporting al qaeda is now headed for trial in a federal court , where it belonged all along the obama administration finally made the right decision over the usual selfserving objections of grandstanding senators from both parties but it is troubling that the administration delayed this step for almost two months during those months , ahmed abdulkadir warsame , who was seized by american forces in international waters , was secretly held in extralegal detention on a united states naval vessel there , he was interrogated without being read the miranda rights that apply to all federal criminal prosecutions after weeks of military investigation , a separate team of law enforcement officials concluded that he was not a legitimate candidate for military detention and trial they read him his rights he promptly waived them and continued cooperating with his captors , but it may prove hard to disentangle those later statements , fully admissible in court , from his earlier , inadmissible ones approving his secret interrogation at sea gave the administration a convenient alternative to sending him to guant namo bay , cuba that would have made trial in a civilian court nearly impossible , because congress has inexcusably hamstrung the justice system by barring the use of funds to transfer prisoners from the detention camp any suggestion that moving mr warsame to civilian court shows weakness against terrorism is absurd had mr warsame been brought before a military commission , prosecutors would have had to prove that he was either an actual member of al qaeda or was personally involved in plotting attacks on the united states but mr warsame is not accused of any actual terrorist acts , just material support of al qaeda and its alleged somali affiliate , the shabab in a civilian court , proving material support for the shabab alone would be enough to convict conviction on all counts of material support carries a possible life sentence so mr warsame s trial can proceed , but at an unfortunate cost president obama has created yet another parallel system of unlimited detention and interrogation without rights outside the constitutional norms that served us well for more than two centuries before the bush administration carelessly and needlessly tossed them aside for terrorism cases after sept 11 , 2001 the obama administration justifies its handling of the warsame case under the laws of war but mr warsame was not picked up on any recognized battlefield the administration claims continuing authority for military detention , interrogation and trial this applies not just to battlefield detentions , where it is often appropriate , but to detentions anywhere , and not just to personal involvement in violent attacks , but to a broad range of offenses directly or indirectly related to terrorism that is far too broad a claim two important goals must guide terroristrelated cases eliciting information to thwart future plots and punishing the guilty the overwhelming evidence from the past decade is that both are most reliably served by lawful interrogation and prosecution in civilian courts hundreds of accused terrorists have been convicted in civilian courts since 9 11 only six none of them major qaeda figures have been convicted in the military commissions carelessly confected by the bush administration and renewed , with significantly stricter rules and procedures , by the obama administration mr obama came to office vowing to stop these costly travesties of justice that so damaged america s international reputation but he has steadily retreated , sometimes in the face of political opposition , sometimes on his own now he is drifting toward establishing his own system of extralegal detention and tainted questioning it is time to stop that drift and return to a constitutional system of law enforcement
this is part five of a  steven weinberg has written eloquently in the new york review of books about kuhn and paradigm shifts a nobel prizewinning physicist was outlining the difference between kuhnian science \( that is , science as kuhn imagined it \) and actual science and argued that kuhn s theories did not characterize science as weinberg knew it weinberg wrote , what does bother me on rereading structure and some of kuhn s later writings is his radically skeptical conclusions about what is accomplished in the work of science conclusions that have made kuhn a hero to the philosophers , historians , sociologists , and cultural critics who question the objective character of scientific knowledge , and who prefer to describe scientific theories as social constructions , not so different from democracy or baseball or not so different from parapsychology , astrology or witchcraft he was also bothered by kuhn s arguments against progress kuhn went on to reason that there can be no sense in which theories developed after a scientific revolution can be said to add cumulatively to what was known before the revolution more recently , in his rothschild lecture at harvard in 1992 , kuhn remarked that it is hard to imagine what can be meant by the phrase that a scientific theory takes us close to the truth and yet , weinberg fails to drive the stake through the heart of the vampire if paradigms are incommensurable how can we talk about their incommensurability \? if the pythagoreans did not understand \( or could not have understood \) hippasus s proof because it was incommensurable with the pythagorean paradigm , then why bother killing him \? weinberg was taken \( as was i \) with an example that appears in kuhn s what are scientific revolutions \? it involves aristotle and a gestaltflip it also has a breathless , gee whiz character not unlike accounts of alien abductions and the experiences that follow you won t be able to understand it just take my word for it i first read some of aristotle s physical writings in the summer of 1947 , at which time i was a graduate student of physics trying to prepare a case study on the development of mechanics for a course in science for nonscientists i was sitting at my desk with the text of aristotle s physics open in front of me and with a fourcolored pencil in my hand looking up , i gazed abstractedly out the window of my room the visual image is one i still retain suddenly the fragments in my head sorted themselves out in a new way , and fell into place together my jaw dropped , for all at once aristotle seemed a very good physicist indeed , but of a sort i d never dreamed possible now i could understand why he had said what he d said , and what his authority had been statements that had previously seemed egregious mistakes now seemed at worst near misses within a powerful and generally successful tradition that sort of experience the pieces suddenly sorting themselves out and coming together in a new way is the first general characteristic of revolutionary change 82 alas , there is nothing here to tell us about the nature of the epiphany could it be like a religious conversion \? weinberg wrote to kuhn for an explanation excuse me , sir , just what is going on here but got none i guess a true epiphany cannot be explained it is ineffable it just happens and yet , i had \( and still have \) this nagging feeling that it is possible to compare aristotle s science with current modes of explanation even to make the claim that there has been progress during the last 2 , 000 or so years say in the field of dentistry to cite bertrand russell , aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men although he was twice married , it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives mouths or the variant from russell i prefer , aristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men , by the simple device of asking mrs aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted 83 norton wise was a postdoctoral student at princeton and eventually the director of graduate studies of the program in the history and philosophy of science \( from 1991 to 2000 \) , the same program that kuhn had directed in the 70s i had spent many , many evenings talking with him and , yes , complaining about kuhn i hadn t talked to him in 40 years , but at least for me , it was as if no time had passed except that he had young , twin daughters at the time they are now in their forties norton is much nicer than me in our conversation , i was reminded of his openness and sincerity norton wise do you remember the mode of smoking a cigarette , where kuhn would start drawing on a newly lit cigarette \? he would start a sentence , break off in the middle of the sentence , start drawing on the cigarette , and take a drag that would exhaust half the cigarette just an amazing drag and then start again in the sentence that s such a clear image to me errol morris i remember the mountain of butts and ash norton wise within one seminar errol morris oh yes norton wise that s what i remember too i never saw anyone smoke like that before or since of course the emphysema nearly killed him errol morris i often think of the attraction of smoking , that it simplifies the world into three parts there s you , there s the cigarette , and everything else is the ashtray norton wise well , the smoking is to me expressive of the intensity of the seminars everyone was on edge and that was from early on , and then continuing through successive seminars the most apparent thing is that intensity that kuhn somehow brought , along with the thorough preparation that he brought to it , and then expected of everyone else and of course very few people no one in the seminar would have read and analyzed the material in the very focused , intense way that he had done a kind of adversarial relationship was explicit you were challenged to be saying anything , or offering an opinion and an opinion immediately evoked maybe agreement , but usually not usually some kind of challenge and for me that meant that the relationship , while close and intense over the years , was always adversarial i found it extremely stimulating but sometimes disturbing sometimes very disturbing right up until the end , shortly before he died , he and i were carrying on this kind of contest of interpretation errol morris what an odd expression norton wise i wonder if it was in that seminar that i first became aware of it i was giving an interpretation of william thomson s lord kelvin s early electromagnetic mathematical work he sharply disagreed with my interpretation and said that it couldn t possibly be right because it didn t follow the steps through which thomson had developed his argument it was , instead , a physicist s way of going at things as an overview , or as a reinterpretation based on later knowledge it was the kind of thing he was constantly hammering against then the next week i came back with a new interpretation and again he attempted to shoot that down but this time i had done a great deal more homework and really had it down in a pretty focused , pretty detailed way and that maybe was the basis of the respect we gained for each other all of his students needed to show him that they could stand up to that adversarial mode of interaction , and challenge his own understanding which he greatly enjoyed for some people that worked out pretty well for others it was a complete disaster errol morris your use of the word adversarial \? i experienced it differently i would say that it went beyond adversarial there was a threatening element norton wise yes errol morris when i first came to princeton , he had given me an ultimatum that i was not to attend kripke s lectures norton wise i d never heard that very strange errol morris yes you may not go to those lectures norton wise so , of course , you immediately did errol morris yes our discussion turned to butterfield and whiggishness errol morris although you didn t use the word , i know it was on the tip of your tongue because you studied with him it was the supreme accusation whiggishness this is whiggish history i see the argument and i would love to know the details of the argument about thomson that you were norton wise , a recent phd in physics , thinking like a physicist and not like a historian and that you were providing some kind of anachronistic account norton wise that s precisely correct errol morris there seemed to be a kind of weirdness at the heart of all of it i don t know how else to express it the accusation of whiggishness was a cudgel norton wise yes , it certainly was used in that way to change one s rhetorical sensibilities errol morrs as a cudgel \? as a club \? norton wise yes i saw that i had to learn to work in a different mode i had to learn to write sentences differently i had to learn to interpret the way in which a text flowed from one line to the next in the course of a page errol morris but aren t you just talking about close reading \? norton wise yes 84 close reading \? who would argue with that \? close reading is entirely commendable three cheers for close reading but close reading is the opposite of incommensurability it tells us that by carefully studying a passage we can understand it incommensurability tells us that unless we inhabit the paradigm in which it was written , we can never understand it which brings me back to kripke and to naming and necessity why is kripke relevant to any of this \? i believe it is because his work is an attempt to create new links between words and things and between the present and the past although he is rarely described in this way , he is among other things , a philosopher of history we can believe strange things about the past , but we can still refer to things in the past  85 there is an objective reality there is objective truth and there is objective history 86 the beliefs of 6th century bce mathematicians might be inaccessible to us \( or at least , difficult for us to understand \) , but when hippasus or one of his contemporaries refer to 2 , they are referring to the same thing we are 87 indeed , it may come back to close reading truth , whose mother is history , rival of time , depository of deeds , witness of the past , exemplar and adviser to the present , and the future s counselor go back to goldie we can believe that goldie is golden or green or some other color , but we still refer to goldie as time goes by , our ideas about goldie \( and history \) may change , but that doesn t mean that we no longer refer to goldie or that goldie refers to one fish in one paradigm and a different fish in another nor does it mean that reference is contingent on a paradigm or on a conceptual scheme or disciplinary matrix i imagine one of those very bad elementary school arguments some kid says that the earth is flat i say that the earth is an oblate spheroid we argue it s flat no , it isn t yes , it is no , it isn t yes , it is no , it isn t stalemate we have reached an impasse kuhn steps in to adjudicate he tells us that there is no fact of the matter you come from different paradigms the flat earth paradigm and the oblate spheroid paradigm the name earth means something different to each of you , and you can t compare the meanings there is no common reference as kuhn wrote in structure , proponents of competing paradigms practice their trades in different worlds but wait what about the earth \? there is the earth there is that physical thing floating out in space is it flat , or is it an oblate spheroid \? or if it s neither , tell me what it is a tetrahedron \? isn t it one thing or another \? it must be something 88 i suppose the kid in elementary school , if he gets angry enough , could strangle me when all else fails , there s humpty dumpty s reply to alice and there s the ashtray argument with kuhn s blinkered cosmologies there really is no way to resolve these questions fisticuffs may be required please remember this is not an empty intellectual exercise it is not a matter of indifference whether it was god or natural selection that produced the complexity of life on earth nor whether there is such a thing as global warming the devaluation of scientific truth cannot be laid on kuhn s doorstep , but he shares some responsibility for it one more parable for those who truly believe that truth is subjective or relative \( along with everything else \) , ask yourself the question is ultimate guilt or innocence of a crime a matter of opinion \? is it relative \? is it subjective \? a jury might decide you re guilty of a crime that you haven t committed you re innocent \( it s possible the legal system is rife with miscarriages of justice \) nevertheless , we believe there is a fact of the matter you either did it or you didn t period if you were strapped into an electric chair , there would be nothing relative about it suppose you are innocent would you be satisfied with the claim there is no definitive answer to the question of whether you re guilty or innocent \? that there is no such thing as absolute truth or falsity \? or would you be screaming , i didn t do it look at the evidence i didn t do it nor would you take much comfort in the claim , it all depends on your point of view , doesn t it \? or what paradigm are you in \? when i was investigating the murder of robert wood , a dallas police officer , and the capital murder conviction of randall dale adams for that murder , would it make sense to describe my viewpoint as one paradigm , and the viewpoint of the dallas police as another \? surely , we had different ways of looking at the evidence , different interpretations of the evidence , different ways of looking at the crime suppose someone said , there s no way of comparing these two paradigms they re incommensurable you can t say one is true and the other false there is no absolute truth perhaps they could gussy up the claim by citing police procedures and practices different traditions of looking at crime scene evidence the social construction of the ashtray 89 the difficulty of ascertaining the truth in history is often confused with the relativity of truth two very different concepts \( we may have difficulty fixing the exact date and location of the battle of hastings , but that doesn t mean it didn t happen at a specific time and place \) the past , as lp hartley has written , is a foreign country they do things differently there 90 but when homer speaks of the sun , is he speaking about a different object than ts eliot \? if newton were to give einstein a copy of the principia and einstein were to give newton a copy of on the electrodynamics of moving bodies , would they be unable to understand each other or their respective theories \? there would be a discussion , perhaps even disagreements about ideas and principles clarifications would be needed but would they look past each other in numb stupefaction \? the past may be a foreign country , but i do not believe that people there speak a language that we can not understand acknowledgments charles silver provided many of the ideas in this essay i have benefited enormously over the years from our conversations about kripke , kuhn , meaning and reference ron rosenbaum , who despite a crazy schedule , read a number of drafts and made many helpful editorial suggestions i would like to thank my researchers and editors ann petrone , james larkin and julie fischer james larkin also provided a translation of hans freudenthal s essay on the foundational crisis in greek mathematics and my interview subjects , walter burkert , m norton wise , john burgess and stanley cavell i have also benefited from a conversation with steven weinberg and from his essay the revolution that didn t happen it is essential reading and conversations with warren goldfarb , louis menand and brian skyrms and i would also like to thank tom levin and the other princeton faculty members who invited me to give the spencer trask lecture at princeton in november , 2010 i have included an emended excerpt from the lecture as an epilogue errol morris thank you so much this is indeed very odd , being here i want to thank everybody connected with this lecture series for inviting me tonight i haven t been back to princeton for close to 40 years i tried to write some kind of lecture i don t think i really have it in me i can write essays and articles i don t think i can write lectures not this one but i started to write a lecture entitled the ashtray , because the ashtray is very much on my mind it concerned an ashtray that was thrown at my head at the institute for advanced study it may not have been the only reason why i left princeton , but it was the beginning of the end i started digging through stuff related to my experiences here i was very much devoted to rock climbing you may not be aware of this fact , but this is one of the best places to rock climb in the world the buildings are perfect for climbing and i was probably in the best shape that i had ever been i was arrested at a demonstration at the institute for defense analysis ida this is in 1972 and i was taken in a paddy wagon to trenton we were protesting the resumption of bombing in north vietnam this time , very close to the chinese border i was waiting to be booked , walked over to a window , and realized it was just a very easy matter to climb out the window , climb down the side of the building , and leave , which i did and i always felt a little bit ashamed of myself , because i thought , i should ve gotten arrested and booked and fingerprinted , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera there s probably no record of the fact that i was arrested in this demonstration it s always been unclear to me , in social protest , is the important thing to be there , to be arrested , to be beaten , to be in the newspaper , to be booked , or to be incarcerated \? maybe all of the above this last week i found an old issue of the princetonian online , and my name was there , in the paper , and it felt kind of good i was kind of pleased with myself , reading about the demonstration , reading about how a former president of princeton had said about the demonstration , this isn t princeton later , he claimed that he wasn t talking about the demonstrations , merely the fact that the ida was not formally located on the princeton campus i guess meanings are always in flux a lot of these experiences informed what i became as a filmmaker the things that i was concerned with in those days still are very much with me , still are very much part of what i do as a filmmaker the issue of murder , mass murder , has stayed with me over the years it s certainly part of the film that i made with robert s mcnamara , the fog of war i remember sitting in the firestone library and reading volumes upon volumes of the transcripts of the nuremberg war crimes tribunal ultimately i had the opportunity to go with robert mcnamara to the international criminal court icc in the hague , to show the fog of war to the court , and to answer questions with mcnamara and my two favorite moments from that experience going with mcnamara to visit the archivist for the icc mcnamara told him , i wish that they had these statutes governing war crimes back when i was secretary of defense , and the archivist replied , but , sir , they did another completely bizarre experience , beyond kafkaesque , seeing milosevic on the stand none of the proceedings had anything whatsoever to do with the content of the charges against him it was all procedural procedures about procedures about procedures , epicycle upon epicycle upon epicycle and yet , the knowledge that milosevic s crimes were being addressed , even if only in a vague and uncertain way , was gratifying at least someone was doing something milosevic was claiming that since he was representing himself , and since he was untrained as a lawyer , he should be given 9 5 more time than the prosecutors the 9 5th figure was arrived at through a complicated algorithm the other experiences i should mention really briefly i was taking classes from thomas kuhn , who ran the program in the history and philosophy of science where i was a graduate student , and saul kripke , who was giving a series of lectures naming and necessity it wasn t the first time he gave them this is 1972 it might have been the second , maybe even the third time they had been delivered it was risky for me to attend the kripke lectures , because i had been told by kuhn , under no circumstances are you allowed to go to these lectures it was an odd kind of thing years later , i ve come to realize that there was a debate embodied here about the nature of language of whether truth is socially constructed or whether ultimately concerns the relationship between language and reality i feel very strongly , even though the world is unutterably insane , there is this idea that we can reach outside of that insanity and find truth , some kind of certainty the thin blue line was one the most important experiences of my life , something that i remain really , really proud of overturning the conviction of a man who had been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit there are endless obstacles and impediments to finding the truth you might never find it it s an elusive goal but there s something to remember , there s a world out there that we can apprehend , and it s our job to go out there and apprehend it it s one of the deepest lessons that i ve taken away from my experiences here 82 thomas kuhn , what are scientific revolutions \? chapter 1 , the probabilistic revolution , vol 1 ideas in history ed lorenz kruger , lorraine j daston , michael heidelberger 1987 near misses is a curious phrase is kuhn comparing despite incommensurability aristotelian and contemporary physics \? it s hard to see how aristotle s conception of gravity is a near miss aristotle believed that a stone falls to the ground because it returns to the place from where it originated is this notion incommensurable with contemporary physics \? i don t think so it is simply false for example , i could take a stone from the earth to the moon , and presumably it would not try to return to the earth 83 bertrand russell , the impact of science on society london allen unwin 1952 variant from russell , an outline of intellectual rubbish girrard , kan haldemanjulius publications 1943 perhaps kuhn , given his love of incommensurability , concluded that mrs aristotle had an irrational number of molars as an example of how this kind of talk can lead to nonsense , the nobel prize was awarded in 2005 to two researchers who established the cause of peptic ulcers gone were rolaids and the claim that they could consume 47 times their weight in excess stomach acid stomach acid was no longer the issue they traced the disease to the bacterium helicobacter pylori this has been described in many articles as a paradigm shift a paradigm shift ! \? is this what it amounts to \? a change in belief \? ! 84 wise sent me a followup email you were interested in two particular features of tom s mode of working the first concerns the ability to qualify his statements so as to almost make a strong claim without actually making it an example appears in his classic article on energy conservation \( p 100 in the essential tension , where he says unless the naturphilosophie indigenous to the educational environment of these seven men had a productive role in the researches of some , it is hard to see why more than half of the pioneers should have been drawn from an area barely through its first generation of significant scientific productivity nor is this quite all if proved , the influence of naturphilosophie may also help to explain why this particular group of five germans , a dane , and an alsatian includes five of the six pioneers in whose approaches to energy conservation we have previously noted such marked conceptual lacunae in other words , i have not done the research to find actual evidence for this role of naturphilosophie , but it is true nonetheless , unless of course it turns out not to be i have never mastered this mode of writing , though i recognize its effectiveness effective ! \? i assume that norton is being ironic em second , i cited an example of my own experience in working on the electrical theory of william thomson , lord kelvin , in order to show why kuhn s critique of whiggish interpretation had great power in the detailed reading of texts i was presenting in seminar thomson s mathematical result on how electrical force f changes to f across the boundary of an insulator of inductive capacity k , so that f f 1 k this presented problems because thomson claimed to be reasoning on the basis of a flow analogy to conduction of heat across a surface where the conductivity changed and his equation for the effect did not seem to follow from this view i gave an account of his thinking which was based \( implicitly \) on a modern physicist s understanding of electrostatic induction tom insisted \( strenuously and adversarially \) that my account could not be correct because it did not preserve the relation between thomson s verbal statements and his equation it was whiggish , which is the basic lesson here the story continues , however , with its characteristically adversarial nature he asserted an interpretation of his own which i in turn thought could not be right and said so i then spent a great deal of time and effort on the problem and returned the next week to show why he was wrong and to present yet another account , which turned out to solve the difficulties and to give considerable insight into thomson s mode of analysis the whig story and the adversarial story are about equally important in my perception of the simultaneously intellectual and psychological struggle in working with tom are they two separate stories the whig and the adversarial or is it all adversarial \? em 85 of course , it is still possible to be skeptical about kripke s claim , namely that a historical chain of intentions guarantees that we can refer to things in the past but it is , at least , an attempt to provide an alternative to the descriptivist picture of how we refer to things 86 kripke never tells us that we can recover beliefs from the past i have often wondered ok , we can refer to pythagoras without knowing anything about him but if we don t know anything about him , what good does it do to be able to refer to him \? 87 2 refers to the same thing prehippasus as it does posthippasus , even though our beliefs about 2 may have changed 88 ralph waldo emerson in his essay selfreliance weighed in on this issue , their every truth is not quite true their two is not the real two , their four not the real four so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right 89 as john burgess , a professor of philosophy at princeton , told me in an interview kuhn speaks one way when speaking to historians , and another way when speaking to philosophers the trouble begins when he starts talking about things being socially constructed as far as i m concerned , the stars can t be socially constructed the stars are billions of years old , and human society is not billions of years old and so the latter cannot have constructed the former on the other hand , if you just say astronomy is socially constructed , well , that s a trivial truism who would deny that \? before there was human society , there weren t any astronomers , and there wasn t any astronomy there is some philosophical issue here , but it s these modes of expression they are just a sloppy way of talking throwing around these expressions is in fact concealing issues rather than illuminating anything it is encouraging a fallacious jump from the thought since astronomy is constructed , therefore , the things astronomy is about are constructed , or something like that and when speaking with philosophers , kuhn would deny holding this outrageous belief but when speaking to historians , he d go back to using this language 90 from lp hartley , the opening lines of the gobetween , london h hamilton 1953
on monday , we ran a about john paton , a longtime newspaper executive who thinks the problems with print media may be solved by printing less the conventions of a news story require that a long conversation get boiled down to a few pithy quotes because of the size of mr paton s gamble he is now running both the journal register and medianews newspaper chains we thought it might be worthwhile to run a longer version of the interview the following conversation has been edited for clarity nyt when you look over the hill in the newspaper industry , what do you see \? paton i think you re going to see a couple things i think you re going to see a steady , for the next five years , a steady 5 to 7 percent decline in print advertising after that , you re going to see probably a flattening out and down less , about 1 or 2 percent a year , because things are happening that are making that a better proposition than the past there s print subscriptions now and there s digital subscriptions , whether it s an eedition or ipad , so that is new revenue and could grow to be meaningful nyt why are you so frantic about growing digital revenues \? paton if you re not growing digital revenue , if you don t have a plan to grow it 50 to 75 percent , you won t be able to keep up no matter what , it is going to be a smaller business in terms of topline revenue , you re going to have to go after costs , you re going to have to go after the infrastructure costs that are in the print part of the business , because you have to be investing in the digital side of the business that gets you back to the capital structure , there s no money in the marketplace to fund this , so you have to selffund it through your own revenues nyt or fire a lot of people you ve done plenty of that , right \? paton i fired a lot of people it s tough , it really is you can t get to where we need to go with digital revenue and with what s happening to print without making a much more efficient , leaner cost structure than you had before it won t support it nyt you talk about getting rid of print , but that s where the money is we put the white paper on the street because people give us green paper , cash money , back paton a lot of it nyt in terms of digital revenues , you face the tyranny of small numbers it takes so much money to sell and collect on all those small digital ads it s a big lift for newspapers that used to have monopolies and used scarcity and premium positions in their papers to push the price of their ads now they are just one of a number of media properties selling local paton i can argue the other way there is this kind of holy grail about local , whether it s called hyperlocal or whatever the term is in social and mobile newspapers have the largest local audience for news of anybody in their area in our markets , we have the biggest news army and the biggest local sales army nyt so why have newspapers struggled so much \? paton because really bad managers go after the easiest things cut the marketing , cut the news hole , cut the newsroom , which they don t understand , and in some cases , cut sales when things got cut over the last 15 years and particularly in the last seven , it s mostly editorial resources we re trying to do something different , more strategic in small dailies , about half of the entire editorial force is just putting stuff on a page if it s thursday you re putting the health page together , if it s friday you re doing whatever section , and that isn t a good use of resources we are about 40 percent local and 60 percent whatever else wire , syndicated stuff and none of it was standardized so you got some guy pulling together the national page in one of the papers to make a long story short , jim brady and i sat down and worked to see if we could free up these editors by taking over that 60 percent in some kind of centralized way and put people in charge of it who can do a good job of it you get savings and a better product nyt what you re talking about is centralizing some aspects of editorial production paton we re talking to politico about doing a partnership over politics we have a deal with thestreetcom to do investor information both online and print we end up with quality coverage we wouldn t have and take a 12person newsroom and make it a 10person newsroom , but everybody is out on the street , doing local coverage or editing local coverage if we have 18 papers , there is scale there , but now that we are doing medianews as well , we have 75 daily newspapers , so the scale is there that can make it a lot easier nyt you know newspaper people hate this to them , making a paper is making a paper , putting it together in all aspects paton i know i was an editor i was an editor in chief i was a managing editor i am saying that the competitive advantage we have left is to be on the street locally gathering news , because we are going to have less money down the road , less revenue over the next five to seven years , not more revenue , and if i want to preserve the news gathering process and resources nyt but papers in your chain are giving up control deciding what goes in the newspaper paton they re still deciding everything that goes in the local pages , they re still deciding what goes on the front page , they re simply , basically , pressing buttons to have other people get that done nobody is taking over that front page , no one is taking over the fact that the mayor story is less important than the x , y , z story nyt are all your papers going to end up looking the same \? paton i think we re going to end up with three or four common templates depending on the size of the paper , some are tabs , some are broadsheet , and some are square tabs as we call them that s the hardest part for me to get over right now , should they be a common template \? the smaller the newspaper the easier it is to sell this , the bigger the newspaper , it s almost impossible and now that we have medianews group , we might end up having to carve out the bigger papers because it s not good for them the denver post is a much different animal than the middletown paper , it just is nyt i think you re just doing carveouts because you don t want to anger your biggest papers paton here s the thing about being ceo somebody s always mad at you you get used to it , but i don t have to pick every fight that s out there i haven t thought it through it hadn t really been an issue for us until we took over operating medianews on sept 6 nyt it s a lot bigger canvas you are working on how much bigger \? paton medianews group is just a little over three times bigger than jrc so you re looking well north of a billion dollars in revenue and over 10 , 000 employees in 18 states together , there are 75 dailies in that group nyt what about the smaller community weeklies \? paton actually inside the journal register company , they re stronger than the dailies , even online everybody has tried to crack the code on weeklies how are we going to do high school sports \? the truth of the matter is people have been fibbing about that on friday night , how many football games can you cover \? now , with parents sending iphone photos of games and scores that are tweeted out , you get a bigger , better picture you just have to capture it nyt are you planning on taking over the world or just saving a couple of newspapers \? paton i m not planning on taking over the world at all , but these businesses will scale the brands are hugely important , what they stand for , people trust them if you can create a business structure that lets you put more resources local , they will do well nyt some of the papers you took over seem to stand for years of disinvestment and neglect paton that s certainly been some of their history but go to torrington , conn see what they say about what s been happening with the brand they trust it i know they do i talked to them we ve held open meetings there , that s where we have the open public news and so people do trust it we ve certainly done everything in our power it seems over the last decade to try to erode that trust , there s no doubt about it as we cut back on coverage but in the main , newspapers are a trusted brand and there s tons of research that speaks to that it is a huge benefit in terms of selling advertising nyt what do you think of patch , aol s local effort \? paton patch isn t going to scale you can t do this on the cheap if you re following the patch model , that s a person in editorial and a person in sales for middletown , conn , which is where we have our smallest daily we have a dozen people in the newsroom and about an equal number of people in sales i m a big proponent of what crowdsourcing can do , but crowdsourcing is not a substitute for professional journalism newspapers have already scaled we have the benefit of everything that went on before us and we already have local sales , local feet on the street when it comes to news we need to invest more for sure , but it is a lot easier than building from scratch and that s what patch is trying to do you re not supposed to say this in the blogosphere , but i think newspapers are going to dominate online news they already are
tokyo japan s nuclear crisis intensified again wednesday , with japanese authorities announcing that a containment vessel in a second reactor unit at the stricken fukushima daiichi plant in northeastern japan may have ruptured and appeared to be releasing radioactive steam that would be the second vessel to be compromised in two days the vessel had appeared to be the last fully intact line of defense against largescale releases of radioactive materials from that reactor , but it was not clear how serious the possible breach might be the announcement came after japanese broadcasters showed live footage of thick plumes of steam rising above the plant yukio edano , the chief cabinet secretary , said the government believed the steam was coming from the no 3 reactor , where an explosion on monday blew out part of the building surrounding the containment vessel the reactor has three layers of protection that building the containment vessel , and the metal cladding around fuel rods , which are inside the reactor the government has said that those rods at the no 3 reactor were likely already damaged a spike in radiation levels at the plant as the steam was rising forced some of the relatively few workers left at the plant to retreat indoors , suspending some critical efforts to pump water into several reactors to keep them cool earlier in the morning , the company that runs the plant reported that a fire was burning at a different reactor , just hours after officials said flames that erupted tuesday had been doused a government official at japan s nuclear regulatory agency soon after said that flames and smoke were no longer visible , but he cautioned that it was unclear if the fire , at the reactor no 4 building , had died out he also was not clear if it was a new fire or if the fire tuesday had never gone out there are a total of six reactors at the plant the developments are troubling reminders of the difficulties the company is having in bringing the plant , which has suffered multiple explosions since saturday , under control and the confusion is emblematic of days of often contradictory reports about what is happening at the plant the company , tokyo electric power , says it cannot know for sure what is happening in many cases because it is too dangerous for workers to get close to some reactors the situation became especially dire on tuesday , when releases of radiation led the company to pull most of its workers from the plant among the authorities' main concerns are pools for spent fuel rods at several reactors at the plant , including reactor no 4 , where the pool has lost some of the water needed to keep the fuel rods stable the rods are still radioactive and potentially as hot and dangerous as the fuel rods inside the reactors minoru ogoda , the official with japan s nuclear regulatory agency , said a proposed plan to use helicopters to put more cold water into the pool was looking unlikely the hole or holes in the roof caused by an earlier blast did not appear big enough to allow sufficient amounts of water in , he said he said tokyo electric would probably try to spray water into the reactor building through a gaping hole in the wall blasted open by the explosion that explosion on tuesday was caused by hydrogen gas bubbling up from chemical reactions set off by the fuel rods in the pool , japanese officials said inspectors from the united states nuclear regulatory commission said they had been told by japanese authorities that what was burning was lubricating from machinery near the pool concern remained high about the storage pools at two other reactors , nos 5 and 6 none of those three reactors at the plant , 140 miles northeast of tokyo , were operating on friday afternoon when an offshore earthquake with a magnitude now estimated at 90 shook the site a tsunami rolled into the northeast japanese coastline minutes later , swamping the plant at least 750 workers were evacuated on tuesday morning after a separate explosion ruptured the inner containment building at reactor no 2 at the daiichi plant , which was crippled by friday s earthquake and tsunami the closely spaced but apparently coincidental explosions at reactors nos 2 and 4 together released a surge of radiation 800 times as intense as the recommended hourly exposure limit in japan but 50 workers stayed behind , a crew no larger than would be stationed at the plant on a quiet spring day taking shelter when possible in the reactor s control room , which is heavily shielded from radiation , they struggled through the morning and afternoon to keep hundreds of gallons of seawater a minute flowing through temporary fire pumps into the three stricken reactors , nos 1 , 2 and 3 , where overheated fuel rods continued to boil away the water at a brisk pace by early afternoon radiation levels had plunged , according to the international atomic energy agency workers have released surges of radiation each time they bleed radioactive steam from the troubled reactors in an attempt to manage the pressure inside them , but the reactors are not yet releasing high levels of radiation on a sustained basis , japanese officials said the united states military revised its plans as radiation from the plant worsened some american warships that had been expected to arrive at the tsunamishattered northeast coast of honshu island were diverted to the west coast instead because of concerns about radiation , the navy said the navy also promised to continue relief missions even though several more helicopter crews were testing positive for lowlevel exposure to radiation , and even as american military personnel and their families at the yokosuka and atsugi bases were encouraged to take precautions against radiation exposure late tuesday morning , prime minister naoto kan warned in a nationally televised address of rising radiation mr edano , the chief cabinet secretary , urged people who live within about 18 miles of the plant to take precautions please do not go outside , please stay indoors , please close windows and make your homes airtight , he said yukiya amano , the director general of the international atomic energy agency , said at the organization s vienna headquarters that there was a possibility of core damage at reactor no 2 , but that the damage is estimated to be less than 5 percent of the fuel the sudden turn of events , after an explosion on monday at one reactor and then an earlymorning explosion on tuesday at yet another the third in four days at the plant had already made the crisis at the plant the worst nuclear accident since the chernobyl reactor disaster a quartercentury ago it had become impossible for workers to remain at many areas within the plant for extended periods , the agency said in tokyo , the metropolitan government said tuesday that it had detected radiation levels 20 times above normal over the city , though it stressed that such levels posed no immediate health threat and that readings had dropped since then the explosion in reactor no 2 , a little after 6 am on tuesday , particularly alarmed japanese officials and nuclear power experts around the world because it was the first detonation at the plant that appeared to occur inside one of the primary containment vessels those buildings are fortresslike structures of steel and reinforced concrete , designed to absorb the impact of a plane crash and minimize radiation leaks after a series of conflicting reports about how much damage the reactor had sustained after that blast , mr edano said , there is a very high probability that a portion of the containment vessel was damaged japanese officials subsequently said that the explosion had damaged a doughnutshaped steel container of water , known as a torus , that surrounds the base of the reactor vessel inside the primary containment building ruptures in the torus are serious , said michael friedlander , a senior nuclear power plant operator for 13 years at three plants in the united states , including three years at a general electric boiling water reactor very similar to the ones in trouble in japan but the torus is not as important as the reactor vessel itself , which has 67inchthick steel walls and 84inchthick steel for its roof and floor the vessel is designed to hold very highpressure steam as well as the uranium fuel rods the reactor vessel has 20 safety valves that during a shutdown of the reactor inject steam into a milliongallon suppression pool of water in a steel torus immediately underneath it imagine if you had a big pressure cooker and you had a tube off the pressure cooker into a big tub of water the suppression pool is the tub of water , said mr friedlander , a defender of nuclear power who is now a money manager in hong kong steam vented into the suppression pool from the reactor vessel is not supposed to be radioactive but it becomes radioactive , and potentially very radioactive , if the fuel rods in the reactor vessel above have begun to melt the atmosphere in the primary containment building , around the reactor vessel and above the suppression pool , is supposed to consist of inert nitrogen , with no oxygen at all an inert atmosphere is used in the primary containment building to avoid the risk of oxygen explosions with hydrogen if the reactor starts producing much larger quantities of hydrogen gas than usual hydrogen gas is highly combustible with oxygen
when raj rajaratnam was a hedge fund baron managing billions of dollars and being lionized as one of wall streets savviest investors , he was asked what made him so successful it is pride , and i want to win , said mr rajaratnam , the cofounder of the galleon group hedge fund , according to the 2001 book the new investment superstars , by lois peltz i want to win every time taking calculated risks gets my adrenaline pumping a decade later , mr rajaratnam is taking the biggest calculated risk of his life beginning tuesday , he will be seated at the defense table in a federal courtroom in manhattan in the biggest insider trading trial in a generation , mr rajaratnam , 53 , is fighting charges that he made 45 million trading on illegal stock tips if a jury convicts mr rajaratnam , he faces up to 20 years in prison the trial promises to deliver gripping law orderlike drama , complete with confidential informants , wiretapped phone conversations and highprofile witnesses , including potential testimony from lloyd c blankfein , chief executive of goldman sachs it will also shine a spotlight on the hedge fund industry , which over the past decade has emerged as one of the most powerful forces on wall street the trial , expected to last sixtoeight weeks , will also display the unusual investigatory tactics the justice department has used in its pursuit of insider trading techniques traditionally used in pursuing organized crime employing these tools , the investigation has reached into the upper echelons of corporate america and high finance just last week , federal prosecutors named rajat k gupta , a former director of goldman and procter gamble , as a coconspirator in the case the odds are stacked heavily against mr rajaratnam the government wins about 90 percent of federal trials , according to department of justice data federal prosecutors say they have overwhelming evidence of mr rajaratnam s illicit trading they have told judge richard j holwell , who is overseeing the case , that they could play 173 secretly recorded telephone conversations between mr rajaratnam and his associates , some of whom are his supposed coconspirators the government says that mr rajaratnam illegally traded in 35 different stocks nineteen traders in mr rajaratnam s orbit have already pleaded guilty to insider trading , several of whom are cooperating with the government and are expected to testify legal experts say that even if there is a low probability of an acquittal , there is little motivation for mr rajaratnam to plead guilty now , 17 months after federal agents arrested him in his sutton place apartment in manhattan on securities fraud and conspiracy charges the deals you get for pleading guilty usually come early in the process , so if he were to plead now versus a guilty verdict after a trial , the sentence he would get by pleading might not be very different from the sentence after the verdict , said mark cohen , a partner at cohen gresser and a former federal prosecutor friends and former colleagues also say that the sri lankanborn mr rajaratnam is a proud and dignified family man who maintains his innocence a prominent philanthropist , especially to south asian causes , mr rajaratnam feels that not only his reputation rests on his vindication , but also that of the entire south asian immigrant community and his sri lankan countrymen , friends say if raj pleaded , he would be admitting that he committed a crime and to admit guilt is not an option , said a former galleon employee who worked with mr rajaratnam for a decade and would speak only on the condition of anonymity but if a jury finds him guilty , he can say he was wrongfully convicted a centerpiece of mr rajaratnam s defense is the socalled mosaic theory of investing galleon practiced a method of picking stocks built by relentlessly pressing for pieces of information about companies to form a mosaic a fuller picture intended to give it an edge on other investors lawyers for mr rajaratnam are expected to argue that their client did not know he was trading on confidential , marketmoving tips from company executives and other informants who breached a duty to not reveal the information instead , they will assert that mr rajaratnam , like a dogged investigative journalist , worked with disparate sources to collect as much data as he could about the companies in which he invested throughout his career mr rajaratnam has worked tirelessly as permitted by the securities laws to build a mosaic of public information about the companies he follows , john dowd , his lead trial lawyer , has said his detailed , meticulous research into company fundamentals distinguished him as an exceptional analyst and portfolio manager mr rajaratnam came to the united states to study business at the university of pennsylvania s prestigious wharton school as a young stock picker at needham company , he earned a reputation for possessing a vast network of sources in the technology industry
cairo in the end , president obama made a hugely important but unintended contribution to the democracy revolution in egypt because the obama team never found the voice to fully endorse the tahrir square revolution until it was over , the people in that square now know one very powerful thing they did this all by themselves that is so important one of the most powerful chants i heard in the square on friday night was the people made the regime step down this sense of selfempowerment and authenticity we did this for ourselves , by ourselves is what makes egypt s democracy movement such a potential gamechanger for the whole region and in case other autocrats have n't picked up on that , let me share my second favorite chant from the streets of cairo after president hosni mubarak resigned it was directed at the dictator next door , col muammar elqaddafi of libya , and it went like this we 're not leaving tahrir until qaddafi leaves office hello , tripoli ! cairo calling this could get interesting for all the region s autocrats egypt s youthful and resourceful democrats are just getting started up to now , the democracy movement in the arab world was largely confined to the usled liberation of iraq , which , because it was usled , has not been able to serve as a model for emulation if , and it remains a big if , egypt can now make the transition to democracy , led by its own youth and under the protection of its own armed forces , watch out the message coming out of cairo will be we tried nasserism we tried islamism and now we 're trying democracy but not democracy imported from britain or delivered by america democracy conceived , gestated and born in tahrir square that will resonate among arabs and in iran some people worry , though , that the egyptian army will strangle this egyptian democracy movement in its crib personally , i think the army leadership is a little afraid of the twitterenabled tahrir youth the democracy movement that came out of tahrir square is like a tiger that has been living in a tiny cage for 30 years having watched it get loose , there are two things i would say about this tiger one is that anyone who tries to put it back in that little cage will get his head bitten off and , two , any politician who tries to ride the tiger for his own narrow interests , not for the benefit egypt , will get eaten by it as well iran , the other day , issued a declaration urging the tahrir youth to make an islamic revolution , and none other than egypt s muslim brotherhood told tehran to get lost because the democracy movement here is panegyptian and includes christians and muslims but here s the big question in egypt now can this youthled democracy movement take the power and energy it developed in tahrir square , which was all focused on one goal getting rid of hosni mubarak and turn it into a sustainable transition to democracy , with a new constitution , multiple political parties and a free presidential election in a timely fashion \? here , the movement s strength the fact that it represented every political strain , every segment and class in egyptian society is also its weakness it still has no accepted political platform or leadership it is essential that the democracy movement now form its own leadership and lay down its own vision and priorities which it can hold the government to otherwise , all this effort can be lost , cautioned rachid mohamed rachid , the liberal former minister of trade and industry , who declined to continue serving in mubarak s cabinet before the revolt happened they have to have a vision of what egyptian education should be , about agriculture policy and human rights getting rid of mubarak was not the only hope that ultimate goal is to have a new egypt ever since this revolt started , america , israel and saudi arabia seemed to hope that there were two choices here one called stability that would somehow involve mubarak , and the other called instability , which was to be avoided well , let me put this as plainly as possible here in egypt , stability has left the building for which i say good riddance or as ahmed zewail , the egyptianamerican nobel prizewinning chemist , put it to me egypt was stable these past 30 years because it had no vision , no aspiration and was stagnating that kind of stability could n't last that s why today egypt has before it only two paths , and both are unstable one is where this democracy movement falters and egypt turns into an angry pakistan , as it was under the generals and the other is the necessarily unstable , up and down transition to democracy , which ends stably with egypt looking like indonesia or south africa this will be hard many tough days lie ahead , but they will be made much easier thanks to the selfconfidence bred here among egypt s youth the past three weeks watching so many egyptians take pride in their generally peaceful birth of freedom to listen to them say in different ways to themselves and each other , i am somebody was to witness one of the great triumphs of the human spirit
rafael nadal of spain applied relentless pressure on andy murray of britain to win a place in the us open men s final for the second successive year with a 64 , 62 , 36 , 62 victory on saturday night nadal will face novak djokovic of serbia for the title following the wimbledon champion s fiveset victory over roger federer earlier in the day a fourthset letdown buried murray s hopes after recovering from a twosetstonone deficit nadal broke murray s serve six times while murray managed only two service breaks as the match rushed to conclusion after 3 hours , 24 minutes nadal s slashing forehand winner down the line to murray s backhand corner boosted his lead to 52 in the fourth set nadal won his serve emphatically to open the fourth set , hitting an ace up the t to take the game at love this is the kind of energy that can wear down an opponent and murray needs to resist the temptation to lose heart he raced to net on his serve for a pictureperfect backhand volley to win one point as nadal s return barely cleared the net then nadal slapped a forehand long he , too , needs to keep the pressure on his scottish foe murray refused to lay back , charging the net repeatedly and winning his serve soon , however , he squandered a crucial point , lobbing over nadal s head and forcing him back to the baseline , then jamming a forehand into the net murray looked like he was ready to slam his racket to the ashe stadium surface , but didn t anger management triumphant it may have helped him attempt to surmount the next challenge trying to keep nadal from winning his serve he failed , however , losing a 27stroke rally and bashing a backhand wide to succumb to nadal s continuing pressure umpire bernardes watched benevolently as murray interrupted play to don a pair of black wristbands , then stepped to the service line seconds later , he slammed a forehand long and gave nadal the game and a 31 lead that could mean the end of the tournament for murray murray shouted c mon ! and shook his fist when he broke nadal in the eighth game of this set it gave him a 53 lead and it brought his entourage to its feet in the player box charging the net and putting away a volley made murray look suddenly powerful was nadal fading \? under murray s relentless strokes , it seemed that way he took a 4015 lead and stood at set point and then risked all on a drop shot that sailed too deep nadal tracked it down and dropped it back murray bent forward but couldn t begin to run for it , as nadal jammed another forehand into the corner and murray hit it long two set points squandered but murray soon fulfilled the promise of his net rushes , taking to the forecourt and swinging a volley for another winner nadal couldn t get a backhand back on the next point and lost the set murray ran down a forehand that seemed to pull him into new jersey and hit a winner up the line but he rubbed his back as he walked back into position whatever the situation , nadal double faulted on the next point , his first of the match when murray slammed a backhand long , he shouted oh my god ! when he did it again on the next point , he jammed his left hand into his mouth up to the knuckles and bit down the sounds of the match continued to make a kind of urban symphony murray s voice came out eeeeh ! nadal s came out uhhh ! there wasn t the shrieking quality so familiar elsewhere in tennis the brazilian baritone of chair umpire carlos bernardes added a touch of resonance does this have anything to do with tennis \? let me know , dear reader murray revived in the second game of the third set both played the best point of the match so far and winning it was a significant boost for murray he broke nadal s serve on a point in which both players raced the width of the court , slicing back returns of balls that seemed far out of reach nadal attempted this one time too many , getting the ball back , but then watching murray hit a backhand volley that flew down and away and couldn t be reached for the first time , murray was up a break was he climbing out of the coffin \? not exactly he immediately lost his serve back did i say this could be a long match \? did i ever make a mistake before \? nadal won the second set in 49 minutes with four straight winning points on his serve he headed for his chair like he might be in a hurry on the changeover , nadal sat for a moment and drew a cheer when he changed shirts murray glanced into the stands the music blared this may not be a long match nadal is dominating almost every point , controlling the ball masterfully murray has tremendous power but seems stymied about what to do to change the direction of play nadal weathered a storm of break points and held serve to pull even at 11 he fared less well a few weeks ago on the culinary front , where , according to abiz in croatia my understanding from nadalnewscom is that the injury to his fingers is the result of severe burns \( with blisters \) that he acquired when he picked up a very hot plate in a restaurant in cincinnati when playing there last month in a tournament thank you , abiz ! back on the tennis front , murray hit a sizzling ontherun forehand from off court to the corner of nadal s court , an almost identical shot to the one nadal hit in the previous set and yes , sizzling was a bad pun murray shouted andy ! and something else after hitting an easy backhand into the net in the fourth game something else is not a euphemism for a swear word i just couldn t hear it i would swear i did hear murray say to his box of friends , family , and advisors i know how to play this guy a moment later he rushed net and got passed by nadal then he jammed another backhand into the net it didn t look like he was following his own game plan , at least the one that says be careful of rushing net if you can t force the point , or at least control it nadal held a break point a moment later and lost it in a furious exchange in which murray rushed net and slanted a drop volley cross court but he punched a volley wide a moment later and yielded the game  jim luttrell there are two pieces of tape on nadal s right hand , not his ballstriking side , evidence of a kitchen accident \( i think \) if anybody knows , post a comment no reason to restrict this narrative to me it was no accident when nadal took a 150 lead in the 10th game he fired a rifleshot forehand cross court deep into murray s corner murray had no chance to reach it this was not the time to ease up , and nadal didn t he kept focused , a key ingredient if he is to win this match soon he had a set point and won it , taking the first set in 55 minutes  jim luttrell nadal has just broken murray s serve in what could be a key turn this is a slugfest the sound of the balls on court is thunderous top players listen as well as look , and a soft shot makes its presence known , too murray is having to be alert to drop shots he held break points in the sixth game but couldn t convert nadal looked away from one shot and couldn t keep it in the court or within 10 feet of the baseline still , he refused to yield the game went back and forth through three deuces before nadal , drawn far off court to his left , slashed a forehand into the corner and took the game when nadal looped a backhand lob over murray s head , murray turned , started back , then let the ball drop about two feet inside the baseline murray screamed in anger at his mistake soon he was down three break points he hit two shots to bludgeon his opponent into errors , but took his eye off a forehand that reached nearly to the box seats at the end of the court first service break to nadal this could be a long match  jim luttrell nadal is worried about murray s first serve he praised it to a courtside interviewer as he came on court , probably not as a ploy , since murray wouldn t be listening as the match has developed , murray has been pounding his first serve into the corner and up the t , proving that nadal s concern is wise nadal has been pounding on his own and backed murray off in the third game , forcing four deuces murray slammed still another serve up the t \( middle \) and nadal couldn t get it back , then murray pushed a forehand into the corner nadal didn t move as smoothly as usual and sent it into the net both players are on serve  jim luttrell
had virtually no peers in his chosen sport , but in the court of law he had 12 of them on wednesday , those peers convicted bonds of one count of obstruction of justice , which will stay with bonds forever this huge decision , with three other counts ending in a hung jury , points to bonds s evasiveness before a grand jury about the use of a needle that is to say , cheating involving his line of work he was probably convicted of that one count because of those words and also because of , his former personal shopper , kathy hoskins , who clearly did not want to be in that courtroom in san francisco barry was like , just do it right here , ' hoskins testified last week , saying she had seen bonds with his personal trainer , greg anderson barry just lifted his shirt up and he said this is katie she s my girl she s not going to say nothing to nobody' hoskins said that anderson then gave bonds an injection in the abdomen and that bonds told her that s a little somethin' somethin' when i go on the road you ca n't detect it bonds , 46 , will appeal and try to avoid prison time , which is his right , but baseball also has to figure out what to do about the slugger who retired after the 2007 season even the one count of obstruction implicates the entire industry , for engaging in omert during the home run frolics of the late 1990s and early in this decade yes , the country has bigger problems , and yes , the trial was expensive , but people should care about this one conviction because of bonds s denial of the needle there are rules against performanceenhancing drugs in sport , partly to ensure a level playing field and partly because those drugs can be unhealthy for young people by his own behavior , bonds acted as if he knew he was breaking rules he did not care , but we must there are precedents for prominent people in sports who break rules george m steinbrenner was suspended for several years for and narrowly escaped jail pete rose is ineligible for the hall of fame because he while managing the reds baseball now has a legal reason for making bonds ineligible for the hall it s a shame , in a way , because bonds was one of the greatest mixtures of speed and power ever to put on a baseball uniform he was on his way to a hall of fame career in his mid20s , long before he bulked up and began hitting  baseball is now stuck with more than a guilty verdict for barry lamar bonds it is also stuck with a stretch limousine full of the biggest sluggers of this generation mark mcgwire , sammy sosa , rafael palmeiro and that admitted partaker of steroids , alex rodriguez , who is after a homer wednesday , to say nothing of manny ramirez , who facing a 100game suspension for testing positive for banned drugs baseball cannot very well negate bonds s 762 career home runs or his 73 homers in 2001 he hit them this is not one of those ncaa deals in which a basketball team vacates its place in the final four for one violation or another besides , bonds undoubtedly hit some of those home runs off pitchers who were bulking up off roger clemens , who got himself in trouble in 2008 in front of the  perhaps lulled by the blatant fawning by some members of the committee , clemens came off as a blowhard as he denied using performanceenhancing drugs apparently , the counsels later advised committee members that clemens s story did not add up and in july there is some commonality between bonds and clemens , in that both relied on a trainer bonds s man , greg anderson , chose to go to jail rather than testify , whereas clemens s man , brian mcnamee once lauded as a genius who knew how to get clemens and his sidekick andy pettitte into great shape has been encouraged to sing against his old pal bonds and clemens also seem to have learned the lesson of bigtime sports , which is that athletes tend to feel they are above the standards of ordinary citizens this ambiguous verdict on bonds comes six years after a congressional hearing at which mcgwire of whether he had used illegal steroids or another disreputable substitute he has but only for health and recuperation , never for an edge and has to being voted into the hall of fame on wednesday evening , commissioner bud selig released a statement praising baseball s rules and testing for drugs but referring only obliquely to allegations about the conduct of former players this was no allegation this was a conviction of the career home run leader for obstruction of justice major league baseball will have to deal with it barring some further ruling , both bonds and clemens become eligible for the hall after the 2012 season , when they will have been retired five seasons they must receive 75 percent of the votes from certified baseball writers with that mixed decision on wednesday , barry bonds s career may be judged by the testimony of a friend with tears in her eyes , who said she saw him injected by his trainer one needle , one count , one reputation
one of the great tropes of republican criticism of is that the president goes around the world apologizing for america s past misdeeds have we ever had a president , asked in a foreign policy speech this summer , who was so eager to address the world with an apology on his lips and doubt in his heart \? mr romney repeated the allegation at last month s national security debate he even embedded his claim in the title of his campaign book no apology believe in america the implicit allegation is that mr obama does not , at bottom , believe in america , and so ca n't be trusted to stand up for american values or interests absurd as this sounds , the charge seems to have put the white house on the defensive according to news reports , one reason mr obama decided not to apologize to pakistan for the deaths of 24 soldiers in a airstrike along pakistan s border last month is that doing so would give the president s political opponents further ammunition against him let s start with the question of whether mr obama has , in fact , apologized in a series of speeches at the start of his tenure , the president acknowledged mistakes made by his predecessor , which of course counts not as apology but as standard political critique but also some that lay deeper in the past and were more systematic in cairo , for example , he admitted that the united states played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected iranian government that of mohammed mossadegh in 1953 at the united nations he acknowledged that the united states had dragged its feet on  do these and similar statements constitute apologies \? more important , would it be bad if they did \? presidential apologies , or those delivered by senior government officials , are not unprecedented in a major speech in cairo in 2005 , , then mr bush s secretary of state , said that for 60 years , my country , the united states , pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the middle east and we achieved neither what was she doing if not apologizing on behalf of the united states and vowing to put an end to a pattern of misguided policy \? what s wrong with apologizing for misdeeds anyway \? we applaud german leaders for apologizing for the holocaust it s clear that japan could put its relations with china on a better footing by apologizing for the 1937 rape of nanjing , but japanese leaders resolutely refuse the idea that real patriots do n't apologize is as absurd , and as common , as the idea that real men do n't apologize \( maybe it s only women who have the strength of character to do so \) but the word apology has become so politicized in our own discourse that no president can admit to doing it ben rhodes , a senior white house official , was responsible for many of the phrases that mr romney and others scorn as national selfflagellation when i asked mr rhodes about the republican claim , he said indignantly , barack obama has never apologized though he noted that both and george w bush had in mr obama s cairo speech , for example , mr rhodes explained that the president was merely acknowledging the history between the united states and iran well , yes , but he was also saying that the united states had done wrong there are many reasons to apologize , whether on your own behalf or your nation s perhaps the most important is to put the past to rest in order to move on history is often tragic , mr obama said in turkey , but unresolved , it can be a heavy weight and reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future he had just finished talking about america s legacy of slavery and discrimination , and was pivoting to turkey s need to come to terms with the terrible events of 1915 the \( not that mr obama used that terribly freighted word \) mr obama suggested that turkey needed to confront its mistreatment of minorities , as the united states has done , to achieve justice today but mr obama s conservative critics are n't really contesting his interpretation of the past none of them have stood up for slavery , or claimed the united states had nothing to do with overthrowing mr mossadegh what they object to is mr obama s moral universe in a 2009 wall street journal article that gave birth to the apology trope , karl rove , the republican mastermind , wrote that mr obama makes it seem as though there is moral equivalence between america and its adversaries mr bush divided the world into good and evil , our side and their side ronald reagan did the same during the cold war that s moral clarity , and mr obama apparently does n't have it , the hardest of the foreign policy hardliners among the republican candidates , said in a speech that in iran we sided with evil because our president believes our enemies are legitimately aggrieved and thus we have no standing to intervene this is a preposterous claim still , let s give it slightly more dignity than it deserves perhaps we should say that mr obama and his critics disagree about america s place in history mr romney insists that he believes passionately in american exceptionalism , by which he means that america is the greatest nation in the history of the world and a force for good mr obama allegedly does not but mr rhodes says that mr obama simply has a different view of the subject at the center of his political identity , mr rhodes says , is the understanding that america is constantly in pursuit of a more perfect union acknowledging past mistakes is thus an act of affirmation , not of shamefacedness whether that will fly on the campaign trail in the current atmosphere of national aggravation is another question republicans have made a lot of recent hay accusing democrats of not being trueblue americans at bottom the apology trope and republican exploitation of it arises not from metaphysical principles or historical interpretation , but from politics having killed osama bin laden and wound down the wars in and iraq , the president is not terribly vulnerable on foreign policy the goal of critics is thus to discredit mr obama himself if mr obama does not believe in america , how can any of his policies be trusted \? the candidates and the polemicists never say , and perhaps do not need to say , what many conservatives actually feel about this halfblack , hawaiianindonesian president that he belongs to the world of foreigners , not americans of course he s apologizing to them we have been here before , though not with such an ugly undertone the last democratic president who sought to remake america s image in the world was jimmy carter in a 1977 speech at the university of notre dame announcing his new human rights policy , mr carter famously spoke of an inordinate fear of communism which once led us to embrace any dictator who joined us in that fear like mr obama and ms rice mr carter felt that he needed to acknowledge the past in order to clear the way for a different kind of policy and , like mr obama , he was attacked for gross na vet hendrik hertzberg , the new yorker writer who was then a carter speechwriter , recalls that one very unpleasant consequence of the speech was that it energized the neoconservative movement ronald reagan went to town on mr carter s qualms , as mr obama s rivals hope to do today but the carter example prompts a different kind of troubling reflection mr carter really did prove to be na ve when the soviets invaded afghanistan , he admitted that he had been wrong about them while his human rights policy succeeded in one very important respect it gave heart to many people living under dictatorship it never persuaded any dictator to leave peacefully , nor led to reforms within dictatorships mr obama , too , has little to show for his everperfectingunion rhetoric neither israel nor the have taken him up on his invitation to acknowledge the legitimacy of the other s aspirations tehran , indifferent to his blandishments , has forged ahead with its nuclear program though there is merit to white house officials' claim that only by offering an open hand to iran , and having it slapped away , was mr obama able to persuade other nations to join the united states in imposing increasingly tough sanctions on the government an apology or a whatever is , in the end , a type of rhetoric , not of action and rhetoric may matter more to us than to those we seek to address

london the existence of the bad sex in fiction award immediately raises the question , why not a good sex in fiction award \? what on earth would you do that for \? asked john walsh , a columnist at the independent , who was in the crowd on tuesday night for this year s prize good sex is like good driving it s the absence of things going wrong , and it is an extraordinarily boring thing to write about also , this is england , where sex is somehow funny anyway , and where people appreciate the agony of embarrassment much more than the thrill of achievement , at least when it happens to someone else there s nothing the english love more than a good literary joke against someone who is well known , said rachel johnson , editor of the lady magazine she , for a scene in her novel shire hell , in which the narrator lies back during lovemaking and thinks of slug extermination what s so funny is that when i got the manuscript back from my american publisher , the editor had put a big tick in the margin and written the word perfect , ' ms johnson said of her winning entry this was the exact passage that in england won me the bad sex prize it was in search of similar courageous efforts that a crowd of writers , publishers , seasoned partygoers and hangerson , as well as the philosopher a c grayling , gathered to hear a pair of volunteers try to remain calm while reading racy excerpts from the offending nominees , and to find out the winner even the location was a double entendre the in and out club in central london the host was the writer alexander waugh , the grandson of evelyn waugh and the son of auberon waugh , who was editor of the in 1993 when the magazine first sponsored the prize the idea was to draw attention to the crude , tasteless , often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel , and to discourage it we hoped no one would be writing this rubbish any more , but this prize has spectacularly backfired , said mr waugh from the stage straying from the matter at hand , he spontaneously treated the audience to a limerick about a man from kildare who has sex on the stairs judging from this year s 12 nominated books , including ones by lee child , david guterson and stephen king , bad sex is alive and vigorous , sometimes frighteningly so the books' sexually active protagonists are compared , among other things , to wakening beasts , lightning rods , outrageous sea creatures and the midnight train they are panting fast and hard , and long and slow they are sniffing , heaving , kneading , rubbing , pinching , flicking , biting , burrowing , darting , plunging , thrusting , bucking , shuddering , shivering , trembling , swelling and convulsing and they are wondering , in the case of one character had the erection continued the whole time he was sleeping \?

waltham , mass the wait for has been equal parts exasperation and helplessness his will he or wo n't he \? status has been a continuing and dominant topic for the for the better part of a month it was again thursday as the celtics convened for their first practice session since falling behind , 20 , to the in the coach finally could say he anticipated that o'neal would play when the series resumes saturday night at td garden we 're not going to let him do too much , rivers said someone will ask how much is too much \? i do n't know what too much is walking on the floor could be too much we 'll figure that out rivers did say that o'neal would not start the , he was returning from a strained right achilles' tendon , which had kept him out for more than two months he played a spirited five and a half minutes , delighting the crowd and his teammates , before he came up limping with what the team said was a strained right calf even after the april 3 injury , the team hoped o'neal would be ready for the playoffs but before the start of their series against the knicks , the celtics said o'neal failed a basic running drill and would be out indefinitely he missed all four games of that series and the first two in miami o'neal , 39 , missed a careerhigh 45 games this season , his first with the celtics after signing as a free agent over the summer all of the missed games were a result of injuries to his right leg asked how o'neal , listed at 7 feet 1 and 325 pounds , might affect the game , rivers said he 'll be big at the end of the day , he 'll be big o'neal s availability for game 3 hinges on his being able to make it through practice friday and whatever pregame session the team has saturday he was not available for interviews thursday while o'neal s return could provide an emotional boost , the strong likelihood is that he will play limited minutes it falls on the starters , the ones likely to play 35 to 40 minutes , to turn around the series rivers said that paul pierce \( strained left achilles' \) , rajon rondo \( sore back \) and ray allen \( sore chest \) were better after some game 2 bumps and bruises the celtics spent most of their time thursday going over film from the first two games , a loss in game 1 and a loss in game 2 rivers found many areas of concern , but none that he said could not be corrected still , he knows that fixing the errors may not be enough you have to deal with the fact that they have great confidence , he said of the heat we gave it to them rivers talked about the need to stay composed , avoiding what he called mental hijackings he said the heat played harder in the first two games , finished stronger at the basket and attempted 68 free throws to the celtics' 40 , even though boston was called for only five more fouls kevin garnett took no free throws over 74 minutes in the two games they beat us we tip our hats to them , said allen , the only starter made available to reporters thursday they did what they set out to do we do n't like the way we played in either game we have to rectify that asked what he thought was most important , allen echoed a party line just be more on the attack it seems like they attacked us all day long offensively , we have to attack more and then take that easy stuff away the celtics also need to tighten up defensively they allowed the fewest points per game in the nba regular season , 911 miami is averaging 1005 the celtics were no 5 in 3point field goal defense at 34 percent miami is making 457 percent of its 3pointers miami is also shooting 462 percent as a team celtics opponents shot 434 percent during the regular season but on top of rivers s todo list is , simply , to win the celtics probably need to win games 3 and 4 otherwise they would be in a 31 hole with the prospect of winning twice in miami but they have to start with saturday the heat has never lost a playoff series in which it led by 20 but the heat knows that being up by 20 is no guarantee miami trailed the dallas mavericks , 20 , in the 2006 nba finals and won the series in six games the 1969 celtics rallied from a 20 deficit in the nba finals to beat the los angeles lakers in seven games seven other celtics teams have faced a 20 deficit in a bestofseven series all lost , and three were swept
pedro beato vividly recalls the day he arrived in new york city from his native dominican republic it was kind of a rainy day , i remember , he said i was 13 well , i was 12 and i was turning 13 the next month beato and his family settled in woodside , queens , a long toss from shea stadium , where his adopted hometown team , the , played his family would later move to ridgewood , on the queensbrooklyn border , and he attended xaverian high school in brooklyn beato eventually grew accustomed to the city but not without some growing pains and culture shock it was like being reborn again , he said the whole living is just different in the dr , you wake up , eat something , then you go play in the street here you ca n't really do that it s more like an isolated kind of thing beato , 24 , has plenty of company now he has been thrust into a closerbycommittee role with the mets , along with and bobby parnell , after the trade that sent francisco rodriguez to milwaukee last week i think i'm ready , beato said it s something new at this level , but it s not something new i did it last year , so we 'll see how it goes beato , a 6foot4 , 220pound righthanded rookie who came over from the orioles' minor league system in the rule 5 draft in the offseason , first captured the attention of manager terry collins in spring training , when collins said he saw beato as a possible closer in the future beato parlayed the strong spring into a franchiserecord 182 3 scoreless innings to begin his career , and after a stint on the disabled list with elbow tendinitis and some struggles , he has regained his form he entered sunday s game against philadelphia having allowed three earned runs in 122 3 innings since june 8 against the phillies on sunday , he walked three and allowed three unearned runs in twothirds of an inning he is now 21 with a 332 earned run average over 402 3 innings in 32 appearances this season collins said beato needed to improve his consistency in order to become a primary closer we 've seen out of pedro where he s pitched a couple nights in a row , and a lot of times the third night or the day off all of a sudden his fastball is n't what it quite was , collins said it needs to be as a closer you need to have that durable arm to bounce back , so we 'll see how he handles it there may be some questions about his durability , but there are none about his stuff the mets' pitching coach , dan warthen , said beato s repertory , which includes a 94milesperhour fastball , a sinker in the low 90s and a curveball in the low 80s , made him a viable candidate to close he s got good action on all his pitches , warthen said he s got a strikeout pitch he s got a groundball pitch beato arrived in queens from the dominican republic with plenty of baseball experience he played in various leagues growing up , including a travel team that went to venezuela for international tournaments , but most of the time he was behind the plate i used to play catcher until i came here and i was like 510 , beato said he said he decided i'm not going to catch anymore it s not going to be for me' then i stuck to pitching i was more consistent as a pitcher than a hitter he said scouts became interested in him as a pitcher when he was 15 and his velocity was reaching 87 mph some of the interest waned when he injured his shoulder and needed tommy john surgery during his junior year at xaverian it was tough not only because i was scared , but having surgery that young is pretty rare , he said beato returned for his senior year and was impressive enough that the mets drafted him in the 17th round in 2005 beato said his pitches were reaching 95 mph the summer he was drafted , but he said the mets were skeptical because of his injury history he decided to attend st petersburg college in florida instead of signing with the mets and possibly beginning his professional career with the class a brooklyn cyclones on the same coney island field where he had played games in high school he chose st petersburg , a twoyear college , so he could be eligible for the draft again in 2006 he enjoyed a successful season at st petersburg and was drafted in the first round in 2006 32nd over all by the orioles , and began his professional career at the age of 19 after showing glimpses of potential in 2006 with a 363 era in 14 appearances 10 starts in low class a , beato participated in the futures game and was named a top100 prospect by baseball america in 2007 then beato began to struggle his era over the next three seasons was 552 , 585 and 452 yet , he reached class aa bowie at the end of 2009 and his career underwent a resurgence in 2010 when he moved to the bullpen beato went 40 with a 211 era for bowie that season , striking out 50 against 14 walks in 592 3 innings he also closed for the first time in his professional career , saving 16 games for me it was a change for the best , he said of his becoming a reliever the results have shown that it was a lot better for me to come out of the bullpen than to be a starter the pitching coach just spoke to me , and the minor league coordinator when i was with the orioles told me i 'd get to the big leagues quicker that way the orioles were right , but the mets are the ones enjoying the results after moving to the bullpen , it took beato just one season to reach the majors , and because he was selected in the rule 5 draft in december , beato is guaranteed to avoid demotion this season now he is auditioning for an opportunity to cement his place in the mets' closing committee and call queens home again for the foreseeable future it s a lot more aggressive , it s a lot more exciting , beato said , referring to the closer s job it might be a little difficult , but we 've all just go to do our jobs
early one morning , 50 years ago today , while his wife , mary , slept upstairs , ernest hemingway went into the vestibule of his ketchum , idaho , house , selected his favorite shotgun from the rack , inserted shells into its chambers and ended his life there were many differing explanations at the time that he had terminal cancer or money problems , that it was an accident , that he 'd quarreled with mary none were true as his friends knew , he 'd been suffering from depression and paranoia for the last year of his life ernest and i were friends for 14 years i dramatized many of his stories and novels for television specials and film , and we shared adventures in france , italy , cuba and spain , where , as a pretend matador with ernest as my manager , i participated in a ciudad real bullfight ernest s zest for life was infectious in 1959 ernest had a contract with life magazine to write about spain s reigning matadors , the brothersinlaw antonio ord ez and luis miguel domingu n he cabled me , urging me to join him for the tour it was a glorious summer , and we celebrated ernest s 60th birthday with a party that lasted two days but i remember it now as the last of the good times in may 1960 , ernest phoned me from cuba he was uncharacteristically perturbed that the unfinished life article had reached 92 , 453 words the contract was for 40 , 000 he was having nightmares a month later he called again he had cut only 530 words , he was exhausted and would it be an imposition to ask me to come to cuba to help him \? i did , and over the next nine days i submitted list upon list of suggested cuts at first he rejected them what i 've written is proustian in its cumulative effect , and if we eliminate detail we destroy that effect but eventually he grudgingly consented to cutting 54 , 916 words he was resigned , surrendering , and said he would leave it to life to cut the rest i got on the plane back to new york knowing my friend was bonetired and very beatup , but thinking he simply needed rest and would soon be his old dominating self again in november i went out west for our annual pheasant shoot and realized how wrong i was when ernest and our friend duke macmullen met my train at shoshone , idaho , for the drive to ketchum , we did not stop at the bar opposite the station as we usually did because ernest was anxious to get on the road i asked why the hurry the feds what \? they tailed us all the way ask duke well there was a car back of us out of hailey why are fbi agents pursuing you \? i asked it s the worst hell the goddamnedest hell they 've bugged everything that s why we 're using duke s car mine s bugged everything s bugged ca n't use the phone mail intercepted we rode for miles in silence as we turned into ketchum , ernest said quietly duke , pull over cut your lights he peered across the street at a bank two men were working inside what is it \? i asked auditors the fbi s got them going over my account but how do you know \? why would two auditors be working in the middle of the night \? of course it s my account all his friends were worried he had changed he was depressed he would n't hunt he looked bad ernest , mary and i went to dinner the night before i left halfway through the meal ernest said we had to leave immediately mary asked what was wrong those two fbi agents at the bar , that s what s wrong the next day mary had a private talk with me she was terribly distraught ernest spent hours every day with the manuscript of his paris sketches published as a moveable feast after his death trying to write but unable to do more than turn its pages he often spoke of destroying himself and would sometimes stand at the gun rack , holding one of the guns , staring out the window on nov 30 he was registered under an assumed name in the psychiatric section of st mary s hospital in rochester , minn , where , during december , he was given 11 electric shock treatments in january he called me from outside his room he sounded in control , but his voice held a heartiness that did n't belong there and his delusions had not changed or diminished his room was bugged , and the phone was tapped he suspected that one of the interns was a fed during a short release he twice attempted suicide with a gun from the vestibule rack and on a flight to the mayo clinic , though heavily sedated , he tried to jump from the plane when it stopped in casper , wyo , for repairs , he tried to walk into the moving propeller i visited him in june he had been given a new series of shock treatments , but it was as before the car bugged , his room bugged i said it very gently papa , why do you want to kill yourself \? what do you think happens to a man going on 62 when he realizes that he can never write the books and stories he promised himself \? or do any of the other things he promised himself in the good days \? but how can you say that \? you have written a beautiful book about paris , as beautiful as anyone can hope to write the best of that i wrote before and now i ca n't finish it i told him to relax or even retire retire \? he said unlike your baseball player and your prizefighter and your matador , how does a writer retire \? no one accepts that his legs are shot or the whiplash gone from his reflexes everywhere he goes , he hears the same damn question what are you working on \? i told him he never cared about those dumb questions what does a man care about \? staying healthy working good eating and drinking with his friends enjoying himself in bed i have n't any of them you understand , goddamn it \? none of them then he turned on me i was just like the others , pumping him for information and selling him out to the feds after that day , i never saw him again this man , who had stood his ground against charging water buffaloes , who had flown missions over germany , who had refused to accept the prevailing style of writing but , enduring rejection and poverty , had insisted on writing in his own unique way , this man , my deepest friend , was afraid afraid that the fbi was after him , that his body was disintegrating , that his friends had turned on him , that living was no longer an option decades later , in response to a freedom of information petition , the fbi released its hemingway file it revealed that beginning in the 1940s j edgar hoover had placed ernest under surveillance because he was suspicious of ernest s activities in cuba over the following years , agents filed reports on him and tapped his phones the surveillance continued all through his confinement at st mary s hospital it is likely that the phone outside his room was tapped after all in the years since , i have tried to reconcile ernest s fear of the fbi , which i regretfully misjudged , with the reality of the fbi file i now believe he truly sensed the surveillance , and that it substantially contributed to his anguish and his suicide i was in rome the day he died i did not go to ketchum for the funeral instead i went to santa maria sopra minerva , one of his favorite churches , and said goodbye to him there i recalled a favorite dictum of his man can be destroyed , but not defeated

results from a watershed presidential election in began to trickle in sunday after the voting unfolded peacefully the day before a first for a country with a history of rigged and violent votes in the 12 years since the end of military rule nigerians have never voted before in such favorable conditions , analysts and election monitors said ballot materials appear to have arrived on time , there were few reports of violence and the registration process before the voting on saturday appeared to have gone smoothly the implications of the clean vote , for a new democracy still struggling to establish itself after years of dictatorship , are big analysts noted that the winner would most likely have a legitimacy denied to his predecessors elected under murky circumstances , including ballot stealing , a fraudulent polling list and the violent intimidation of voters , all features of the last presidential election , the widely denounced 2007 vote none of those flaws appeared to be a significant part of the electoral landscape on saturday it appears to be going quite smoothly , said the leader of the national democratic institute s observer mission , joe clark , a former canadian prime minister , speaking from the nigerian capital , abuja it s gone in a quite orderly fashion , he said , as large numbers of voters waited patiently their numbers were called , and they queued up compared with earlier years , relatively few people , about 39 , were killed in preelection violence , according to the election situation room , a nigerian civil society group there have been several bomb blasts as well , notably in the north , home to a militant islamic sect but the systematic manipulation that plagued previous elections appeared to be absent , experts said on saturday , electoral officials were using an uncomplicated procedure for cutting down on fraud , mr clark said they were asking voters to remain near the polling places their simple presence is supposed to deter what happened before , he said the reason they are staying is to protect their vote their watchful eyes are credited with deterring fraud and their numbers are seen as preventing intimidation of voters and poll workers in addition , the incumbent president , goodluck jonathan , is considered a credible candidate who is almost certain to be the eventual winner , although he could face a runoff he has repeatedly called on his supporters to refrain from intimidation and acts of violence further , mr jonathan s main opponent , muhammadu buhari , said saturday that he would not contest the results of the vote nigeria , which is america s fourth biggest supplier of crude oil , africa s most populous country and home to major investments by american energy companies , is considered by the united states to be one of the two most important countries in subsaharan africa , assistant secretary of state johnnie carson said in a conference call with reporters from nigeria and elsewhere last month the other major country usually cited is south africa this year s election was being closely watched by american officials because , despite shaking off military rule in 1999 , nigeria has maintained an ambiguous , lessthandemocratic status , undermined by largescale corruption , fraud and an elections agency that appeared to increase rather than combat those flaws even more than the outcome , with mr jonathan s victory largely assumed , the process has been under scrutiny already , with mr jonathan s appointment of a respected political scientist , attahiru jega , last year to run the independent national electoral commission , a will to reform appeared evident mr jega has received high marks for the expeditious cleaning of a voter list that included thousands of illegitimate names of dead people and celebrities using a computer registration system deployed at thousands of polling places in the vast country of 150 million , and taking electronic fingerprints of every voter already , before saturday s vote , the parliamentary elections last week were peaceful and credible in most parts of the country , said peter lewis , a nigeria expert at johns hopkins university this is the first poll they 've had under a civilian administration where they 've had a reasonable degree of organization , mr lewis said nigerian analysts concurred at this stage we 're satisfied so far , said clement nwankwo , the executive director of the policy and legal advocacy center in abuja for a lot of nigerians it was really a relief to see the elections go as peacefully as they did last saturday mr jonathan , a 53yearold former university zoologist who was the vice president , inherited the presidency a year ago when the incumbent , umaru yar'adua , died but mr jonathan s candidacy is not without handicaps he is mildmannered , and as a christian from the south is resented by many in the muslim north as an interloper in an accepted tradition according to which northerners and southerners alternate in holding the presidency mr jonathan s party lost ground in the parliamentary elections last week , and the speaker of the house was defeated the party seems certain to have a diminished majority , and it may even be forced into a coalition , when all the results are tallied but he is also the candidate of the dominant people s democratic party , which has an organization in every corner of nigeria , which is the size of california , nevada and arizona , and has won every presidential election since the return to civilian rule in 1999 he has promised to overhaul the country s feeble electric system , which produces less power than the output of a midsize american city blackouts are frequent all over the country his appointment of mr jega has been seen as a plus , and as a southerner he has brought provisional calm and a return to the production of oil to restive south nigeria , which was for years gripped by a militant insurgency that used the region s neglect by abuja as an excuse to blow up pipelines and kidnap foreign oil workers mr jonathan , a native of the oilproducing region , has made the region a prime focus in his brief tenure government corruption , however , remains endemic mr buhari , 69 , his main challenger , is a former military dictator , a muslim from the north and a popular figure in that region mr buhari s brief reign from 1983 to 1985 he was himself overthrown in a military coup was marked by an anticorruption campaign and the execution of drug traffickers defeated in two previous attempts , his main appeal is his stance against corruption but his rule included severe repression of civil liberties , and that has not been forgotten
what would western civilization have been like had it worshiped not a single , remote , male god , but two or more vividly present divine beings of both genders \? would we now have a kinder , gentler and more balanced society \? maybe not , but if the visual culture of india is any indicator , our art of the past thousand years might have been sexier mother india the goddess in indian painting , a small exhibition at the metropolitan museum of art , gathers together about 40 sculptures , paintings and drawings representing , the great mother goddess of india , whose cult dates back at least 3 , 000 years and who is now thought to be the most popular of all indian deities organized by john guy and kurt behrendt , curators of asian art at the met , the show could be a teaser for a much more expansive exhibition it also is oddly misnamed in that it displays more sculpture than painting nevertheless , the selection of works , all from the museum s collection and dating from the first millennium bc to 1990 , includes pieces of exceptional beauty and it affords a fine occasion to ponder the meaning of the feminine in indian art and myth this goddess is usually pictured unabashedly as a figure of much erotic appeal some representations border on pornography a small enough to hold in your hand represents a supine woman with cartoonishly big breasts , narrow waist and legs spread wide to present her naked pudenda a giant lotus blossom covering her head associates the image with fertility this expression of the concept of the female body as the embodiment of lifeaffirming forces is perhaps the most extreme in indian iconography , the museum label notes rather dryly in most other cases , however , the goddess is no merely passive object for lubricious meditation thirteen of the most compelling pieces in the exhibition represent , the warrior aspect of devi she is naked except for a heavy belt around her hips and lots of jewelry , but with as many as 20 arms holding various weapons and talismans , she is ready to rumble her equivalent in modern culture could be the incredibly athletic and resourceful cia operative played by angelina jolie in salt the best piece in the show is a small , 12thcentury argillite sculpture called it represents a 16armed durga slaying her most fearsome opponent with a trident after he emerges from the lopped neck of his buffalo disguise this kinetically charged composition , carved in extraordinarily refined detail , is a marvel of formal and metaphorical concentration it is easy to believe the museum label , which says it is one of the finest examples of indian miniature sculpture in the met s collection durga s epic story is more fully illustrated in the show s drawings , which detail the cast of characters with wonderful precision in a preparatory from 1780 , durga , astride her big cat , and kali , the hideous goddess of death , approach a motley crew of demons , each a comical hybrid of human and bestial features \( kali , who is an aspect of durga , is pictured in the exhibition s most recent piece , a 1990 by y g srimati , wearing her customary skirt made of human skulls \) this is the stuff of a great , oldtime hollywood or bollywood spectacular to grasp what is at stake in the conflict between , it helps to do some background reading versions of the story vary , but basically it begins with the mahishasura running around the universe causing havoc just for fun none of the great male gods could rein him in but from the bodies of vishnu , brahma and five others emerged seven shaktis , female spirits who merged into the one indomitable durga , personification of all nature armed with weapons donated by the gods , durga mounted a lion and set out to do battle with mahishasura for his part he was smitten and wanted to marry her much to his annoyance , she refused he sent hundreds of thousands of his demon soldiers to defeat her , but she killed them all and drank their blood he went after her himself in different animal guises , until finally she decapitated his buffalo form and stabbed him to death when he came out of the beast s neck how might this ancient , fantastic saga speak to a modern audience \? we might think of the buffalo demon and his troublemaking cohort as representing the hubris of men who have sought over the centuries to dominate and exploit the natural world using scientific and technological ingenuity in this effort , they have also brought about a great imbalance in the collective consciousness of humankind not to be trifled with , nature will put things right one way or another , and not always prettily famine , pestilence , melting ice caps and other catastrophes wrought by kali will be visited on the disrespectful indian mythology envisions all this as a conflict between the masculine and the feminine if you think of it as a tension between conventionally gendered states of mind between compartmentalizing , instrumental reason and organic , holistic intuition it makes good sense the gods and goddesses , after all , are us
events in hiphop feel smaller than they used to this is the age of the regional hit , the nobudget viral video , the twitter star hiphop , so long the most vibrant force in pop music , could always be counted on for big spending , a boon to producers , directors , fashion stylists , car dealers and so on , to say nothing of the marketing specialists , brand synergists and secondary industries it fueled but in recent years the center has been weakening , and the genre is readjusting to life built from the bottom up jayz and kanye west are fromthetopdown guys , though oldfashioned oligarchs , the last of a dying breed there are younger stars who have their sort of dominance on their mind lil wayne and drake primarily but the landscape they have to navigate does n't favor the lengthy reigns of old , especially when the entrenched powers refuse to cede any ground still , by all measurements , 2011 is perhaps the worst time for jayz and mr west to release their first collaborative album , watch the throne \( rocafella def jam roc nation \) this is an album that announces its importance well before it appears , a teamup of titans not given to sharing the spotlight from a distance it s a final burst of hiphop hubris , the last gasp of the late1990s to mid'00s insistence on hugeness , a howitzer at the door but up close watch the throne is none of those things it forsakes the epic for the idiosyncratic , it tempers its bombast with both reflection and inventiveness it s not the brobdingnagian affair it could have been , and is better for it restraint is n't quite the word this is a full , complex and not shy record instead , what s on display is curiosity and risk curiosity and risk are often byproducts of privilege , of course , and many of the aesthetic choices on watch the throne derive directly from the circumstances of its creation the songs were developed in three bursts across several months and continents , creating a range of moods and tones as a whole it s not totally legible there are too many ideas , as if jayz and mr west \( billed as the throne for this project \) were auditioning several new styles but forgot to choose one but watch the throne is an album with several phenomenal moments , even if it does n't quite add up to a phenomenal album in this union the unflappable jayz has given in ever so slightly to the restless mr west both sound hungry and probing and , most important , not complacent , making watch the throne perhaps the most ambitious and effortful latecareer album hiphop has ever seen this is the least obviously commercial album mr west has ever made as for jayz it rivals some of his recent artistic disappointments , failures of shortsightedness , not ambition jayz , 41 , and mr west , 34 , have appeared on several songs together in recent years , but their most intimate collaboration remains jayz s 2001 album the blueprint , for which mr west , then just a producer , contributed four songs in the years since , they 've developed a reliable mentorstudent relationship jayz carves out new territory for a rapper , then mr west tests its boundaries , often breaking through them still , when they rap together , mr west often willingly plays the junior member of the partnership , while jayz is reluctant to sacrifice even an inch of his authority , even as mr west has become a peer and maybe more for all the ego involved , watch the throne is shockingly amiable there s no competition on display it reveals less about the relationship between mr west and jayz than the minor disagreements that popped up in the press in the weeks before this album s release they may not always see eye to eye , but watch the throne almost never suggests they have incompatible agendas they 're simpatico right down to the fine points several tracks feature the two rapping back and forth , epmd style , a true duo the closer , why i love you , plays as an update of coming of age , the hustler education lesson from jayz s 1996 debut , reasonable doubt replacing the na f memphis bleek , though , there s mr west , not just a prot g but a partner , sympathizing with jayz as he laments how his old students failed to hold the fort jayz has always been a good leader if not a great manager he s sharper in company he deems worthy if he frets about anything on this album , it s the increasingly rarefied air he breathes , and the particular stresses that come with occupying those spaces as a black man why all the pretty icons always all white \? he asks on that s my bitch put some colored girls in the moma on murder to excellence he s more blunt only spot a few blacks the higher i go what s up to will , shoutout to o and to mr west as well , who responds tartly we like the promised land of the og s in the past if you picture events like a black tie what s the last thing you expect to see \? black guys but mr west and jayz have transcended all that , necessitating a hiphop category beyond street money , beyond new money they 're quick absorbers and have been quickly assimilated , mr west more so , thanks to the trail jayz left for him the signifiers are n't jewelry and cars though jayz raps about his hublot watch and mr west talks about his 1985 white lamborghini countach two of 'em but high fashion and high art basquiats , warhols serving as my muses my house like a museum , jayz raps on a bonus track usually you have this much taste , you european that s the end of that way of thinking \( mr west , as usual , gets to the point more quickly what s that jacket margiela \? \) for jayz breaking these old barriers is a means to acceptance and stability it s as if he were building a home in a new neighborhood and does n't want his credentials doubted by contrast mr west sounds lonely fame has n't done much but place him in a wolves' den sunglasses and advil last night was mad real , he mopes on no church in the wild for mr west every flash of dionysian extreme is tempered by the realization of its hollowness in the mirror where i see my only enemy , he raps on the joy , your life s cursed \? well , mine s an obscenity most of jayz s pain here is deeply ingrained on welcome to the jungle he details the family deaths that nearly undid him on the joy he laments , i seen so much as a kid , they surprised i do n't needle pop both rappers have effectively mined the darker corners of their biographies for great music before , but it s stirring to hear them do side by side the first half of murder to excellence is among the most explicitly political music either has made most vivid is new day , the album s melancholy center , with both men addressing their unborn children here , as elsewhere , jayz is taut mr west is expansive i 'll never let my son have an ego he 'll be nice to everyone wherever we go i mean , i might even make him be republican so everybody know he love white people making relevant socially themed songs in an age of financial and political unrest is a challenge these two artists at least pay lip service to like a charitable donation , it s a combination of maturity and duty but the real tests on watch the throne are musical , not conceptual the scattered nature of this album s creation is evident most in the production , which can be roughly segmented into three categories there are the southerninflected tracks , which are the most obvious concessions to modern hit making , and which are curiously few here just h a m , produced by lex luger , and two of the album s highlights , both with unprintable titles , produced by hitboy and southside \( mr west also receives production credit on almost every song \) there are the moody and harsh numbers like the dubstepinfluenced who gon stop me , and the tv on the radioesque why i love you and then there s the nostalgia that creeps over much of this album , giving it a sonic throughline and mission statement on the gloomy new day , produced with the rza , both men borrow the me and the rza connect line from raekwon s 1995 connoisseur classic incarcerated scarfaces otis is built , rather straightforwardly , around a sample of otis redding s try a little tenderness , and the joy , a bonus track , relies heavily on curtis mayfield s making of you \( live \) the no idproduced primetime has the scratchiness of the mid'90s , and the loose and frenzied that s my bitch moves with the swagger of an old diamond d production , with mr west evoking slick rick and jayz chubb rock on a technical level jayz has n't pushed himself this much in years in places he s too reliant on the stopstart flow he s honed of late , but mostly he s digging around in the corner of his toolbox , looking for underused patterns and cadences to revive that s a victory for art on an album whose success will be determined , at least initially , by its size watch the throne was released on itunes on monday , and will be released on cd in best buy on friday , arriving in other stores later this month , the better to stem any financial losses from piracy , and also an attempt to consolidate the reception of the album this is an oldguard way of addressing new times , hoping to impose order on an environment that is intrinsically fractured but that s consistent with how mr west and jayz approached the making of this album , large chunks of which were actually recorded in hotels , which are then often rapped about \( maybe the mercer hotel and the tribeca grand will offer watch the throne suites for hiphop tourists \) there s no sense of place on watch the throne beyond a global here and now the two men travel across time zones and locations , and squeeze out bursts of creativity before toweling off and making for the next spot the album artwork is by riccardo tisci , the givenchy designer , but there are references in the lyrics to yc s racks and waka flocka flame s bustin at em , recent atlanta rap anthems even some of the sample choices recent tracks by the house music veterans cassius and the dubstep comer flux pavilion are songs probably heard overseas and quickly tweaked for the purposes of watch the throne , but it also features frank ocean , the rising rb star the foreign lives alongside the familiar furthermore , a close reading of the liner notes reveals gems impossibletonotice vocals by seal \( why \? \) on lift off , snippets from the will ferrell ice skating comedy blades of glory , freelance opera singers , a moving sample from the indiggo twins , america s got talent punching bags and , as described here , ambassadors of the great romanian tradition \( which \? \) this is n't excess for excess s sake it s the state of being so rich you forgot where you put all your nice things , being so rich you lost sight of which stuff is actually nice and which stuff you bought just because you 're used to buying things meaningful references the abundant james brown samples , the use of redding and mayfield are all jumbled with irrelevant ones but that confusion is a sort of victory here instead of a monolithic mandate delivered from on high , watch the throne delivers something more splintered and haphazard , a legitimate engagement with what it means to be new , in the now it s a small record by big men with nothing to lose but bigness itself
saratoga springs , ny the horses look like shadows at dawn as they cross union avenue , stopping traffic to shuttle between the saratoga race course on the west side of the street and a timeless oasis on its east side the oklahoma training track think of it as a club med for horsemen who prefer spending their working vacation with their own kind  it was here that saratoga s first meeting was held in 1863 , a fourday racing festival where horseplayers bet with bookies and watched from their carriages the oklahoma is treelined and perpetually shady , as are the original boardandbatten barns elegantly splintered that form clusters of villages around its perimeter , too , save for the geese honking from its infield and the headclearing snorts of racehorses circling the track sunshine finally shines on the united nations of horsemen represented here jockey eddie castro carries on an animated conversation in spanish with two exercise riders as three clipclop their horses along a wooded trail leading to the racetrack s gap for workouts there , christophe clement , a frenchman , offers instructions to a brigade of riders in his native language irish brogues and queen s english echo in the stillness the hall of fame trainer was on horseback wednesday morning , sitting tall in the saddle , his black leather vest and chaps flapping as the wind blew a cool breath on an alreadypleasant 68degree morning he was leading a set of horses out for morning gallops but was in no hurry to put them through their paces lukas was off to a slow start here , managing a single victory in 30 starts he stopped at the sight of a fellow hall of fame trainer , , who was leaning against the rail at the clubhouse baffert was watching his colt prayer for relief gallop on the deep track none of them in my barn can run anyway , lukas said make no mistake these two are cowboys lukas , 75 , is from wisconsin , where as a boy he bought horses en route to the slaughterhouse , cleaned them up , trained them and sold them for a profit the whitehaired baffert began as a jockey , a bad one by his own admission , in his native new mexico that s my big horse , the west virginia derby winner , baffert said , tongue firmly in cheek between them , lukas , 75 , and baffert , 58 , have won 22 legs of the the muchcoveted classics including seven victories in the  he s got a nice neck , lukas offered i like the way he moves , bob he s moving really well the two watched prayer for relief stride out in silence neither of them moved suddenly , a herd of horses and their riders poured onto the track in a rainbow of saddlecloths bearing the initials of their trainers there was the npz logo of the hall of famer nick zito , the tap of todd pletcher and the cc of clement , all bouncing by lukas and baffert remained still i 've been stabled here for 32 summers , lukas said there s no place like it , especially on mornings like these we 're going to bury you there in the infield when you die , wayne , baffert said , smiling no , put me right here on the track , lukas countered just harrow me under then , he turned his pony back to the track and his work i 'd be happy , he called back over his shoulder , harrowed right under here
tampa , fla freddy garcia dipped into his memory bank the other morning , his mind drifting to a seattle special of an afternoon , cool and overcast , during the 2001 playoffs , when he was the 25yearold ace of the mariners garcia recalled how pumped fastball after fastball past his seattle teammates to secure the division series opener for the cleveland indians he was good , garcia said real good five days later , garcia exacted revenge , outdueling colon to extend the mariners' season that day , garcia said , i was better those games , tense as a stretched rubber band , serve as prelude for another competition the turned back the clock for their rotation derby , inviting fading stars like and , with 4 allstar berths and 286 victories between them , to gauge whether they can retire major league hitters consistently enough to merit a starting job the yankees are not expecting a return to the halcyon days of 2005 , when colon won the with the angels and garcia silenced the astros to snap an 88year championship drought for the  competence is paramount durability would be nice excellence is desired , but not required with the yankees' offense and newly fortified bullpen , a quality start three runs , six innings from any of the rotation candidates , sergio mitre and ivan nova included , would be welcomed , appreciated and accepted we 're going to make this team better , garcia said , referring to colon , his teammate on the 2009 white sox we already have three starters , and now we have a couple more guys who can pitch we can pitch we have a lot of good pitching we can do the job we can respond cliff lee s decision to sign with philadelphia left a glut of middling freeagent starters , none of whom intrigued general manager brian cashman enough to give them the security of a guaranteed contract not garcia , who was 126 with a 464 earned run average last season for the white sox , and certainly not colon , 37 , who last climbed a major league mound on july 24 , 2009 , and whose recent performance 1421 , 518 era in 48 appearances across four injurymarred seasons would hardly merit a second look they 're not high , cashman said when asked his expectations for colon but at the same time , i respond to my scouts they said he s worthy enough to take a look at one recommendation came from the bench coach tony pena , who managed colon in winter ball , for guilas cibae as in the dominican republic obviously he s not throwing 97 or 98 miles per hour anymore , pena said , but he was still pitching at 93 , 94 , cutting the ball real well and his control was pretty good there were plenty of good things with no translator available , colon declined a request for an interview the few times colon has thrown in the bullpen , manager joe girardi has come away impressed , but much has to happen if he is to evolve from spring training curiosity into viable rotation candidate even if colon does , girardi did not know whether , having not logged 100 innings in any season since 2005 , he could withstand the rigors of a full season a guy with his accomplishments , he could easily have said that he was done , said brian anderson , a former white sox outfielder and a nonroster invitee who is trying to resurrect his career as a pitcher that guy s been the best , he s been on top , but if he can motivate himself and try to prove himself again , then it makes it easy for someone like me garcia earned the nickname big game freddy in chicago , where anderson saw him pitch with two distinct styles but always fearlessly and relentlessly before shoulder surgery , when garcia worked in the 90s and reminded him of felix hernandez , and afterward , when garcia depended on guile and changing speeds i'm getting older , garcia , 34 , said i do n't throw that hard anymore i have to throw what i have garcia has a slider , a curveball , a changeup , a splitter and , only occasionally , a fastball he threw a fastball only 302 percent of the time last season , down from 434 percent in 2009 , according to , and it averaged 878 miles an hour , the slowest of his career many of garcia s peripheral statistics his rising walk rate , his falling strikeout rate , his home run tendencies have deteriorated , though he acquitted himself well in a home ballpark , us cellular field , viewed as hitterfriendly as yankee stadium savvy pitchers can compensate for a diminished repertory , and cashman compared garcia to livan hernandez , another righthander with a winding career they 're masters at what they do , cashman said they know how to pitch , they can locate , they can dissect hitters but he added about garcia , in terms of assessing pure physical ability , there s nothing to get excited about anymore whoever snags the final two spots in the rotation could hold them for a few weeks or a few months , but probably not an entire season , not with cashman on the prowl for starting help if garcia or colon is passed over , he will become a free agent and thus resume his search for work , for an opportunity , once again that is how things work , garcia said i 've been around a long time , he said
during his secondset meltdown sunday against rafael nadal , the argentine veteran raised his racket in disgust and despair , brandishing it above his head at arthur ashe stadium soon , it appeared , the racket would be smashed to pieces the chair umpire , pascal maria of france , watched closely in anticipation but it did not happen suddenly , nalbandian pulled back from the abyss , lowered his racket and walked to the sideline , his moment of fury defused for tennis fans with long memories , it was a chance to ponder the ebb and flow of anger management between players and officials in the last 30 years not everyone has adopted the nalbandian style feel it , cool it , move on on opening day , ryan harrison , who was fined 2 , 100 at the for flinging his racket over a fence , lost his temper on the louis armstrong court venting his frustration , harrison slammed his racket and kicked a ball into the crowd during his firstround loss to marin cilic but the chair umpire , louise engzell of sweden , kept her cool later that afternoon , grew contentious and challenged no fewer than five calls the chair umpire , lynn welch of the united states , calmly acceded to her repeated requests for video replays the next night , andrey golubev of kazakhstan disputed several decisions in his firstround loss to nadal , gesturing and glaring at his opponent , the crowd and the chair umpire , carlos ramos of portugal ramos ignored him none of the players' behavior was deemed disruptive or excessive even so , by tuesday night , umpires had cited 30 players for 33 code violations that drew 44 , 600 in fines the offenses included audible obscenities , abuse of rackets and equipment and unsportsmanlike conduct what is different from the bad old days \? paid professional umpires have replaced unpaid volunteers , and players can resort to electronic replays to verify a call they think is wrong as a result , gone are the towering tantrums of ilie nastase , the umpire baiting of and the crude gestures of jimmy connors it was dreadful , said dick roberson , a world team tennis supervisor of officials who was hired by the atp in 1979 and became the chief grand prix supervisor nobody wanted to sit courtside because of the vulgar language , he said roberson s mandate from the men s international professional tennis council was to conduct training , devise evaluations and certify professional chair umpires who could stand up to misbehaving players one of roberson s early recruits was rich kaufman , now the open s chief umpire another recruit was jim tunney , who refereed three super bowls and was put to work in world team tennis matches in california you know why i got him \? roberson said of tunney so he could handle nastase the most notorious outburst of that era came from mcenroe , who repeatedly screamed at a wimbledon chair umpire in 1981 , including , you cannot be serious ! it became the title of mcenroe s autobiography it is unlikely that mcenroe would now choose to say , are you , sir , perhaps , not serious \? but in the different atmosphere today , players are often more respectful toward officials some are downright sympathetic i think it s a tough job being an umpire , roger federer said last week i think players know that , too one umpire who might have been pleased to hear federer s remarks is dr charles f beck , who faced a fellow new yorker s ire in the late 1970s and the 1980s as i drove along , i examined the match that i had done with john mcenroe , he wrote in his 1988 memoir , a view from the tall chair ten years with the men s pro tour why did he behave so badly \? why did i put myself in a position to listen to him \? is it worth that to an umpire \? no one , in my whole life , had ever yelled at me like that in all of my participation in sports , no player had ever behaved that way beck , who spent a decade on the road working at tournaments , found himself questioning his competence in the wake of mcenroe s tonguelashing should i stop \? he wrote is it possible that he is right \? maybe i am not a good official maybe , with his restraint and selfexamination , beck was a better official than he realized today , some top players still cannot control their anger at the french open in may , fernando verdasco of spain drew a 5 , 000 fine for repeated audible obscenities still , some others have managed to curb their enthusiasm for even mild tantrums at wimbledon in july , jowilfried tsonga of france missed a pop volley that could have pulled him out of a downward spiral against novak djokovic in the semifinals as his shot landed long , tsonga raised his racket and appeared ready to slam it into the center court turf then he checked his motion , gingerly placed the racket in his mouth and sank his teeth into the frame tennis anger managed , released and left behind
joel p bennett , the lawyer for one of the women who has made accusations against mr cain , said that his client had decided not to go public or to make a public statement herself in an effort to shield herself from the media frenzy swirling around the situation she s not going to affirmatively make any public statements or public appearances about the case , everything will be through me , mr bennett said she has a life to live and a career , and she doesn t want to become another anita hill but mr bennett said he would send on thursday a proposed statement to the national restaurant association in which he would make clear that his client s version of the events between herself and mr cain were different from the version that the presidential candidate has offered he said he needs the association to agree that the statement would not violate a nondisclosure agreement on his client when she left the group in the late 1990s she certainly wanted to say something counter to what mr cain has been saying , he said , adding that he hoped the statement would help restore her reputation and validate the claims she made at the time as of now , my expectation is that it will not go into details about the incident she does not want to do that , he said this is a statement that she feels sets forth her position in a fair and honest way mr bennett said he would like to issue the statement tomorrow he said if the association refused to grant permission , i ll be issuing a statement that the negotiations has failed and i hope the media will put pressure on them to change their position he said the statement would not go into minute details of the incident with mr cain it s unpleasant and it s sensational and she does not want to do that updated 7 15 pm herman cain on

told him that there was only one case , one set of charges , one woman while i was at the national restaurant association those charges were baseless , but i thought he needed to know about them i don t recall anyone else being in the room when i told him mr anderson told the new york times that he was not the source of the allegations , saying , i d never heard any of these allegations until i read them in politico , nor does anything i read in the press change my opinion that herman is an upstanding man and a gentleman in the interview , mr anderson denied being told about any allegations he said he still likes and respects mr cain , but added herman needs to issue an apology to me that s what needs to happen questions about how the harassment allegations surfaced on politico over the weekend have dominated conversation in washington for days mr cain has said he believes that he is being targeted by someone on the left or the right there are factions that are trying to destroy me , personally , as well as this campaign , he said meanwhile , a republican pollster who is supporting mr perry s presidential campaign said wednesday that he had witnessed harassment by mr cain in the 1990s , but also denied being the source of the allegations and separately , the associated press reported wednesday afternoon that a third woman had come forward to anonymously accuse mr cain of sexual harassment in the 1990s , a charge that his campaign vigorously denied mr cain has said over the past two days at public events that we could see other baseless allegations made against him as this appalling smear campaign continues , jd gordon , a spokesman for the campaign , said in a statement he has never acted in the way alleged by insidethebeltway media , and his distinguished record over 40 years spent climbing the corporate ladder speaks for itself the pollster who supports mr perry , chris wilson , worked with the national restaurant association in the 1990s when mr cain headed the group , and said on an oklahoma radio station that everybody was aware of the issue if she comes out and talks about it , like i said , it ll probably be the end of his campaign , mr wilson told ktok radio , referring to an incident between a woman and mr cain at a restaurant in crystal city , va , in the 1990s it was only a matter of time because so many people were aware of what took place

research in washington , is a pollster for make america great again , the super pac run by one of mr perry s former top aides in the 1990s , he worked for tony fabrizio , a leading republican pollster who now is a senior adviser to mr perry s campaign but in an interview with the times , mr wilson denied having provided any information to politico to be clear , and you can ask any of the reporters covering this story , i had nothing to do with leaking this in any way , and i ve never discussed or shared this story with any of my clients period , mr wilson said mr wilson declined to elaborate on his comments to the radio station and refused to name the woman at the crystal city restaurant he said the incident took place at a table with several people , and that it made many of them uncomfortable he would not say what mr cain said to the woman or whether the woman responded at the time in his remarks to the radio station , mr wilson said , i was the pollster at the national restaurant association when herman cain was head of it and i was around a couple of times when this happened , and anyone who was involved with the nra at the time knew that this was going to come up

him on the restaurant association account , but never mentioned the allegations at the time i have no idea what he s talking about , mr fabrizio said in an interview wednesday he never spoke to me about it mr fabrizio said he met mr cain in 1993 and has had a cordial relationship with him ever since he said he was very fond of mr cain and decided to work on the perry campaign because he believed that he was the strongest republican candidate he said he disagreed with mr cain s assertion that republicans were trying to discredit him or topple his rising presidential campaign do people on the right want to take him down \? none that i m aware of , mr fabrizio said there are people competing with him to be the nominee by being the nominee , that means winning he added everyone points fingers at everyone else it s one of those things this is not the first time nor will be the last time that stuff like this happens in a presidential campaign ray sullivan , a spokesman for mr perry s campaign , said none of the people involved with mr perry s campaign had anything to do with the allegations no one involved in our campaign was in any way involved with this story , mr sullivan said any claim to the contrary is patently untrue and false mr cain s chief of staff , mark block , on wednesday night demanded that mr perry apologize , saying it was his staff that had begun a smear campaign the actions of the perry campaign are despicable rick perry and his campaign owe herman cain and his family an apology , mr block said on fox news special report program mr block said mr cain divulged information about the harassment allegations to mr anderson in 2003 approximately two weeks ago mr anderson went to work for the rick perry campaign , mr block said what else happened about two weeks ago \? politico began this smear campaign citing anonymous sources
the american embrace of fullcontact japanese game shows from reconditioned originals like the former mxc on spike to clones like wipeout on abc has to do with the appeal of bright colors , spectacular crashes and other people s embarrassment and discomfort and , of course , the pleasure of rooting for a winner after all the carnage , someone is crowned champion the popularity of these japanesestyle shows will be affirmed on monday night , when the twohour season finale of the cult favorite series in which americans compete for a chance to travel to yokohama to take on the brutal obstacle course of the semiannual japanese televised competition sasuke moves from the cable channel g4 to its sister network nbc for one night at least , the course s rope ladders , halfpipes and rolling barrels will be shown in network prime time , keeping company with the likes of hawaii five0 and bachelor pad this increased exposure for american ninja warrior and by extension for sasuke comes despite the fact that these shows' distinctive , addictive premise is a profoundly unamerican one a game in which nobody wins almost nobody , that is in 26 previous sasuke shows , dating to 1997 , each including 100 mostly japanese competitors , only 3 men have successfully completed the obstacle course one in 1999 , one in 2006 and one in 2010 \( reflecting the democratic nature of the truly rigorous competition , which attracts celebrities as well as a variety of professional athletes , the three winners , all japanese , have been a crabber , a fisherman and a shoe salesman \) out of 2 , 600 total competitors , only 22 , none of them american , have made it to the course s fourth and final stage 90 percent are eliminated in the first stage what happens , typically , is that a handful of men make it to the third round 6 out of 100 in the most recent competition , in january and then meekly succumb , losing their grip on the spinning doorknob grasper or the painfully thin ledges of the ultimate cliff hanger and splashing into the water below congratulations are handed out , some hearty banzais uttered , and then everyone heads home to prepare for the next nearly hopeless competition six months hence but this is not the american way , and a few years ago g4 set out to do something about it with broadcasts of the original japanese sasuke \( dubbed and retitled ninja warrior \) ranking among its most highly rated shows , it decided to create the american ninja warrior series , in which 300 candidates go through a as well as rounds of obstaclecourse training in california from them , a team of 10 americans is selected to join the 100man field in japan this approach has yielded not just a recurring eightepisode tv series for american consumption \( the first six episodes of the current season of american ninja warrior have averaged about 300 , 000 viewers for g4 \) but a noticeable improvement on the course in january s game four of the six contestants who reached the third round were american this represented a stunning reversal no more than one american had gone that far in any previous competition you could look at this trend in several ways perhaps it s heartening that as american fortunes appear to be in decline in so many areas , there is one place where we 're on the rise , even if it is just a japanese obstacle course or perhaps it s dispiriting that american money and aggressiveness are threatening to dominate an event that has been a semiannual festival of friendly competition and oddball theatricality for japanese audiences in the american ninja warrior finale on monday night , you will not see anything besides the 10 american competitors as far as the show is concerned , the other 90 contestants do n't exist if a nonamerican finishes the course , you wo n't find out from nbc \( g4 now shows the threehour japanese broadcast of the full competition sometime after its american series finishes , and with much less fanfare \) the carnival atmosphere that helps make the japanese show entertaining , with contestants dressed in superman costumes or carrying octopuses , is absent so is the congenial ambience in which failure is expected and success is a pleasant surprise that does n't mean that american ninja warrior is a bust there is a builtin tension and excitement in watching one superb amateur athlete after another tackle the monumental sasuke course the show can be mesmerizing in spite of the humorlessness and manufactured drama typical of american sportscasting will there be an american winner by the end of monday s show \? no spoilers here but i would n't take my eyes off the ultimate cliff hanger too early if i were you
senator james m inhofe , the oklahoma republican and the dean of congressional naysayers on the need for action on climate and energy , appeared to come up emptyhanded today inhofe had requested that the commerce department inspector general investigate whether emails and other information revealed in the hacking of climate files at the university of east anglia in december 2009 revealed any wrongdoing by scientists at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the news release from inhofe s office today held slim pickings if the hope was to uncover a scandal a mention of a possible irregularity in some contracts with no discernible bearing on the quality of climate science the phrase warrants further action was used in the release to describe eight email messages that the inspectors found might potentially point to integrity issues the problem is that the agency conducted interviews and document reviews and provided explanations in the report none of which raised red flags \( inhofe plans to pursue more investigations of these emails nonetheless , his release said the report described some potentially improper actions related to the handling of requests filed under the freedom of information act while it did not name the scientist involved , the subject was clearly susan solomon , the agency scientist who was the coleader of the 2007 science report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change the inspector general s report , however , was unable to come to a conclusion because solomon s description of advice she received on providing files related to the climate panel lay in the arena of she says , he says , with little sign of a route forward \( inhofe sees an opportunity here , though you can read his reaction at the bottom of the post climateauditorg is digging , as well , of course \) ah , but there was the final matter of the photo montage depicting inhofe , along with an array of scientists questioning aspects of global warming theory , as imperiled on shrinking floes of sea ice it was deemed in bad taste by jane lubchenco , the agency administrator and it like a heap of other meanspirited artwork generated around climategate was indeed in bad taste here s a link to the full report , and below you can read the core conclusions , distributed by the oceanic and atmospheric agency earlier today the inspector general s report states specifically we found no evidence in the cru emails that noaa inappropriately manipulated data comprising the global historical climatology network monthly ghcnm dataset \( page 11 \) we found no evidence in the cru emails to suggest that noaa failed to adhere to its peer review procedures prior to its dissemination of information \( page 11 \) we found no evidence in the cru emails to suggest that noaa violated its obligations under the iqa \( page 12 \) we found no evidence in the cru emails to suggest that noaa violated its obligations under the shelby amendment \( page 16 \) the report notes a careful review of eight emails that it said warranted further examination to clarify any possible issues involving the scientific integrity of particular noaa scientists or noaa s data , that was completed and did not reveal reason to doubt the scientific integrity of noaa scientists or data the report questions the way noaa handled a response to four foia requests in 2007 the foia requests sought documents related to the review and comments of part of an intergovernmental panel on climate change \( ipcc \) report noaa scientists were given legal advice that ipcc work done by scientists were records of the ipcc , not noaa the requesters were directed to the ipcc , which subsequently made available the review , comments and responses which are online at https www ipccwg1 unibe ch publications wg1ar4 wg1ar4 html and http hclharvardedu collections ipcc indexhtml here s inhofe s statement related to solomon s handling of the freedom of information act request it also appears that one senior noaa employee possibly thwarted the release of important federal scientific information for the public to assess and analyze her justification for blocking the release was contradicted by two career attorneys in the office of general counsel this is no doubt a serious matter that deserves further investigation read the rest  i m all for aggressive use , and enforcement , of freedom of information laws , as is the union of concerned scientists but hopefully further action on solomon s case won t stray into harassment

hershey , pa bobby butler , a firstyear pro with the binghamton senators , was named the most valuable player in the american hockey league allstar classic , which was held monday night before a sellout crowd of 10 , 376 butler , 23 , scored one goal and had three assists in the minor league showcase that saw 19 goals and no penalties it just moving the puck , just making passes and putting the puck in the net , said butler , a native of marlborough , mass nothing crazy it was a good time the nhl has the glitz with its millionaire superstars and heavily promoted events but the ahl , which is 75 seasons old , is a proving ground for many of the players who eventually make it in the nhl twentyseven of the players in this year s nhl allstar game in raleigh , nc have previously played in the american league what the ahl lacks in glamor it makes up in enthusiasm at least in hershey , a hockey town if there ever was one the hershey bears , a minor league affiliate of the washington capitals and the league champion last year , have a proud tradition and a fierce rivalry with the nearby wilkesbarre scranton penguins there was nothing fancy about how the ahl organized the game and no fantasy draft to pick the teams instead , the eastern conference played \( and defeated \) the western conference like the nhl allstar game , the ahl s was a demonstration of offensive prowess with virtually no checking and little attempt at defensive play the heaviest contact appeared to be during the first intermission when the mascots took the ice for a quick pickup game tux , the mascot of the penguins , emerged later with his arm in a fake sling the contest was a seesaw affair with the west taking a 41 lead only to end fall behind 64 halfway through the second period the teams keep notching goals up to the final minute with the east winning , 118 still , the fans got a glimpse of erstwhile and potentially future nhl players andrew gordon , a right wing with the bears , who has been already done a stint with the capitals this season , set a record by scoring 16 seconds into the game he scored again midway through the third period alexandre giroux , a former hershey bears fan favorite who now plays for the oklahoma city barons , received a thunderous ovation from the crowd in his first trip back to the city where he first became an ahl star as the captain of the western conference team , giroux chalked up a goal and an assist the festivities started with a skills competition on sunday afternoon the glass was taken down , providing a level of intimacy between the crowd and players who lingered to sign autographs viatcheslav voynov , a defenseman from chelyabinsk , russia , who plays for the manchester monarchs , was the fastest skater bears defensive brian fahey took home the hardest shot honors , registering his winner at 969 miles per hour his two allotted shots missed the net , but he was given an extra one , which he converted fahey acknowledged the extra shot was probably the advantage of being the home town hershey guy connecticut whale forward jeremy williams won the shooting accuracy contest while john curry of wilkesbarre scranton won the goaltending award the slickest move during the skills competition came when linus klasen of the milwaukee admirals did a 360degree spin during the breakaway contest to beat martin jones , a goalie for the monarchs i didn t know what he was doing , said jones i thought he might have lost the puck ahl president david andrews told reporters the league was exploring the possibility of playing next year s allstar classic against a team from russia s kontinental hockey league , swedish elite league or finnish elite league under one scenario , the ahl s eastern conference allstars would play the foreign club in an eastern city and the western conference would take on the foreign team in a western city two nights later we are investigating whether it has legs for television , he said if you have the best team out of the khl or the swedish elite league , you d have a hell of a game andrews acknowledged , however , that it was not clear if a european league would allow its team to travel for the event whatever format is chosen , two cities are already interested in hosting next s year classic , he said , although the formal bidding process has not started given the relative lack of drama in monday night s game , it is understandable the ahl might be considering a change but gordon , a crowd favorite whose play prompted chants of gordo , gordo , said the contest grew more intense as the game went on it was looking pretty grim early , he said of his eastern conference team a few tictacktoe plays got us back into it you know it s going to be a highscoring game you ve just got to keep plugging away
john boehner , the new speaker , promised the incoming house members of the 112th congress on wednesday to give the government back to the american people but away from the camera , the chamber s new republican leadership is busy doing the opposite darrell issa of california , the new chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform , to 150 businesses and trade groups , asking them for suggestions on loosening what he called jobkilling corporate regulations this , of course , has nothing to do with mr boehner s tearful populism and everything to do with the tens of millions in corporate dollars that helped propel the republicans to power in the house businesses have complained about the obama administration s expanded , and necessary , oversight of finance , health care and food production , among other areas now they have helped elect a house leadership that is eager to do their bidding mr issa did not have to wait long for answers to his query to cite just a few financial companies have protested the new controls on debitcard fees , which were enacted to save small businesses billions of dollars and to lower prices manufacturers said they did not like the proposed epa limits on greenhouse gas emissions , intended to begin addressing global warming there were even complaints about the cost to business of proposed federal limits on how long truck drivers can be behind the wheel , which would save lives on the highway none of this should be surprising , especially coming from mr issa , who has already made clear his intention to harass the obama administration with seven hearings a week , times 40 weeks one of his targets , he has said , would be the new consumer financial protection bureau , which is intended to curb some of the financial industry s worst practices and help head off another meltdown apparently he required no hearings or the slightest smidgen of evidence to declare that president obama is one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times , even if he now claims that corrupt does not mean criminal the new republican leaders love to insert the phrase jobkilling in front of everything they oppose , hoping it might mask their true intentions mr boehner has been speaker for just one day but it is already clear that the republicans' plan is to serve their corporate donors , above all else
luzardiden , france , the defending champion of the , lost precious time to his main rivals thursday in a grueling stage in which he had been expected to begin a longawaited push after a problematic opening stage , contador had been shadowing the other favorites closely for the first week and a half of this tour , a pattern that continued until the final seconds of the 12th stage thursday on the last of three stiff climbs toward this ski resort in the pyrenees , contador , breathing heavily and visibly struggling , was unable to keep pace with the schleck brothers , andy and frank , and another leading rider , cadel evans contador , with the saxo banksungard team , lost 13 seconds in the overall standings to andy schleck , the runnerup last year , and 33 seconds to frank schleck , twice a fifthplace finisher both brothers ride with the leopard trek team of luxembourg contador also fell another 13 seconds behind evans , of bmc , who has been riding well this year if contador is worried about his chances , he did not show it afterward i did n't feel quite right in my legs , but it s going better and better , he told reporters against the odds , and even his own prediction wednesday , thomas voeckler , a frenchman with europcar , held on to the yellow jersey thursday by staying with the race favorites until the final seconds , despite not being known as a strong climber on the final climb i was still in the race with the best climbers , voeckler said i told myself , keep going , keep going , keep going' samuel s nchez , a spaniard with euskaltel euskadi , won the 131mile stage which began in cugnaux , near toulouse in 6 hours 1 minute 15 seconds s nchez , who finished fourth over all last year , is now in eighth place , just behind contador , a fellow spaniard before bastille day crowds in team jerseys , national flags or just their underwear , the riders faced their first toplevel climb this year , the almost 7 , 000foot col du tourmalet , an ascent that is steeped in tour history none of the favorites attacked on the way up the tourmalet , though leopard trek showed strong discipline , with a veteran german rider , jens voigt , in pole position at the head of the peloton the pass caused a bit of trouble for andy schleck he stopped twice , once to change a wheel and a second time to right himself after touching wheels with another rider at the top of the tourmalet , some riders stuffed their jerseys with newspapers to protect themselves against a foggy chill for the highspeed descent then , on the final climb to luzardiden , the action heated up in the peloton after a quick discussion with his brother , andy schleck went on the attack then frank schleck moved ahead of the group contador and voeckler were left behind by a number of riders i do n't think today was a day made for us , but i do n't think it was a decisive day , andy schleck said in a television interview of contador , he added , he s not unbeatable , that s clear in the standings , contador is four minutes behind voeckler , 2 minutes 11 seconds behind frank schleck , 1 54 behind evans and 1 43 behind andy schleck , though he moved into seventh place over all from 16th a day before contador , who faces a hearing after the tour at the court of arbitration for sport after testing positive last summer for clenbuterol , a banned weightloss and musclebuilding drug , brushed off the loss of time thursday there are a number of climbing stages in theory , tailormade for him still to come i stayed prudent today , contador said i saw that the two brothers were speaking with each other and then each one of them played his card , he said of the schlecks i'm still happy with this first mountain stage
it is a bit hard to imagine what wimbledon is like for andy murray , who spends two weeks as the white hot center of british obsession on the left side of the atlantic , the focus at wimbledon on wednesday was jowilfried tsonga s upset of the once unupsettable roger federer and murray is just the guy who never wins any tournaments of consequence and plays with such outward discomfort it appears as if someone has starched his underwear but the british never take their focus off murray , starch and all , because he is the only man who can break the 75year british drought in men s singles champions at their beloved tournament he has teased them again by reaching the semifinals , his quarterfinal victory over feliciano lopez heralded by with the declaration , five down , two to go marvels at the weight of expectations heaped on a guy who has n't won a tournament of any consequence the current problem for the great british hope is , reaching one to go requires beating no 1 rafael nadal writes that murray believes he can do it , but he does n't have a lot of company in that theory as , there is nadal and then there is everybody else the everybody else category definitely now includes federer , who had a twosetstonone lead snatched from him by tsonga to further dent his nowbattered armor but , , this match was more about tsonga s emergence than federer s retreat the talented but maddeningly inconsistent , but , he has the game to be a definite threat to the top three so does 18yearold bernard tomic , garber writes , even though he fell to novak djokovic in their quarterfinal the four men left fighting for the title all have motivating forces , , but only murray s involves a former empire hanging on his every grimace there will be a lot of grimacing going on the next few days as the nba hurtles toward a lockout in fact , you might just want to pull your nfl grimace out of the closet and put it back on to save time most everyone , , is approaching this is a potentially long and grisly fight while that the league can ill afford to end up in the same mess it was in 1999 that the league will have to be smart about how much fan alienation it can afford causing some rancor on the union side are some players' issues with billy hunter and his views on money ,  the nfl , by the way , is still stuck in an endless cycle of emanating hope and dismay from its money grablockout , with throwing the latest bucket of water on hope bucking the trend , the nhl is still operating , with free agency starting friday wednesday was spent in , with three teams awaiting news on which team he will join in his comeback to the nhl , but it is not unlike jagr to throw a little extra drama into the mix we hope the nhl took a break from jagrmania to read what , warning that the league must do more to protect its players heads before someone dies at center ice in the bizarre hodgepodge of other news wednesday , interview that he was part of the beginning of baseball s steroids era by juicing while filming major league in 1999 the golfer robert garrigus he used a different kind of drug earlier in his career and even smoked pot during rounds on the nationwide tour and the fulham owner mohamed al fayed is taking his michael jackson obsession to new lows , he installed outside his stadium let s hope the british take their eyes off andy murray for a few seconds to roll them at that
in our new sunday dialogue feature , we are inviting readers to respond to an interesting or provocative letter most recently , \( june 15 \) here is the original letter , followed by a sampling of reader responses , and a reply from the first writer re \( column , june 10 \) why does david brooks feel the need to refer back to edmund burke and anthony trollope to find an exemplary politician \? we have one in the white house president obama has been excoriated by both the left and the right with the most extreme and unrealistic invective used against any president in my lifetime , yet has never responded in kind he has treated his opponents with respect , even when their opposition was beyond disrespectful he has taken the time to reflect and seek the counsel of the wise and learned , even when he was being accused of inaction , yet has acted decisively when necessary and he has taken the opportunity to instruct us in our highest concerns , even when the throng was calling for soaring rhetoric in short , he has personified precisely the standards of political excellence burke set forth if only the american electorate cared david berman new york , june 10 , 2011 i agree with david berman s assessment of president obama s restraint in responding to unfair attacks from both sides of the political spectrum most political consultants would probably take him to task for this \( is n't the preferred response to political distortion and outright lies to hit back \? \) but the president seems to respect our intelligence enough not to address the more absurd claims made by his opponents for example , that he s a socialist , that he s defeatist , that his worldview is informed by kenyan , anticolonial behavior or that his policies are merely a continuation of george w bush s but i do think that david brooks might have been on to something by invoking edmund burke after watching the most recent debate among the candidates for the republican presidential nomination , i thought of this burke quote it is a general popular error to suppose the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare niels aaboe new york , june 15 , 2011 president obama is n't a model of civility when he was a united states senator , his stump speech accused republicans of social darwinism in a speech to the house democratic caucus , president obama suggested that republicans do n't have a sense of neighborliness or community , and are not willing to help people who are vulnerable in fact , republicans do support some public assistance programs , and private charity as well as such , president obama s comments are just a derisive caricature despite calling for civil debate , mr obama nonetheless resorts to namecalling and demonizing , and does little to denounce fellow party members who do the same he has praised representative debbie wasserman schultz , the chairwoman of the democratic national committee , despite her claims that republicans are waging war on women and the unemployed and have proposed a budget that is a death trap for the elderly when my opponents call me names , it s demonizing and abusive rhetoric when i call them names , then it s tough but true alasdair denvil richmond , va , june 15 , 2011 david berman is correct that president obama is more than the equal of the goodguy politicians touted by edmund burke or anthony trollope but one must also remember that the burke and trollope statesmen operated in an elitist society marked by deference , aristocratic privilege , a rigid class structure and patriarchy these features make comparisons with our own time problematic , if not dangerously nostalgic alan posner east lansing , mich , june 15 , 2011 regarding niels aaboe s letter david brooks made clear that his nostalgia for edmund burke s standards of political excellence was a response to the degradations to which we 've been recently subjected i would say that these include anthony d weiner s and christopher lee s selfportraits , john edwards s indictment and sarah palin s bus tour to nowhere but these are cases so tawdry that burke would probably not have stooped to comment considered the progenitor of modern conservatism , he would have reserved his rhetorical fireworks for today s american right wing to its rigid and simpleminded ideologues he might have said , circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to its laissezfaire capitalists free trade is not based on utility but on justice to the antigay lobby toleration is good for all , or it is good for none to the right wing s second amendment sisters what is liberty without wisdom , and without virtue \? it is the greatest of all possible evils true , as alan posner points out , burke was of another time , and of a society more hierarchical than ours , but his strong sense of the duty of his class could certainly have instructed those republicans pandering to the tea party your representative owes you , not his industry only , but his judgment , and he betrays , instead of serving you , if he sacrifices it to your opinion and as for alasdair denvil s letter does he really mean to equate president obama s use of the term social darwinism with the comparisons of mr obama to hitler \? and is he really ready to defend republicans against the rather mild charge that they are unwilling to help the vulnerable \? the unemployed , the uninsured , the migrant workers who pick our fruit only to be deported , the poor who are losing medicaid benefits this very month these are vulnerable people whom republicans have been unwilling to help as burke said in the house of commons , let this position be analyzed , for analysis is the deadly enemy of all declamation david berman new york , june 15 , 2011
san francisco astrologers , not surprisingly , say they knew this would happen but that did n't stop a furious response among horoscope fans on friday , as news shot around cyberspace and , no doubt , outer space that the world s zodiac signs might somehow be out of whack , a development with potentially lifechanging impact on professional and personal relationships , pickup lines in singles' bars and , presumably , the daytoday schedule of the former first lady nancy reagan all of which left professional prognosticators seeking to calm their followers , and astronomers chuckling at the fate of their more metaphysical brethren do n't panic , lawrence grecco , who has worked for 20 years as astrologer and life coach in manhattan , assured his clients your sign is your sign but such assurances did little to quell the cosmic kerfuffle after the star tribune in minneapolis innocuously reported monday that a naturally occurring wobble in the direction of the s axis technically known as a precession had altered the alignment of stars' overhead from their traditional star signs , which date back several millennia the report , citing parke kunkle , a board member of the , quickly went viral mr kunkle , suddenly cast as the man who changed the zodiac , said he had just been commenting on a wellknown fact about the stars in relation to astrology reports of the shift resulted in existential , and occasionally grammatical , crises among aries , leos and even ophuchices \( more on this later \) around the nation and online my zodiac sign changed , wrote one upset twitter user on friday morning does that mean that i'm not anymore who i used to be \? ! \? according to the report , capricorn , which astrologers say begins its monthlong term in december , actually starts on jan 20 , based on the actual position of the stars aquarius , meanwhile , would be bumped to february and so on scientists say an ancient greek astronomer was the first to recognize the precession of the earth s axis , caused by the gravitational tug of the moon and the sun on a notquiteround earth so it is , said joe rao , an associate and guest lecturer at the at the hayden planetarium , that over time the earth s north pole is pointing toward different stars which means , in turn , that all of the zodiac positions which astrologers use as the foundation of their studies are inaccurate , he said as are , of course , any predictions made from them , he added this is , after all , the 21st century , mr rao said but such scorn from skeptics is to be expected , said , the author of a syndicated weekly horoscope column , who added that the idea that the zodiac was shifting was just another attempt to discredit astrology , in which one in four americans profess to believe , according to a 2009 pew research center poll mr brezsny and other astrologers say they have long known that the pairings of constellations and astrological signs do n't match , but that western astrologers do n't deal with stars as some other branches of astrology do but rather the planets and solar system if they 're going to question its foundations , he said in an email , referring to scientific skeptics , they should at least learn it well enough to know what they 're talking about mr brezsny said the argument that the zodiac was off kilter was old news but he was shocked how fast the star tribune article inspired by a blog item on the web site caught fire by friday , monty taylor , a veteran star man from manhattan , said he and other astrologers were emailing , saying , oh , here we go again one step forward and two steps back even more shocking for some was the report that the 12sign system would be adding a new , and ominously a 13th , sign ophiuchus , the snake holder which ancient babylonians dumped \( maybe they were superstitious \? \) its cycle runs from nov 29 to dec 17 , making it the unofficial sign of holiday shoppers some likened it to the 2006 news that long considered the smallest , cutest planet was being reclassified as a dwarf planet first we were told that pluto is not a planet , now there s a new zodiac sign , ophiuchus , read one tweet from someone with the handle harrypotterish my childhood was a bloody lie william duvendack , a st louis astrologer on the board of the , said he had been inundated with questions it s been a lot of damage control , said mr duvendack , fielding questions from shaken clients i'm having to reassure them that this is all factored into astrology for all that , mr brezsny and others said their craft would survive the confusion and the skeptics if only because its adherents are so passionate astrology is a poetic language of the soul , not a scientific method , he said , likening it to a neruda poem , kandinsky paintings or a nick cave song none of those things are rational or scientific , he added not everyone was upset with the news of the supposed star shift mr duvendack said he had at least one astrology buff respond happily a woman who told me she 'd always felt there were one or two traits about sagittarius that did n't fit her personality , mr duvendack said but that the new sign is spot on
fiftyfour senators voted yesterday to confirm the nomination of an experienced and accomplished lawyer , caitlin halligan , to the dc circuit , which in the twisted and blindly ideological world of the united states senate means she didn t get confirmed these days , getting anything through the senate requires a 60vote majority , because that is what it takes to overcome a filibuster and the republicans will filibuster pretty much anything that president obama or his democratic colleagues want actually , they don t even have to filibuster , they just have to say they will and the senate comes to a halt nominations for the dc circuit are particularly tricky because that court decides many important cases about the workings of government , like those about the treatment of detainees at guantanamo bay it is a potential stepping stone to the supreme court , as it was for antonin scalia , clarence thomas , ruth bader ginsburg and john roberts jr , whose seat has been vacant for six years since he became a justice ms halligan was nominated to fill mr roberts former seat but the opposition to ms halligan is entirely without substance , based largely on the old activism canard when republicans call judges activists , they only mean that they have ruled in ways republicans don t like the justices in the conservative majority on the supreme court , who blithely overturn decades of precedent are not , of course , activists mr mcconnell said ms halligan s has a record of advocacy for an activist view of the judiciary and a legal career that leads any reasonable person to conclude that she would bring that activism to the court right , as long that person doesn t actually know anything about her record , which lincoln caplan , who writes about legal issues for the editorial board , actually does as he put it , by any sensible measure , ms halligan is a superb choice as the former solicitor general for the state of new york , she is a highly experienced and notably accomplished oral advocate , especially before appellate courts she has argued many times before state and federal appeals courts she has briefed over 40 cases for the supreme court she has been a successful partner at a major corporate law firm , has excellent academic qualifications , and the american bar association s committee on judicial nominations unanimously found her wellqualified when you cut through the ideological palaver against her , ms halligan sounds exactly like the kind of candidate for an important judgeship that republicans used to celebrate along with democrats she described her judicial philosophy as follows i believe that the role of a judge is a limited , but important one i think that the job is to apply the law to the facts , to do so in the context of a specific case that is presented to a court i believe that judges have to have a deep respect for precedent and , also , a full commitment to being fair and impartial with every case that comes before a judge she did once comment in a speech in 2003 that the courts are a special friend of liberty , a statement which her opponents find outrageous tells you a lot about her opponents , none of it good they don t think the courts of the united states are a friend of liberty \? four of the republicans who obediently voted against ms halligan susan collins of maine , lindsey graham of south carolina , john mccain of arizona and olympia snow of maine were members of the socalled gang of 14 that agreed back in 2005 that they would not support any filibuster except under extraordinary circumstances it s patently obvious there was nothing extraordinary here by tossing that deal in the trash , those four senators chose to back thuggish politics instead of doing their constitutional duty to provide consent as well as advice in the selection of judges
moncalieri , italy two hours after stage 17 of the concluded wednesday , 20 miles from the finish in nearby pinerolo , the brothers schleck retired to the idea hotel here , to plot how to elevate one of them no one will say who into first place by sunday evening their namesake , johny schleck , sipped a beer on a red leather couch in the lobby the middle of his three sons , frank , sat in third place with four stages remaining his youngest , andy , resided in fourth my two guys , he called them throughout their cycling careers , the schleck brothers have challenged conventional cycling dynamics where elite teams are generally built to assist one cyclist s chances of winning an overall race , the schlecks are both capable here , both close but they must soon choose , because one will win only with the other s help , which means , also , one must lose ground to assist the other but who \? even their father split his allegiance evenly that is a difficult question , he said my two guys are the best and there , it is 5050 on wednesday , through the alps , from gap , france , to pinerolo , the schlecks kept pace twice , alberto contador , the defending champion , attacked the schlecks initially lost ground , but caught contador by race s end \( norway s edvald boasson hagen won the stage and the frenchman thomas voeckler retained the yellow jersey , his lead shrinking by the day \) with frank schleck 1 minute 14 seconds ahead of andy , the brothers' problem only intensified afterward , at the team bus near the finish line , brian nygaard , the general manager of leopard trek , said his team had a plan in place , although he declined to divulge details instead , he argued that having both brothers near the top of the leader board forced other contenders , such as contador and australia s cadel evans , to chase both brothers , instead of one , if either frank or andy was far out in front people always say one brother is waiting for the other , nygaard said it s not true as nice as it would be to have two guys on the podium , we 're here to win the race they know exactly when that moment is they will do it , and they will do it gladly the schlecks come from luxembourg , which is to say they come from cycling stock johny schleck said his father was a cyclist , and his uncle , and his brother , and all three of his boys this is not uncommon there , he said , as the small country has produced of its share of elite cyclists johny waited to buy his boys bikes at first , wanted to see if they would come naturally to the family business they did , of course johny said the boys were not aggressive riders early , but that did not stop them from training he even canceled one vacation after purchasing three bikes the bikes , johny revealed wednesday , were yellow and constructed by none other than the cycling legend eddy merckx , a good friend who , johny said , gave me a good price the brothers schleck were already close back then they rode bikes together , watched the tour de france annually together and hunted wild boar together a trio of family pastimes both are built the same way tall , stick thin , with shirts that look as if they came from a store s juniors section sometimes they are mistaken for twins frank , 31 , is actually five years older than andy and five years younger than their oldest brother , steve frank is married , with a young daughter until very , very recently , nygaard said , andy lived at home the brothers compete with different styles , too frank is the more analytical of the two , the one more likely to study video of his races , the one who worries most andy developed earlier , by comparison , had more success at a younger age , twice finished this race in second place , but with a more carefree style having both in the draw is a competitive advantage , nygaard said they 're more than just teammates they 're brothers , and there s a telepathy , a tacit understanding that they have they know where the other guy is without even looking for all their differences , the brothers retain the same advantage , too , according to luca guercilena , a leopard trek trainer and retired rider with a degree in sports science guercilena administers endurance tests to all the team s riders , and while the formula is complicated , the results are not at peak form , andy schleck tests 5 to 10 percent higher than his teammates in terms of endurance capacity and recovery all his teammates except one , frank for sure , there is a genetic component there , guercilena said guercilena believes a winning race is broken into four components how cyclists perform in tests beforehand \( a 30 to 35 percent indicator \) , their technical ability \( 25 percent \) , their psychological makeup \( 20 percent \) and strategy \( the rest \) the schlecks could improve the most , he said , in their technical prowess , which includes perhaps their main weakness , individual time trials that the final stage of this race , before the ceremonial ride into paris , is an individual time trial only adds to the importance of the next two days the riders will return to france on thursday , where they will suffer up a series of the alps' most famous climbs frank schleck trails evans by four seconds , but both brothers , if they want to win , will need a lead of at least a minute or two by saturday , because both are inferior at time trials when compared to evans and contador still , at the team bus , surrounded by reporters , andy schleck said my confidence is good once again , i'm happy that i'm in the race leopard trek created this team , built it around the schleck brothers , specifically for this type of situation , late in the tour de france , still close both raced previously for saxo bank leopard trek began racing at the beginning of this season while the team expected challenges in its first year , it never could have predicted the low point it came at the giro d'italia , when wouter weylandt , a leopard trek cyclist from belgium , crashed on a descent and died he was 26 johny schleck said weylandt s death affected both his sons , but andy in particular took it hard he returned from the funeral in tears this tour de france took place too soon , johny added , for andy , who is still grieving , who lost more than a minute on a downhill descent on tuesday , who seems more tentative than normal if my two boys , if they finish , it s all the same to me , johny schleck said i'm happy when i do n't have to go to the hospital , when they 're healthy , safe but still , he was asked , is that not strange , that for one boy to win the other must also lose \? not to johny schleck he paused for a second , maybe two , then shrugged if frank wins , or andy wins , a schleck

president obama went to the border in el paso on tuesday and delivered on immigration reform he did n't present a bill or issue any executive orders or set deadlines for action aides say his goal was to create a pathway and a sense of urgency to move forward that is a start but not nearly enough the speech was right on its merits the immigration system is a shambles millions live here outside the law visa policies are too restrictive , cruelly separating families and driving away talented university graduates to other countries as mr obama dryly noted , we train them to create jobs for our competition he said our current laws stifle opportunity for exactly the people for whom this economy needs to recover entrepreneurs , students and lowwage workers illegality feeds a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor , mr obama said this is n't fair to american workers , or to the undocumented the overwhelming majority of whom , he said , are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families mr obama was also right when he said that the country has heard a lot of blame and a lot of politics and a lot of ugly rhetoric around immigration after listing the many ways his administration has gone above and beyond what republicans had demanded as their price for reform flooding the border with troops and technology to seal it tighter than ever he noted that the republicans were still not satisfied maybe they 'll need a moat , he joked maybe they 'll want alligators in the moat mr obama s description of the problem was accurate , and the right one a goodfaith effort by both parties to pass comprehensive measures that combine border security with assimilation , not mass expulsion , for illegal immigrants who qualify to move things forward , mr obama will have to do a lot more he needs to outline legislation , push congressional leaders including those in his own party to back it and make the case repeatedly to americans the president also needs to get his own policies in order for all his talk of supporting the hopes of the undocumented , his administration has been doubling down on the failed strategy of mass expulsion it is pressing state and local police to join in an illconceived program called , which sends arrested people s fingerprints through federal immigration databases , turning all local officers and jails into arms of the department of homeland security many lawmakers and police agencies say it erodes public safety by making immigrants , especially victims of domestic violence , afraid to report crimes they worry about giving rogue officers a convenient tool for racial profiling and they feel betrayed because what the administration once billed as a transparent , voluntary program aimed only at dangerous convicted criminals turns out to be none of those things the homeland security department s own data show that more than half of those deported under the program have no criminal records or committed only minor crimes mr obama and the homeland security secretary , janet napolitano , should heed the growing calls by lawmakers in california , illinois , new york and other places to abandon secure communities to preserve public safety as for the broader issue of immigration reform , mr obama s aides insisted on tuesday that he did , indeed , have a plan that interested americans could read if mr obama is really committed to this issue it s going to take a lot more than that

ellsinore , mo growing up in the rugged foothills of the ozarks , tommy adams always dreamed of carrying a badge he realized his wish through grim happenstance the incumbent sheriff , dogged by rumors of corruption , killed himself weeks before votes were cast , and mr adams slipped past him by a single vote for two troubled years , mr adams was sheriff of carter county , until his arrest last month on charges of distributing methamphetamine , the homebrewed drug that has poisoned much of this poor , sparsely populated stretch of timber country mr adams was accused of regularly snorting it as well but in this longstruggling community in southeastern missouri where distrust of law enforcement has always run deep , the story of a sheriff enabling the scourge he was supposed to fight has not provoked outrage rather , many local residents are accepting it , even sympathetically , as another disappointing chapter in what they see as a hopeless fight it shows how entrenched methamphetamine is in our system , said rocky kingree , the county prosecuting attorney it s something that has to be stopped , and it does n't seem like there is an end in sight for most of a decade , missouri has led the nation by a wide margin in the number of labs discovered to be producing methamphetamine , a highly addictive stimulant that can be made with household products like nasal decongestants and throughout the ozarks , the drug has metastasized in ellsinore , the creeping problem has strained the bonds of its 446 residents people recognize the symptoms of use in neighbors but , reflecting a culture of fierce independence , say nothing we all know who does what , how they do it and when they do it , said david bowman , a school maintenance worker who is the mayor of ellsinore you just turn your head and go on in a community where hunting is less a hobby than another way to put food on the table , mr adams was one of the many local boys who learned to string together a living out of odd jobs , working as a fry cook , an auto mechanic and the town s oneman , parttime police force three years ago , mr adams , who is now 31 , ran against the twoterm sheriff , greg melton there were persistent rumors about sheriff melton , including that he used methamphetamine several residents said last month that he had stolen from them or had sold them stolen goods less than a month before the election , mr melton was found dead in his garage , shot through the head the county coroner , who found a gun in mr melton s hand , said that despite rumors otherwise , there was no doubt he had killed himself mr adams s narrow victory put him in charge of three deputies and a 500squaremile region with 6 , 265 residents keeping a lower profile than his predecessor , he quickly became the subject of rumor himself he rarely met with community leaders or showed up at the office , where paperwork piled high on his desk he delegated to his chief deputy , who worried about his strange behavior mr adams began spending conspicuously , buying cars , building a cabin and paying for the in vitro fertilization that led to the birth , eight months ago , of his son like many people around here , he had grown up poor he declared bankruptcy in 2005 , with just 5 in cash and 300 in the bank and even though his new 37 , 000 salary , on top of his wife s pay as a nurse , represented good money in an area where the median household income is 27 , 000 , his spending raised eyebrows then there were his friends , including richard kearbey , who was arrested years earlier on charges of trying to buy 50 pounds of methamphetamine though a federal judge in a later case described him as the ringleader of a fairly large methamphetamine distribution network , mr kearbey served just seven days in jail instead , he worked as an undercover informant , helping arrest a number of smalltime meth cooks , according to federal court records \( neither mr kearbey nor his longtime lawyer responded to messages seeking comment \) after mr adams s house burned down early last year the man now charged with several arsons told the authorities that he had been commissioned by the sheriff himself to set it on fire he and his family moved next door to mr kearbey mr adams hired mr kearbey s daughter , steffanie , as a sheriff s deputy , though she had no experience in law enforcement just months earlier , mr adams had arrested the man who was then her husband on charges of methamphetamine possession now she was constantly by the sheriff s side , helping him carry out burglaries and sell guns from the evidence room , she told the authorities after her arrest last month in connection with the case , according to court records despite the growing concern , few of the two dozen residents interviewed about the events in recent days said they ever suspected that mr adams was using methamphetamine even those who noticed that his clothes hung more freely on his already slender frame saw none of the other telltale signs the rotted teeth , the compulsive movements , the erratic behavior a lawyer for mr adams did not return a call seeking comment but his friends and family defended his reputation his mother said he never would have jeopardized his dream job his wife offered stacks of unpaid bills to show they were not living extravagantly his fatherinlaw called him one of the good guys and robert boone , who used to fix up old cars with mr adams , said his friend simply could not have hidden his drug use i trusted tommy , and i still do i do n't believe he did it , said mr boone , whose house was among those that ms kearbey told the authorities she robbed at the direction of mr adams did he get caught up in something he could n't get out of \? maybe maybe according to the long investigation by state and federal authorities , though , mr adams had been using methamphetamine for at least nine months with a man who had become a government informant last month , the unidentified informant , wearing a wire , went to mr adams s cabin to buy methamphetamine from the sheriff , who used some in his presence , according to a court document mr adams was quickly arrested , and his bail was set at 250 , 000 despite initially boasting that he could pay immediately , he remains in jail it seems like they always get caught up in it , said david reynolds , raising his voice above the scream of a blade at his familyowned saw mill a sheriff do n't have to answer to nobody
florham park , nj the wildcat may be perceived as a trick play , but as jeremy kerley intimated recently , there is no trickery involved when shonn greene receives the direct snap we would n't use shonn to try to hit the outside , kerley said no , want greene running between the tackles , using his 235pound body as a wrecking ball they want to see defenders on their backs , casualties of his punishing style they want first downs and touchdowns and victories running out of the wildcat or not , greene has fulfilled all the jets' hopes and expectations during a threegame surge that has revitalized their season it has also revitalized his own during the streak , which has propelled the jets from playoff pretenders to legitimate contenders , greene has rushed for 295 yards , averaging 50 per carry , and 4 touchdowns , none more emblematic of his transformation than his 7yard burst in the second quarter against kansas city on sunday taking the handoff from mark sanchez , greene zipped left , leaped over a flailing brandon carr and then lowered his right shoulder to plow through kendrick lewis at the 3yard line before strutting into the end zone that s what i'm supposed to do , greene said you have to have the mentality that nothing s going to stop you the jets have seen that mentality from greene in spurts , but not consistently since naming him in training camp as the featured running back for two years , greene waited behind thomas jones and ladainian tomlinson for that opportunity for six weeks , that opportunity produced frustration , as greene wondered what more he could do things were tough in the beginning they were , greene said you just had to keep working and believing they would get better a turning point came before the oct 9 game against new england , when the jets aborted their plans to expand their offense , turning instead to the rushingbased attack that fueled their ascension to the past two afc championship games sometimes it just does n't click maybe when you think it will , coach said one reason was an inconsistent offensive line , which struggled during center nick mangold s twogame absence , and again in consecutive losses to new england and denver in midnovember the line responded by dominating the line of scrimmage against buffalo and in washington before clearing the way for greene s 127 yards against the chiefs in highlighting the team s play like a jet moments from sunday s game , ryan on wednesday singled out santonio holmes s blocking on greene s 31yard run , the jets' first offensive play holmes cleared space for greene by blasting safety jon mcgraw , then running downfield to knock away cornerback brandon flowers guard matt slauson said , those are the blocks that go from a 4 or 5yard gain to a 20yard gain those runs require patience , an important virtue in the jets' zoneblocking scheme to that end , greene has worked at practice with the running backs coach anthony lynn on finding what he called his aiming point , the hole that appears when patience is exercised once it opens , the offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer said recently , you have to accelerate through it greene s next challenge comes against a philadelphia defense that has struggled to defend against the run , allowing at least 138 yards six times this season , including a high of 174 to seattle on dec 1 greene has also emerged as an important component in the screenpassing game , which is particularly useful against teams with strong pass rushes a 36yard screen play , helped by superb downfield blocking by mangold , set up the jets' second touchdown against kansas city the eagles had nine sacks last week against miami , and the jets realize the advantage in gaining chunks of yards on first and second downs to avoid obvious passing situations with colder weather settling in , the jets are glad to have a running back of greene s size , someone who is difficult to bring down ryan said , those are the guys that can take the pounding and they also dish it out extra points defensive end mike devito , who missed the last two games with a sprained knee , returned to practice wednesday and is expected to play sunday against philadelphia

some years ago , one of my neighbors , an migr russian engineer , offered an observation about his adopted country america seems very rich , he said , but i never see anyone actually making anything that was a bit unfair , but not completely and as time went by it became increasingly accurate by the middle years of the last decade , i used to joke that americans made a living by selling each other houses , which they paid for with money borrowed from china manufacturing , once america s greatest strength , seemed to be in terminal decline but that may be changing manufacturing is one of the bright spots of a generally disappointing recovery , and there are signs preliminary , but hopeful , nonetheless that a sustained comeback may be under way and there s something else you should know if rightwing critics of efforts to rescue the economy had gotten their way , this comeback would n't be happening the story so far in the 1990s , us manufacturing employment was more or less steady after 2000 , however , it entered a steep decline the 2001 recession hit industry hard , while the bubblefueled expansion of the decade s middle years an expansion marked by a huge rise in the trade deficit left manufacturing behind by december 2007 , there were 35 million fewer us manufacturing workers than there had been in 2000 millions more jobs disappeared in the slump that followed only a handful of these lost jobs have come back , so far but , as i said , there are indications of a turnaround crucially , the manufacturing trade deficit seems to be coming down at this point , it s only about half as large as a share of gdp as it was at the peak of the housing bubble , and further improvements are in the pipeline the boston consulting group , which is now predicting a us manufacturing renaissance , points to major us firms like caterpillar that once shifted production abroad but are now moving it back at the same time , companies from other countries , especially european firms , are moving production to america and one potential disaster has been avoided the us auto industry , which many people were writing off just two years ago , has weathered the storm in particular , general motors has now had five consecutive profitable quarters america s industrial heartland is now leading the economic recovery in august 2009 , michigan had an unemployment rate of 141 percent , the highest in the nation today , that rate is down to 103 percent , still above the national average , but nonetheless a huge improvement i do n't want to suggest that everything is wonderful about us manufacturing so far , the job gains are modest , and many new manufacturing jobs do n't offer good pay or benefits the manufacturing revival is n't going to make health reform unnecessary or obviate the need for a strong social safety net still , better to have those jobs than none at all which brings me to those rightwing critics first , what s driving the turnaround in our manufacturing trade \? the main answer is that the us dollar has fallen against other currencies , helping give usbased manufacturing a cost advantage a weaker dollar , it turns out , was just what us industry needed yet the federal reserve finds itself under intense pressure from the right to make the dollar stronger , not weaker a few months ago , paul ryan , the chairman of the house budget committee , berated ben bernanke for failing to tighten monetary policy , declaring there is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens than debase its currency if mr bernanke had given in to that kind of pressure , manufacturing would have continued its relentless decline and then there s the matter of the auto industry , which probably would have imploded if president obama had n't stepped in to rescue general motors and chrysler for those companies would almost surely have gone into liquidation , closing all their factories and this liquidation would have undermined the rest of america s auto industry , as essential suppliers went under , too hundreds of thousands of jobs were at stake yet mr obama was fiercely denounced for taking action one republican congressman declared the auto rescue part of the administration s war on capitalism another insisted that when government gets involved in a company , the disaster that follows is predictable not so much , it turns out so while we still have a deeply troubled economy , one piece of good news is that americans are , once again , starting to actually make things and we 're doing that thanks , in large part , to the fact that the fed and the obama administration ignored very bad advice from rightwingers ideologues who still , in the face of all the evidence , claim to know something about creating prosperity
an exhibition of ancient chinese artifacts will go forward at the university of pennsylvania museum of archeology and anthropology , after all the exhibition , secrets of the silk road , which includes materials , including two mummies , recently excavated at desert burial sites in western china , was organized by the bowers museum in santa ana , calif , and was shown there last year and subsequently at the houston museum of natural science , where it closed on jan 2 it was scheduled to open at the penn museum on february 5 , but last week , three days before the planned opening , the museum announced that china had requested that none of the artifacts be displayed as a result , the museum would only show photographs , multimedia presentations , and a recreation of an excavation site it offered refunds to those who had bought advance tickets and said that the exhibition would now be free the problem now seems to have been crossed signals between the museum and the chinese government , in which the museum was approved as a venue by regional officials but not , as required , by the central authorities in beijing the philadelphia inquirer on thursday quoted a spokesman for the chinese embassy , wang baodong , saying that the central government had only approved the show going to santa ana and houston now the museum has reached an agreement with china that will allow the exhibition to proceed with the artifacts on view , although they will be displayed for a much shorter period than originally planned the modified exhibition will close on sunday to allow for the installation of the full show , which will open on february 18 and run , complete , through march 15 it will then continue until march 28 with all of the artifacts except for the two mummies to make up for the limited duration of the exhibition \( which was originally scheduled to run through june \) , the museum will be open seven days a week for extended hours , including until 9 pm on wednesday , friday , saturday and sunday in an interview , mr wang said that the regulations governing the display of antiquities in china are very strict , and artifacts are not supposed to be on display overseas for more than a year \( the exhibition opened at the bowers museum last march \) the exhibition was originally approved to be on display for only two stops , one in california , the other in houston , mr wang said however , after repeated requests from the university of pennsylvania , beijing had decided to grant it special approval what was important , he said , was that americans understand they have to follow china s rules we just want the american public to know we have the relevant laws and the regulations , he said you 've got to follow the laws , he added a museum spokeswoman , pam kosty , declined to comment on the nature of the original mixup with the chinese government , but said , we 're very grateful for the chinese embassy a lot of chinese officials really worked with us to make this happen this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo \( photograph by jae c hong associated press \)
a strange combination of chaos and parity hit the second round of the pga championship on friday , with a decidedly nonstarstudded leader board in a nearconstant shuffle all afternoon at atlanta athletic club when the dust had settled , the unheralded duo of justin dufner and keegan bradley shared the lead at five under par after a relatively uninteresting morning of golfers going nowhere in the second round of the pga championship , the play in the afternoon heated up along with the temperatures even the seemingly unflappable firstround leader , steve stricker , got caught up in the chaos after having torn apart the atlanta athletic club course with no bogeys in his firstround 63 , stricker was suddenly wobbling everywhere he was not driving the ball that poorly , but missing makeable putts and his four bogeys offset by a single birdie in his first nine holes sent him falling backward from seven under to four under in what seemed like only a few eye blinks he finished the day at three under scott verplank , who started his round four shots behind stricker , drained a long birdie putt on no 8 for his third of the day and it gave him the lead at six under he promptly gave a shot back by missing a twofoot putt for par on no 9 two more bogeys on the back nine , with one birdie , left the door open for dufner and bradley , who were both in the clubhouse with excellent rounds dufner poured in a birdie on his final hole the much lesspunishing no 9 to shoot a 65 dufner , 34 , has never won a pro tournament but did finish tied for fifth at last year s pga bradley had the best round of the day , a sixunder 64 that included six birdies and no bogeys bradley , a 25yearold rookie , won his first pro tournament in may in his attempt to become known for more than being lpga hall of famer pat bradley s nephew a group at four under had included adam scott of australia who was knocking shots stiff and reeling off four birdies in 12 holes before he stalled but scott ran into major trouble at the super difficult no 18 he splashed his approach shot into the water next to the green and took a double bogey to finish two under that left verplank , stricker , brandt jobe , john senden and jim furyk tied at four under with da points , whose morninground 67 made him one of the few who made headway in the early going he had reached five under until no 18 claimed its latest victim and he finished up with a bogey tiger woods , who needed a magical round to make the cut after his hideous firstround implosion , found only more trouble he had backtoback double bogeys giving him an astounding five for the tournament to leave him 11 over par he finished 10 over after a round of 73 the projected cut is at four over by lynn zinser keegan bradley , riding a wave of confidence in his rookie season after winning his first pro tournament in may , could hardly believe his good fortune in the second round of the pga his sixunder 64 featured not a single bogey i just played spectacularly , said bradley , who is 25 and most importantly , i putted the ball great i stayed out of trouble but i also made some great putts for par as for winning a major in his rookie season , he said , it would be just incredible , but i ve got two long , hard days ahead of me lz after his dreadful showing at the pga left him at 10 over par and ridiculously far from the cut line , tiger woods sounded upbeat at his postround news conference missing the cut , he said , meant , i ll get some time off again now i m healthy and i can work on my game it s a step back as far as not contending in this tournament but it s a giant step forward that i played two straight weeks healthy it s a good sign that i can hit the ball exactly the way i want i just didn t do it enough times on golf s current parity , and those who might complain about the lack of star power , jason dufner said i would say to them that there s a lot of good guys out here that s one thing that i ve learned , this is my sixth year out here , there s tons and tons of guys that can play golf out here the networks and the media maybe focus on bigger names for a reason that s who people want to see people want to see tiger woods , people want to see phil mickelson but there s other guys that can really , really play golf out here and that are really good that you ve never heard of having finished fifth in last year s pga , jason dufner feels like he belongs high on the leader board at atlanta athletic club a victory , though , would also be his first pro victory as far as winning a major , that would probably be the most meaningful thing to me in my career so far since i ve never won anything , dufner said it would be pretty amazing for the first win to be a major i came pretty close last year at whistling straits i had a reasonable chance going into the last nine holes to catch those guys i think i missed the playoff by two shots i don t want to say that i ve been there like a lot of guys , but i ve had a taste of some opportunities to win some tournaments with the top of the leader board crowded with older \( if generally unaccomplished in majors \) golfers , keegan bradley represents the next wave he is 25 , just turned pro this year and won the byron nelson championship in may for his first pro victory but , any flicker of recognition of his name is probably because his aunt is lpga hall of famer pat bradley lz it is safe to say a leader board of scott verplank , keegan bradley , jason dufner , da points and co , is not what cbs had in mind to grab people s attention for the weekend s rounds they would all be lovely stories as a firsttime major winner , but golf has had plenty of lovely little stories lately and it is not doing great things for ratings that s why tiger woods is getting as much airtime as anyone this afternoon when he is nine over par lz jason duffner was one of the lucky ones not to finish up on the back nine , so he could use a birdie on his final hole no 9 to jump into a tie for the lead at five under with steve stricker and scott verplank lz most of the players clustered high on the leader board started their rounds on the front nine , which means they will be battling the course s toughest holes coming down the stretch that means none of them will be able to relax for a second adam scott , who went into no 18 the toughest of the tough holes at four under , plunked his approach shot in the water alongside the green and took a painful double bogey should scott verplank and steve stricker be battling for the lead when this round comes to the end , it will be a test of which one blinks on those closing holes lz with steve stricker finally wobbling a short par putt miss on no 9 was his fourth bogey of the round it left the door open for a group of golfers who were lurking behind him for awhile , it was adam scott who was the hottest of the potential leaders , but he had a bogey after driving into a bunker on 14 , and he settled with stricker at four under scott verplank was the one who stepped into the void , draining a long birdie putt on no 8 for his third birdie and grabbing the lead to himself at six under lz after his two birdies put a dose of hope in his round , tiger woods took the scenic route around no 11 with an errant drive , a bad bunker shot , a missed green and a double bogey back at nine over , woods has lost his grip again lz perhaps he was so disgusted by his putt on no 7 that he figured he could not get any worse , but tiger woods found something to spur him from an otherwise desultory round he had birdies on each of the next two holes the one on no 9 came after a 10footer for birdie and fought back to seven over at midround lz davis love iii did not get very comfortable at four under on the very next hole , he could not sink a parsaving putt and gave a stroke back he looked like he might keep backing up , but on no 9 , he drained a 12footer to save par and stay at three under lz davis love iii used birdies at nos 5 and 7 to push himself to four under , which is a tie for second with da points , adam scott and jerry kelly perhaps love , 47 , is just trying to make the 44yearold steve stricker feel young the tnt analysts just said love is playing in his 91st major lz tiger woods seems to have lost any hope of playing his way into relevance he hit a par putt on no 7 that was as gruesome as you could imagine woods hitting it barely made it halfway to the hole he was walking toward it as soon as he finished his swing his second bogey of the round put him nine over lz from da points s postround interview i actually started out on the range this morning panicking because i wasn t hitting it very well , and fortunately , i kind of figured it out right at the end of my warmup , and i got out and hit an okay driver off the first hole that kind of hung in the fairway , and then i hit a great 6iron from about 190 yards to about six feet and made that so that was gave me a little boost of confidence knowing that i think i kind of figured out my golf swing and then i got to no 4 , and shoot , i don t even hardly remember what did i hit \? that s how much in the moment i am , right \? i can t even remember what i hit on no 3 , leader steve stricker appeared to be headed toward another routine hole when his first putt ended up nowhere near the hole his par putt then traveled threequarters of the way around the hole and slid out it was stricker s first bogey of the tournament and dropped him to six under lz that approach into the bunker was a really bad turn woods blasted it out way past the hole and missed the long par putt that slides him to eight over lz having to make a good deal of headway in this round , tiger woods is not mustering any he has actually driven the ball respectably , for a change , but even with short irons to the greens has not been able to make a birdie happen on the par5 no 5 , he had a short third shot from the fairway and plunked it in a bunker lz so far , steve stricker hasn t seemed to be affected by the pressure of his firstround lead the first two holes have produced two routine pars lz da points said the key to keeping himself high on the leader board was avoiding any adventure on the atlanta athletic club course he said the heat was not much of a factor the condition of the golf course is great , he said it s just a very demanding golf course the first and second rounds have been the best i ve struck the ball all year , which is what you need to do out here tiger woods got through his first three holes with three pars , which is better than what happened to him for most of his first round , but he started well in that too before falling apart problem for woods is , he s going to have to catch some people to make the cut lz the worst part about brandt snedeker taking a twoshot penalty for being late for his 8 10 am tee time was that snedeker had been at the course since 6 30 he didn t oversleep or get caught in traffic i thought my tee time was 8 20 and it was at 8 10 , he said that s the first time that s happened in my career , and i guarantee it ll be my last it s very frustrating , to say the least snedeker shot a threeover 73 to finish at seven over and will miss the cut lz after his threeover 73 which featured a triple bogey on the par3 no 17 rory mcilroy said his injured wrist was feeling better than thursday , but it never left his mind it feels ok , mcilroy said it was a little tough mentally because you re trying to protect it during the swing when the final sand had settled on his maddening round , shaun micheel had trouble making sense of it he had started the day at four under and within sight of the lead but two double bogeys , eight bogeys , two birdies and an eagle later , he was four over it was just a frustrating day , micheel said i m more mad , really , at the mistakes that i made i didn t play a great round of golf , but i made enough mistakes that i cost myself basically four shots today , and those are difficult to swallow i can handle bad shots , but just the mental mistakes , i mean , those just kill you you know , again , the eagle , hopefully that keeps me around for the weekend if i get to play , i guess i ll look at it like i shot 72 72 instead of 66 78 i ll have to just change my mindset and figure it out tomorrow because if you can hit the ball in the fairway you can score , and i didn t deserve that and i didn t deserve to have a good round as tiger woods gets ready to tee off , trying to make the cut after shooting a sevenover 77 in the first round , it s worth noting that woods has missed the cut only three times in 60 majors , and one of those missed cuts was in 1996 when he was 20 and still an amateur right now , the cut is projected at four over lz defending pga champion martin kaymer of germany left the course with almost no hope of playing the weekend after his secondround 73 , he was five over for the tournament he said he had no bad feelings about the course or defending his title , but just could not make a move it s just nothing went in , he said i hit every green in regulation on the back nine and i just made one putt and it was on the last hole i was in good position , but it didn t happen it was a frustrating day i just tried to keep fighting until the end because you never know what s going to happen it s a tough finish here the last four holes , so maybe you could pick up a couple shots but overall it was a frustrating tournament because nothing went my way da points got through the tough par3 no 15 with a par no easy holes ahead though lz after a casualtyfree thursday , the second round is taking its toll on players retief goosen became the third withdrawal he weathered 10 holes , then cut short his day at three over par after a fiveover 75 in the opening round goosen blamed illness mt da points kept his good round going with a birdie on the par5 no 12 to reach five under , but he does have the course s toughest holes ahead of him nos 15 and 18 no 18 s carnage has reached 33 double bogeys or worse , 68 bogeys and 13 birdies lz there is very little movement on the leader board perhaps fitting on a day when no one would want to move in the heat with da points being the only one to jump into the top page with his threeunder round \( through 11 holes \) shaun micheel , however , has done enough moving for several players when we last visited , he had dropped nine shots for the day but he got two back with an eagle on the par5 no 5 that puts him at three over and with a chance of making the cut lz right now , the projected cut line sits at four over , and there are some notable players currently on the wrong side of it darren clarke \( 11 over \) , graeme mcdowell \( seven over \) , dustin johnson \( six over \) , ernie els \( six over \) and that s just from the morning group tiger woods is seven over and doesn t tee off until 1 45 pm last year s pga champion , martin kaymer , will almost assuredly not be playing this weekend he is six over through 14 holes of his second round but will have to stick around to crown a new champion lz shaun micheel , a former pga champion , is currently enduring the day s worst round he started the day at four under and within sight of the lead , but has dropped nine shots in 12 holes on two double bogeys , six bogeys and one birdie at five over , he has slid well under the projected cut line lz rory mcilroy got through no 18 with a par , which is no small feat so far in the tournament , that hole has bedeviled golfers for 32 double bogeys or worse , 62 bogeys and only 13 birdies lz rocco mediate pulled out of the tournament with an undisclosed injury , the second player to withdraw friday the defections proved too late for paul goydos , the first alternate who hung around all day thursday before leaving when all 156 players answered the bell mt rory mcilroy was looking strong in his round , despite his injured wrist , but noninjury disaster struck on no 17 he plunked his tee shot into the water and threeputted for triple bogey that sent him from one under to two over charl schwartzel , playing in the same group , followed mcilroy s lead almost exactly , but got away with a twoputt double bogey to fall to one over ouch lz players started gathering steam pun intended and making a push up the leader board toward the leader , steve stricker , who tees off at 2 15 with his sevenunder mark anders hansen of denmark , trevor immelman of south africa and the americans da points and ricky barnes have all pushed to three under lz brandt snedeker left the course thursday at four over par but teed off friday at six over what happened \? tardiness can be costly , especially in golf he showed up for his 8 10 am tee time at 8 12 the pga , sticklers for punctuality , assessed him a twostroke penalty mt when played at full length , the par3 no 15 is 260 yards , the longest par3 in pga championship history but it got a bit shorter friday it is playing 236 to the hole of course , they didn t do anything to move that water along the right of the green , so no one will consider it easy lz another 90degree day awaits the field , which would seem to be a disadvantage to the madison , wis , residents steve stricker and jerry kelly yet , they began the second round in first and second place stricker , in fact , has been known to hit balls in december while standing in snow just outside his house mt shaun micheel , the 2003 pga championship winner , did not start off well after his excellent first round of 66 two bogeys on his first two holes nos 10 and 11 , which were birdie holes thursday for a lot of contenders got him started in the wrong direction he righted himself with a birdie on the par5 no 12 , but another bogey on the par3 no 15 has dropped him back to two under lz darren clarke did not exactly carry momentum out of his british open victory in july he has admitted the emotions that came with that victory sidetracked his concentration on golf at the pga , he seems to be along for the stroll , playing with his fellow northern irishman rory mcilroy through four holes of his second round , he is nine over lz of the earliest groups on the golf course , the only golfer making a notable move on the leader board was mike small , a club pro from illinois , who was two under par after four holes that moved small , the golf coach at the university of illinois and a good friend of steve stricker s , to one over par for the championship bill pennington the tournament had its first withdrawal , and it was not the sorewristed rory mcilroy jb holmes , the tour s longest driver , pulled out citing an undisclosed illness after shooting an 80 in the first round thursday holmes has been struggling on tour lately , with missed cuts in his two previous events mike tierney

philadelphia a long , emotional sunday night came to a happy conclusion on monday morning for the , who beat the , 21 , in 14 innings in a game that became a backdrop for the nation s reaction to the news of the death of osama bin laden amid chants of usa , usa from the sellout crowd of 45 , 713 at citizens bank park , the mets and the phillies played their elongated game as word of the events quickly percolated throughout the stadium , but the players were seemingly the last to know third baseman was standing on second base during one of the chants in the ninth inning he and phillies second baseman pete orr did n't know what the chanting was about until later i do n't like to give the philly fans too much credit , he said , but they got this one right it s a proud moment to stand out there and you 've got 4550 thousand people chanting that was pretty special the mets have always felt a connection to the sept 11 attacks many members of the team in 2001 were involved in supporting the rescue efforts also , on friday , the team went to walter reed army medical center in washington and visited wounded veterans one of the first things i thought about was coming from walter reed , wright said , the emotions that those guys must be going through hearing that same news as proud and as great a moment it was for me being on a baseball field , you multiply that by a million that s probably what they 're feeling at the fire houses , the police stations , at the places like walter reed it s just an incredible moment the mets made it an ever better evening by winning the game ronny paulino , making his first start for the mets and playing in only his second game for the team since coming off the disabled list friday , had a careerhigh five hits , including the gamewinning double off kyle kendrick wright scored from third base with two outs in the 14th inning as the mets ended a threegame losing streak the mets went into the 14th having stranded 16 base runners they had gone 0 for 14 with runners in scoring position before paulino s hit they used all of their position players and six pitchers , and the phillies used pitcher cole hamels to pinchhit in the 14th inning of a game that took 4 hours 44 minutes and did n't conclude until 12 53 monday morning chris young , who has been the mets' ace of sorts this season , outpitched cliff lee in a seveninning duel , but the phillies came back against the mets' bullpen , scoring once in the eighth to tie it but then francisco rodriguez pitched a clean inning and a third , and pedro beato pitched three scoreless extra innings in relief , giving mets hitters time to score the mets had seven scoreless innings after scoring their run in the fifth off lee , when carlos beltran doubled in wright young , pitching for the second time since returning from the disabled list with biceps tendinitis in his right shoulder , confounded the phillies he allowed only two hits , none after the fourth inning , and struck out seven it was a tense game throughout , and word of the death of bin laden began to circulate around the same time that the phillies began staging their comeback it began in the eighth against jason isringhausen , who walked the first batter he faced , john mayberry jr shane victorino sacrificed him over to second and then placido polanco hit a popup into shallow right field jose reyes had to run for the ball , which popped out of his glove , before he secured it but isringhausen , who struggled with his command on saturday , too , walked jimmy rollins , bringing the slugger ryan howard to the plate mets manager terry collins called on his only lefthander in the bullpen , tim byrdak , who had stranded all eight of his inherited runners coming into the game but howard went the other way on a pitch , slapping it into left field , and mayberry jr scored from second base to tie the score collins then called on rodriguez , his closer , who walked ben francisco but got the struggling raul ibanez , who was hitless in his previous 33 atbats , to ground out to end the inning with his former pitching coach and mentor orel hershiser , an espn broadcaster , at the game , young was superb using slow and slower breaking balls , some of which measured 71 miles per hour on the radar gun , young was able to keep the phillies off balance through six innings he had faced only two batters over the minimum , and after a leadoff single by polanco in the fourth , he set down 10 consecutive phillies young s only difficulty came in the seventh inning , when the phillies had the bases loaded and two outs but young got out of it with the assistance of the thirdbase umpire lance barksdale , who ruled brian schneider , batting 077 coming into the game , had swung for strike three with one out , young walked howard and then hit francisco with a pitch ibanez struck out , which was not surprising considering his prolonged slump but young walked second baseman pete orr on a full count then schneider tried unsuccessfully to pull up on a 22 pitch , a 75mph slider when the mets appealed to barksdale , he made the call in their favor to end the inning phillies manager charlie manuel ran all the way out to shallow left field , where barksdale was standing between innings , to argue , and was eventually ejected before exiting , manuel pulled lee from the game after he had thrown 113 pitches , 78 of which were strikes he allowed only one run and eight hits , and he walked two over seven innings like young , he did not figure in the decision there were indications in the first inning that lee might not be at his best he walked two and gave up a leadoff double to reyes , and he required 34 pitches to get out of the inning inside pitch catcher ronny paulino threw out ben francisco as he tried to steal in the 10th , ending the inning terry collins said the mets expected pitcher johan santana to start throwing off a mound within the next two weeks once that happens , santana could be six to eight weeks away from returning , barring setbacks santana , who had surgery on his right shoulder last september , has been throwing from 150 feet in his rehabilitation program
cairo the worshipers erupted , hundreds of them , loudly chanting no ! no ! no ! and drowning out the priest , making it impossible for him to continue offering thanks to president  it was two days after a as a mass was ending in alexandria , and the coptic christian church leadership had assumed its standard posture as ally of the president , loyal institution of the state we direct our thanks to the president , the priest said during a mass but this time the parishioners would have none of it no ! no ! no ! we want our rights ! and remove the governor ! they shouted during the ceremony the bomb attack exposed a between s christian minority and its muslim majority but it also revealed disagreements within the christian population , and within the church , too an increasingly conservative and restive segment of the population expressed frustration with the church leadership s nonconfrontational approach to the state and its reluctance to aggressively challenge practices seen as discriminatory , churchgoers , politicians and political scientists said yousry matta , who witnessed the attack outside the saints church in alexandria , was critical of the leader of the coptic orthodox church , saying pope shenouda always plays politics with our situation he must act to get help for us from the outside , and instead he just says that in egypt we are all brothers when something bad happens he just stays quiet but concern was also expressed by a smaller , quieter segment of the community that the church had taken too prominent a role in representing egypt s christians in the first place , reinforcing the sectarian divide and the notion that coptic christians are christians first , and egyptians second when the pope refers to the christian people , ' i reject that , said mona makramebeid , a former member of parliament from a prominent christian family the word people implies a nation , separate and apart , she said samir morqos , a researcher and intellectual who asked to be described as an egyptian rather than a coptic christian , said if we start talking about the role of the church , then we are accepting the idea of the copts as a religious community , but it s about time that we start to look at this issue in a different way we have to see them as part of society and address their issues and provide solutions through the civil state cairo was quiet on friday , the coptic christian christmas but after , many people said that the calm was merely a lull and that the troubles , if not addressed , would soon reemerge since the bomb attack , church leaders have responded primarily by addressing the criticism of the larger , louder , angrier group of constituents , thousands of whom took to the streets in protests , chanting slogans against the government and , in some cases , calling for the church to be more responsive , too pope shenouda iii appeared on state television on tuesday and in unusually blunt terms urged the government to address discrimination , to confront the problems of the copts and try to resolve them although the pope remains a largely respected figure , his words did little to cool the anger protesters defied pleas to stay off the streets and called on their leadership to drop its diplomatic approach , a prospect that the church leaders made clear would not happen because it would in the end only intensify the problem , church officials said there is something that upsets me from the church , said atef marzouq , a clerk in a shoe store in shoubra , a neighborhood in cairo , as he watched angry young protesters being corralled in the street by riot police officers on wednesday i do n't like the statements they make they keep saying we are brothers , we are brothers' so i get beat up and then you tell me he is my brother \? i want honesty i want honest and resolute statements but political experts and current and former government officials said the church , like any other institution in egypt , struggled merely to survive in an authoritarian state , where president mubarak and his political allies have a monopoly on power the state has at times allowed individual constituencies , like the banned muslim brotherhood , to have a voice , but with the goal of coopting them rather than empowering them , said political experts and intellectuals , including members of the governing party at the same time , pope shenouda is unlikely to stand up to the state given his history , instead working to win gains by appearing loyal , experts in the church said in 1981 , pope shenouda defied the president at the time , anwar elsadat , and as a result was removed from his position and exiled to a monastery for nearly three and a half years there is no independence in the church anymore , said ms makramebeid , the former member of parliament that is what they think is necessary for survival , to be coopted it is a defense mechanism but church representatives suggested that the issue had less to do with independence than with pragmatic considerations i am emphasizing the young men should not follow those who incite , the rev antonious tawfik said during christmas mass from the pulpit of the same church in shoubra where days earlier demonstrators stood chanting for the church to listen nobody should go out in a demonstration or a march , and he who does will subject himself to the reach of the law
groesbeck , tex whoever was stealing cattle had to have some cowboy in him , the theory went you could tell by the seamless way he could lure more than a dozen animals at a time out of their pens , onto his trailer and into the endless texas night , like some pied piper of bovines this was not the handiwork of some crack addict , risking a kick to the addled head for the low yield of a heifer or two this was a cow whisperer , cattle people told themselves one of us the reports started piling up across south and east texas on march 15 , for example , 26 calves vanished from a sale barn in the houston county town of crockett the same night that a livestock trailer was stolen in neighboring walker county on may 3 , 18 head of cattle disappeared from a sale barn in milam county two nights later and 160 miles away , 28 head went missing from a sale barn in nacogdoches county enough was enough these cattle did n't just wander off to take in the night air on may 6 , hal dumas , a special ranger for the unique texas and southwestern cattle raisers association part industry advocate , part law enforcement agency joined the milam county sheriff in sending out a beonthelookout alert , telling ranching communities everywhere of the rustler among them locations are being hit in the early morning hours suspects will probably be hauling a long gooseneck trailer between midnight and 3 30 am the stolen cattle are generally calves weighing between 350 and 500 pounds though the vigilante , string'emup response to cattle rustling has faded into the sepiatoned past , livestock theft still carries the whiff of the lowdown cur in the last decade , special rangers for the cattle raisers association investigated more than 11 , 000 cases of livestockrelated thefts , and recovered or accounted for more than 37 , 500 head of cattle stealing a cow is like stealing a factory , ranchers say , given that a healthy , breeding cow can return dividends for years some ranchers even grow fond of the animals they raise , no matter how abruptly these relationships may end at the stockyard gate most of all , livestock are living bonds of communal trust precious things of value , grazing close to the road and when ranchers are ready to sell , they often unload their cattle into the easily accessible pens of sale barns a day or two before auction the barn might have a security camera or a night watchman then again , it might not still , you can trust your mother , but cut the cards that is why the 15 , 000member cattle raisers association , founded in 1877 by a band of rustlerweary ranchers , has 29 special rangers , including mr dumas , all with the power of arrest , all wearing guns and white hats using sophisticated databases \( including a file of more than 100 , 000 registered brands \) and plain common sense \( checking cow pies for tire tracks \) , these rangers investigate thefts of livestock and property and inspect millions of cattle a year the rangers have the respect of cattle rustlers they know this because a rustler said so a few years ago , they helped to pen jerome heath novak , a clever , cleancut cattle rustler from a proud ranching family in brazoria county who was so audacious in his nighttime thefts that he even stole livestock from nolan ryan , the baseball legend and texas icon he was caught only after taking to auction a stolen calf with a distinctive barbedwire scar , which someone noticed before being sent to prison , a remorseful mr novak , then 27 , sat down with rangers to help them understand the mind of the cattle rustler he confessed to not liking sale barns with motion lights or people living on site , and said he avoided ranches and sale barns that had the cattle raisers association s blue membership sign on display i tried to keep away from that because it s a band of members that will hold together and push the issue , said mr novak , who goes by heath someone else is there , behind them , backing them up when he was done explaining , one of the rangers asked the larger question why \? why , heath \? the rangers could establish a rapport with the likes of mr novak because many of them are also ranchers they gather much of their intelligence by working cattle in the pastures , chatting up muckstained employees in sale barns and asking ranchers what they 're hearing mr dumas , 58 , the supervisor for 44 counties with 14 million cattle , began one recent day by helping randy sullivan , a sunbaked rancher in robertson county , gather some cattle into a pen thick with flies , then sort out calves for shipping the cowboys on horseback clicked tongues and shouted heyhah ! the cows twitched tails and lowed in anxious response the cowboys paused under the leaden sky for a cold drink , with mr sullivan apologizing for not having any rc cola talk soon turned to the recent spate of cattle rustling you feel kind of violated , said mr sullivan , 54 , his jagged face shiny with perspiration mr dumas returned his horse , colonel , to his paddock in franklin , then drove his pickup to an auction at a sale barn in groesbeck , where , a few months earlier , eight black calves vanished overnight he ate a hamburger in the barn s small restaurant , heard a snatch of the auctioneer s livestock song , chatted with the local sheriff , then walked the perimeter to demonstrate the rustler s probable modus operandi the theory the thief pulled his trailer up to the pen late at night , after the last worker had gone home opened the two iron gates and chained them to the mouth of his trailer whooped the calves through the makeshift chute and into his trailer , and drove off with 4 , 000 pounds of cow worth about 4 , 800 probably took two minutes , mr dumas said , his face shaded by his palmleaf white hat and how is this behavior viewed by those who work and live cattle \? cody de cordova , 30 , whose family owns a sale barn in nearby buffalo , spat into the dirt , said that hanging was proper punishment and gave no facial indication that he might be kidding last month , four days after mr dumas sent out the cattlerustler alert , the brazoria county sheriff s department received a report of a portable corral containing three dozen calves in a field where they did not belong a responding deputy pulled up just as a cowboy was loading the calves onto a trailer the cowboy did not have any paperwork attesting to his ownership of the calves chris dubois , an investigator for the sheriff s department , said that none of his answers were making any sense other than , perhaps , his name jerome heath novak mr novak , now 32 , was indicted last week on charges of once again breaking the communal bond , in a case that once again has investigators asking why why , heath \?
millersville , md when jerome ndayishimiye entered the overheated room at the nursing home where his 58yearold mother lay under a tightly tucked blanket , he quickly closed the curtains around her bed and turned on her boom box so that a melodic rwandan song enveloped them he stroked her forehead and her eyes fluttered open and closed again at this point , i do not know whether to say hello or goodbye , mr ndayishimiye said saturday , choosing instead to ask her softly , in their native language , how she was feeling she stirred again but did not answer rachel nyirahabiyambere , a legal immigrant from rwanda , has been in a persistent vegetative state since having a major in april on feb 19 , ms nyirahabiyambere s feeding tube was removed on the order of her courtappointed guardian her six adult children including two united states citizens vehemently opposed that decision but they were helpless to block it when , frustrated in its efforts to discharge ms nyirahabiyambere after she had spent eight costly months there without insurance , sought a guardian to make decisions that the family would not make now we are powerless spectators , just watching our mother die , said mr ndayishimiye , 33 , who teaches health information management at the in utica in our culture , we would never sentence a person to die from hunger decisionmaking on behalf of patients in persistent vegetative states is always a delicate matter , especially if , like ms nyirahabiyambere , they have not left a directive her case , which has received no public attention , underscores the thorny issues that arise when a severely braindamaged person s life is sustained by medical technology with thousands in persistent vegetative states , the issues regularly surface in and courtrooms what constitutes futile care , what power should doctors or lawyers have to stop treatment and what role should financial considerations play in ms nyirahabiyambere s case , her status adds another layer of complexity with less than five years in this country , she is ineligible for the coverage that would have paid for her to live indefinitely with a feeding tube in a nursing home as her children see it , her life is being cut short because she is an indigent immigrant it s all about money , mr ndayishimiye said but her guardian , andrea j sloan , said that prolonging the life of someone profoundly vegetative would be questionable even if insurance were available because palliative care is more appropriate the essential question of the feeding tube has nothing to do with nationality or payor source , she said arthur caplan , director of the at the university of pennsylvania , said the case underscores that endoflife decisions have to be treated with great sensitivity and , ideally , with families fully involved and respected he added any hint that withdrawing treatment might be linked to financial considerations that s a huge ethical nono that s death panel stuff during the debate on the health care overhaul , after a proposal to encourage endoflife planning provoked a furor over what opponents termed death panels , president obama promised that his program would not pull the plug on grandma now covers voluntary advance care planning , which proponents see as protecting patients' autonomy before her stroke , ms nyirahabiyambere took medication for but otherwise appeared healthy , her sons said family pictures show a youthful , smiley grandmother wrapped in a fishpatterned african skirt , carrying a grandson in a matching baby sling she had been an elementary school teacher for most of three decades in butare , rwanda when the rwandan civil war broke out in 1994 , ms nyirahabiyambere , her husband a baptist minister and their six children fled to refugee camps in congo \( then zaire \) two years later , after violence erupted in the camps , the family was forced to separate and endured years of trekking and hiding in the jungle in 2000 , international humanitarian groups designated the two oldest sons as refugees and resettled them in buffalo while working menial jobs , the brothers earned two bachelor s and four master s degrees between them and started families of their own they quickly earned united states citizenship and soon sponsored their mother , who had been widowed in 2000 , for legal permanent residency after she arrived in 2008 , from rwanda , ms nyirahabiyambere found work , with health care benefits , as a laundry attendant in a nursing home when her oldest son moved to virginia for a new job , she accompanied him so she could help care for his children , losing her in the process after the devastating in april , ms nyirahabiyambere never regained awareness her sons held out hope that her condition would improve after seven weeks , hospital officials started trying to discharge ms nyirahabiyambere in some cases where illegal immigrants or new immigrants require longterm care , hospitals have taken to , a practice that advocates for immigrants condemn georgetown university hospital told ms nyirahabiyambere s sons to find a nursing home , take her into their own homes or send her back to rwanda but , the sons said , without private insurance or medicaid to cover a nursing home or home health attendant , none of those options was feasible they said they understood that the hospital was a business and not a charity but simply did not know what to do they stalled , and tensions between the family and the hospital escalated in november , the hospital filed a court petition in alexandria , va , seeking to have a guardian appointed the hospital declined to discuss the case , citing patient confidentiality , but stated , we only take this somewhat unusual step when there is a concern that the family members are legally appropriate decision makers a brief hearing took place dec 28 before judge nolan b dawkins of alexandria circuit court ms nyirahabiyambere s sons requested that she be appointed a separate lawyer she was not , although john m powell , a board member of the , said she should have been , given the complexities of the case the sons pleaded for the family to retain the power to decide their mother s fate but judge dawkins appointed ms sloan , who is a lawyer and nurse , as ms nyirahabiyambere s guardian on the recommendation of a lawyer who had reviewed the case for the court and had been paid by the hospital the judge noted that the sons have not accomplished making arrangements for a medically appropriate discharge ms sloan quickly arranged to transfer ms nyirahabiyambere to a maryland nursing home the hospital agreed to cover the home s costs , although it had not offered to do so when the family was agonizing over how to deal with their mother s situation the nursing home stay was destined to be shortlived ms sloan , who said she is not being paid by georgetown university hospital or by anybody else at this point , placed ms nyirahabiyambere into she said the family , while understandably traumatized , was nonetheless avoiding difficult decisions hospitals cannot afford to allow families the time to work through their grieving process by allowing the relatives to remain hospitalized until the family reaches the acceptance stage , if that ever happens , ms sloan said in an email generically speaking , what gives any one family or person the right to control so many scarce health care resources in a situation where the prognosis is poor , and to the detriment of others who may actually benefit from them \? ms sloan said she could not get the family to participate in meetings she convened the sons told her in phone conversations and emails that they supported do not hospitalize and orders but they said that their mother would not have wanted the feeding tube removed after a life spent struggling to survive war and privation ending someone s life by hunger is morally wrong and unrecognized in the culture of the people of rwanda , one son wrote to ms sloan ms sloan said that she listened to the family but that respect does not mean acquiescence in emails to the sons , she wrote you have asked for understanding about your culture and that is exactly what i am trying to do feeding tubes are not part of your culture , are they \? she said she would disconnect their mother unless they could demonstrate that she wished to live out her life with a feeding tube , in diapers , with no communication with anyone and in a nursing home some guardians said they withdrew life support only if they felt certain about what the patient would have wanted my bias was if there was any doubt i always erred on the side of life , because erring on the other side was irreversible , said robert fleischner , a lawyer at the in massachusetts as of late thursday afternoon , almost two weeks after the feeding tube was removed , ms nyirahabiyambere was still alive
skolkovo , russia as the start of president s news conference drew near on wednesday , 800 journalists were in such a state of anticipation that they burst into spontaneous applause when an aide climbed up to the podium to adjust a teacup set out for the president mr medvedev s televised questionandanswer session his first such event since taking office three years ago had the trappings of a major political announcement , coming at a moment of deep intrigue about whether he will run for president again or step aside to make way for his mentor , prime minister  but in the end mr medvedev chose not to use the gleaming platform for anything beyond hints at his intentions he acknowledged that the news conference would be an appealing and tempting moment for an announcement , and that his audience expected it , but said that for reasons he did not explain , the time was not right the whole election process sets its own rules of the game , and i will follow them too , he said at the event , held at the skolkovo business school outside moscow you can expect an announcement soon he said that the two men saw s future differently , with mr putin advocating a calm , gradual approach to modernization , while he would pursue a swifter pace of reforms one of his most telling responses , to a question about his decision to replace veteran regional leaders , seemed to refer equally to the choice currently before mr putin , whose rule of russia will approach two decades if he returns to the presidency and serves six years no one can stay in power forever , mr medvedev said people who harbor such illusions usually come to a rather bad end , and the world has given us quite a few examples of late this applies to the regional governors , too you cannot have one and the same person in power for 20 years , even if they are competent , well qualified , and know their region , he said we need to open the road to young people commentators began to deconstruct mr medvedev s appearance as soon as it ended many liberals eager to see him seize the political initiative by declaring his candidacy or announcing significant firings said he had let a fateful moment slip by lilia shevtsova , an analyst at the moscow carnegie center , described the appearance as political harakiri , all but guaranteeing that mr putin would return mr medvedev has practically no time left to declare his political intentions , read an editorial on the online newspaper this means that russia s new president will be chosen behind the scenes , and not in public but other analysts found hints that mr medvedev was prepared to fight for power one possibility discussed in recent weeks was that mr medvedev could use his extraordinary executive powers to dismiss part or all of the government , up to and including mr putin asked wednesday why he had not fired ministers since becoming president , mr medvedev said he had complaints about their work but did not think piecemeal firings were effective , suggesting he would consider a broader overhaul in the middle of the news conference , mr medvedev glanced down at his and announced a piece of news sergei m mironov had been removed as head of the federation council , the upper house of russia s parliament mr mironov , a loyal ally of mr putin , helped the kremlin establish a just russia , a progovernment opposition party he had become an increasingly vociferous critic of united russia , the governing party , and the authorities in his native st petersburg minutes earlier , mr medvedev had answered a question about the conflict , calling it a sign of political competition none of us wants to have just one party deciding everything , he said what we are seeing now reflects the differences that exist in political life at the moment
a wayfaring stranger , wandering into tiny nadine , nm , in years past , would not have officially been anywhere , at least in the eyes of the united states census with only a few hundred souls , it was counted , if at all , as an extension of hobbs , the nearest real city of about 34 , 000 people just to the north now , nadine has become , for the first time , a census designated place , along with two other nearby rural areas , north hobbs and monument , under rules that the census introduced in 2000 allowing recognition to places that might have as few as handful of people the rules opened the door to a kind of pointillist geography of place , where the tiniest of places can , if not quite roar , then at least clear their throats and speak around the nation , nearly 10 , 000 other wide spots in the road joined the list too , from ballplay , ala , to pulcifer , wis california had more new places than any other state 1 , 043 but even rhode island managed to find 26 hamlets in 2010 meriting an official name but what happened in nadine and its much larger neighbor , hobbs , also says a lot about ethnic and economic identity in postrecession america and how people on the ground can use the census for their own ends and interests , rather than the government s the region made a concentrated effort to get everyone counted , hoping to make the case that the area was ripe for business investment given the ferocious competition among small communities for chain stores , restaurants and manufacturers , everyone got involved in pushing , said bob reid , a board member at the lea county community improvement corporation encouraging residents to fill out their census forms included a doortodoor campaign and a parade to the post office in hobbs organized by the hobbs hispano chamber of commerce , followed by a cookout the drumbeat for participation worked hobbs s population , in the new count , grew nearly 17 percent , as did the county s as a whole and fingers are crossed a new farm equipment supply store opened in hobbs last month with a better census count , an additional pattern has emerged , as well hispanics in the county surged from just under 40 percent of the total in the 2000 census to 511 percent nadine and its sister microtowns are , as it turns out , majority nonhispanic , the 2010 census said but mr reid at the community improvement corporation said none of that matters a larger , more diverse hobbs area means a larger potential pie for all the president of the hobbs hispano chamber of commerce , oscar gonzalez , agreed we partnered with all the communities , he said , referring to the census participation drive that boosted hobbs and its new satellite towns and they 're close enough in vicinity that we all benefit
a deluge forced the junior tournament to be moved thursday from flushing meadows to indoor courts in port chester , ny to the young players , it was a reminder of how far they have to go in tennis , a sport to which many have dedicated much of their lives only the best juniors 64 boys and 64 girls compete in the junior open and they come from all over the world most are fulltime players , and a fair number have met in other highprofile tournaments their struggle to reach the professional ranks reflects the gladiatorial nature of tennis , its headtohead matchups and its unforgiving rankings at the junior level , the players scramble not for glory or riches , but for training and attention , and in the case of the americans , the limited subsidies dispensed by the player development program of the  a large number of the most promising youngsters , starting at 11 or 12 , are being groomed at the usta s 19 regional centers , all established since 2008 the elite like christina mchale and sloane stephens , who made a splash in the first week of this year s open are recruited for one of the three main centers in boca raton , fla , and carson , calif , and at the billie jean king national tennis center in queens grace min , who trains at boca raton , won the girls tournament at the open on sunday , beating topseeded caroline garcia of france we started working with 16yearold kids three years ago , said martin blackman , who heads talent identification and development for the usta , a program created to help american players catch up with those in other countries for decades , american fans were used to waves of freshfaced stars , many of them teenagers jimmy connors and chris evert in the 1970s in the '80s andre agassi , pete sampras , jim courier , michael chang and jennifer capriati in the '90s andy roddick and the williams sisters in the 2000s most were taught by private coaches but that approach no longer seems to be working , especially now that other nations have developed comprehensive programs without a system , you 're at the mercy of prodigies and private programs , blackman said the expense of developing a worldclass player from age 10 to 20 is astronomical training , traveling , equipment some question the usta s results three years into the program , only four american men and three women are ranked among the world s top 50 , and none are younger than 25 american tennis is in the sorriest state it has ever been , said tim mayotte , a former top10 player mayotte resigned as the head of a program in flushing over what he called very openly spoken reservations about the usta s approach in a recent interview , he criticized antiquated coaching methods that emphasize long hours swatting balls rather than learning technique and movement mayotte also said the usta was too insular , opportunistically luring talented players and putting them under the tutelage of inexperienced staff he favors the approach of the french tennis federation , which identifies and supports independent coaches who do good work the usta will earn an estimated 200 million from the open this year , and a good deal of it will go into player development , as it has since 2008 i ca n't tell you the overall figure , blackman said our regional training centers receive anywhere from 8 , 000 to 100 , 000 a year depending on the program and players i do n't know how that compares to programs overseas for the juniors , firstround play began sept 4 on the outer courts at the national tennis center a handful of spectators were sprinkled in the bleachers , including coaches , parents and other players yet the excitement was palpable a good showing could lead to an invitation to a summer camp or a training session or even result in a wildcard spot in the qualifying tournament for next year s main draw jack sock , 18 , who won last year s junior open and the national junior tournament in july in kalamazoo , mich , earned a wild card to this year s open draw he reached the second round , losing to andy roddick , and won the mixed doubles title with another american teenager , 19yearold melanie oudin another american , bjorn fratangelo , 18 , won the junior in may , the first american to capture the title since john mcenroe in 1977 fratangelo also played in the qualifying tournament for the united states open s main draw but was dismissed in the first round by a brawny journeyman , fritz wolmarans of south africa there was no way he had a chance against that guy , said mario fratangelo , bjorn s father , who named him for his idol bjorn borg he was 63 , big shoulders , just too strong that match , played on the outer courts at the national tennis center , possibly fed fratangelo s doubts about turning professional i 'll take the next year to turn to think it over , he said yet fratangelo receives considerable money and encouragement from the usta with his father as his main coach , he trains intermittently in boca raton i like playing the kids there , said fratangelo , who added that the coaches put me in practices and drills he also does whatever they think i should do running , sprinting , not a lot of weights fratangelo may need to rethink weight training a shade under 6 feet , with a wiry build , he could have trouble holding his own in an increasingly physical game on the men s circuit , players like the 69 john isner and the 67 kevin anderson are no longer exceptions , and jowilfried tsonga , at 62 and 200 pounds , covers the court with catlike grace even the women are taller compared with the 62 maria sharapova , caroline wozniacki , at 510 , seems merely average being tall is one big component , said mark kovacs , a sports scientist in charge of fitness at the boca raton facility also being extremely fast this makes it hard to assess players ages 11 to 14 , kovacs said , when their bodies are still forming clues can be found in a player s lineage the height of parents , grandparents , even uncles and aunts then the monitoring begins monthly height measurements are important , kovacs said seatedheight measurements are important players who enter the usta program are also screened for muscle imbalances and weaknesses that could hamper their progress hightech rackets and strings enable players to hit the ball harder and with more spin while keeping it in play tennis is now all about defense , kovacs said it s about lateral movement and this in turn requires foot speed , along with power in the hips and core the dominant players of the moment are not creative shot makers like mcenroe and roger federer , who end points quickly , but counterpunchers like rafael nadal and novak djokovic , highly athletic versions of the grinders from the past they hit with power from all angles and wear down opponents through superior strength and speed these attributes mattered less when boris becker and chang won grand slam titles at 17 today , success at such an early age is unheard of players peak later , sometimes in their mid20s this means longer , and costlier , apprenticeships and if they top off physically , they can go the way of oudin , a sensation at 17 at the 2009 open who has since attained middling results in singles , or donald young , a prodigy at 15 who lacks the size of many other pros young , now 22 , finally made a strong run at the united states open , reaching the fourth round in perhaps the most exciting firstround junior match , alexios halebian , a 17yearold from glendale , calif , pulled out a threeset victory over fourthseeded thiago moura monteiro of brazil halebian s mother , asmik , and his brother edmund were among the small gathering in the bleachers , quietly applauding we give him all the support we can , asmik halebian said many years , many thousands of dollars more than i can count she is a cake designer , and her husband is a baker the couple emigrated from armenia more than 20 years ago she enrolled her sons in tennis lessons alexios s talent soon emerged the teacher said one day he will be playing here , she said , gesturing toward the court when alexios was 13 , the halebians entrusted him to the usta now 17 , he has been living at the boca raton center for four years , executing oncourt drills , building strength through the fitness regimens devised by kovacs and playing tournaments he also attends school there we see him sometimes , asmik halebian said at thanksgiving and christmas all the time he travels the usta covers his expenses we cover ours , including airfare to the open jay berger , the usta s head men s coach , who watched the third set , assessed halebian s tools good serve , moves well , good intangibles , he said he needs to solidify the rest of his game his ground strokes a college scholarship could someday come , but halebian chose another route the lower rungs of the pro tour it was clear he had developed the demeanor of a pro after defeating monteiro , halebian peeled off his sweaty shirt , autographed tennis balls for a couple of fans and accepted the goodnatured teasing from some starstruck teenage boys
it s a foolish question , asking how smart a politician is it s too vague it ignores all the different wrinkles of intelligence and ways to measure it , along with the debatable link between brain power as it s typically defined and skilled governance in terms of actual results it s a vessel for prejudices , a standin for grievances and yet it comes back around almost every election cycle , as it s doing now meet rick perry at texas am university , his grades were so poor he was on academic probation he flunked advanced organic chemistry , which , in his defense , sounds eminently flunkable he got a c in animal breeding , which does n't for a principles of economics course , he attained a glittering d , as the huffington post you wo n't be hearing him mention that much amid all his talk about texas jobs creation his academic background , coupled with his rejection of climate change and fondness for gauzy generalities , prompted a last week with this subtle headline is rick perry dumb \? based on grades alone , it seems so but by that yardstick , even a politician as outwardly cerebral as al gore has some explaining to do gore got his very college d in a course about man s place in nature , no less granted , this was at harvard but still perry ca n't dazzle in policy discussions that s also clear the farther he ventures from texas , the smaller he shrinks when the radio talk show host laura ingraham recently to get him to say something specific specific about how america should deal with china , he clung so tightly to banalities that she was forced twice to what does that mean \? but he s savvy enough to have assembled a political team and adopted a political strategy that have him leading the \( flawed \) republican field in a raft of recent polls there s something to that something more than excellent hair i'm less troubled by how thickheaded perry may be than by how wrongheaded we already know he is on issues like evolution , which he says is just a , and homosexuality , which he has likened to  president obama has those issues right and can talk authoritatively about them and most others a former editor of the harvard law review , he has that kind of mind , that kind of fluency in this one poised man , erudition and eloquence join hands but they do n't save him last week , he set himself up once again to look like the nation s deferrer in chief by proposing a for his jobs speech that had the possibility of provoking republican opposition and did precisely that , at which point he retreated is this the mothermayi presidency \? with john boehner in the role of paddlewielding matriarch \? that many republicans will viciously seize any opportunity to defy and undercut obama is a lesson he should have learned by now regardless of who was being unreasonable , it was he who actually ended up sending an to supporters with the oneword subject line frustrated the president of the united states is supposed to salve frustrations , not meekly bemoan his own should n't he or someone in his inner circle have foreseen the potential for events unfolding in such a humiliating fashion and made sure to avoid it \? apparently no one did , and that suggests a deficit of smarts by almost any definition of that ludicrously imprecise term worse yet , this was only the latest in a long series of questionable calculations was it smart prudent pickyouradjective to lavish all that precious postelection political capital on health care reform rather than economic revitalization and jobs creation , especially if it winds up being the first in a chain of dominoes that leads to defeat in 2012 and the repeal of that precise legislation \? was it smart prudent pickyouradjective not to head off a debtceiling showdown by settling the matter during last year s lameduck session of congress , before republicans took the reins in the house \? and , during the showdown , did n't obama and his advisers misjudge both the zeal of some house republicans and the magnitude of his own powers of persuasion \? time and again , obama has n't been a prescient or brutal enough tactician and has n't adjusted his highminded ways to the lowminded sport of congressional politics that s a failure of some kind , and intelligence may be one word for it is obama smart \? the wall street journal columnist bret stephens in early august that was the headline , and it s at least as good a question , in terms of the president s political efficacy of late , as the one politico posed about perry that perry s headline contained the harsher adjective dumb is typical , say many republicans , who complain that journalists tend to equate the antiintellectualism and populist affects of many of their party s candidates with outright stupidity they cite ronald reagan as an example of someone first dismissed as a dunce and understood only later to be wise in some basic , consequential ways and they say that democrats get a greater pass on gaffes than republicans do there s merit to the argument the recent verbal hiccup with which joe biden seemed to china s onechild policy lengthened a formidable list of bidenisms , including his in 2007 that obama , as a presidential contender , was the first mainstream africanamerican who is articulate and bright and clean but biden s intelligence is seldom questioned , not the way it would be if he had a tea party affiliation and southern drawl then there s the whole matter of whether we 're well served by a brainy president in an excellent in slate in 1999 , jacob weisberg explored a growing body of thought that a president s supposed brilliance \( or lack thereof \) has no bearing on success in office by this theory , relatively ordinary smarts yielded extraordinary accomplishment \( reagan , franklin d roosevelt , harry s truman \) while extreme intelligence led to defeat \( jimmy carter , richard nixon , herbert hoover \) weisberg rightly noted the huge flaws with this analysis , including the small sample size and the subjectivity involved in judging achievement here s another what makes carter more brilliant than roosevelt or , for that matter , reagan \? that assessment reflects a narrow , traditional understanding of smarts as a sort of academic aptitude , a facility with facts and language but a whole genre of bestselling books over the last decade and a half insist correctly , i think that there are various ways to be clever , , a knack for gut responses formed in the span of a none require exemplary sat scores instead of talking about how smart politicians are or are n't , we should have an infinitely more useful , meaningful conversation about whether we share and respect their values and whether they have shown themselves to be effective someone who rates high on both counts is someone to rally unreservedly around right now , neither perry nor obama fits that double bill
greenburgh , ny seven players , none of them named tyson chandler , worked out friday as the officially opened training camp but chandler , a 7foot1 center , could arrive as soon as saturday , once all the dominoes fall that have to precede his official acquisition using the amnesty clause to release chauncey billups and trading ronny turiaf both moves need to occur to create the salarycap space the knicks need to sign chandler , who played for dallas last season his imminent arrival , though , was the talk of day 1 , the latest first day of the latest new era for a team that seems to produce one annually , sometimes even during the season the good thing about it is , now , we 're shaking things up , but it s getting better , coach mike d'antoni said as he began the final season of his original fouryear contract i can handle that it s shaking things up and getting worse that was n't good now , this is exciting of course , the moves could leave toney douglas , whom the organization considers more of a combination guard than a point guard , as the starting point guard , at least temporarily but the knicks could acquire a guard released by another team under the amnesty provision of the league s new labor deal baron davis could be on his way out of cleveland the knicks are unlikely to claim gilbert arenas , who was let go by orlando on friday mike bibby has emerged as one option to replace billups the 33yearold bibby is in discussions with two or three other teams as well , and the knicks are not yet ready to commit to him chandler would bring the knicks their strongest inside presence since patrick ewing guarded the lane chandler also would allow amar'e stoudemire to spend most of his time at power forward , his natural position , instead of getting beaten up by banging with opposing centers playing out of position contributed to stoudemire s back problems during the knicks' brief playoff appearance last season we definitely were focusing on becoming a better defensive team , stoudemire said we were looking for a center , and tyson chandler is a perfect fit for us , the knicks' big inseason acquisition last season , said we got what everybody wanted and hoped to get , which is a big man tyson , he s established himself as a dominant force on the defensive end chandler will receive a fouryear deal expected to be worth as much as 58 million he could also land with the knicks via a signandtrade deal for a lowersalaried player like renaldo balkman , or possibly turiaf that would give dallas a significant trade exception it could use in another deal adding chandler prevents the knicks from using the highend \( approximately 5 million per year \) salarycap exception slot they would probably need to sign a point guard like the dallas free agent j j barea it just did n't make business sense , chandler said friday in a dallas radio interview about staying with the he also said of the knicks , being able to play alongside amar'e stoudemire , carmelo anthony and the young talent that we have , i feel like it puts us in contention over the next four or five years jason kidd , the veteran point guard who teamed with chandler last season in the mavericks' run to the championship , said it s a great pickup leadershipwise , coming off a championship year , those guys can pick his brain on what it takes d'antoni said that chandler brings everything that we did n't have it will shore up our defense , our rebounding , he added he s a great teammate his intangibles are off the chart but adding chandler also would wipe out the salarycap room the knicks might have used in next summer s freeagent market to me that sounds like a good idea , d'antoni said you 're getting a great player that is a need that we really need there 'd be no reason to bypass this to chase a dream this is a dream chandler , 29 , also fills out a strong frontcourt with anthony and stoudemire , at least on paper , anthony said on paper , point guard is now a huge question mark i told toney today , there s a lot of pressure on you , son , ' anthony said d'antoni said to alleviate that pressure , pending the addition of a point guard , the ball will now go through other players' hands , particularly anthony s in the pickandroll sets that are the foundation of d'antoni s offense i think the team will look more like an old celtics team , d'antoni said , citing the way the ball often went to larry bird before finding its way to danny ainge and dennis johnson in the backcourt now , melo will be doing the pickandrolls more , d'antoni said , using anthony s nickname and that s a good thing melo s one of the best passers we have and he 'll be involved a lot more running the team once chandler is on board , the knicks can begin filling out their roster by resigning jared jeffries , then signing their firstround pick , iman shumpert , and josh harrellson , a secondround draft pick they acquired in a trade

the lead story on thursday remains the death of the jockey michael baze  daily racing form reports that autopsy on the rider did not reveal an anatomical cause of death , and a toxicology report for baze will not be available for about three weeks his former agent ron ebanks says in the pasadena starnews , i think he went through a separation with his wife and i think that depressed him sadness and depression are the worst things in the world for anyone and i think that got a hold of him the new york post notes that baze was scheduled for a preliminary hearing today on a cocaine charge dating to last nov 18 , when he was arrested by louisville , ky , police in a downtown parking lot during a drug stakeout according to the arrest warrant , a detective found a small baggie of suspected cocaine in baze s pants pocket the post quotes the retired rider richard migliore on baze he was a nice kid i knew he was struggling with some stuff he seemed to get easily depressed and was so up and down he would lose a photo finish and hang his head , then he would win a race and be out of control i told him , if you re going to be around for a while , don t get too high or too low what a shame what a waste of talent joe drape in the new york times adds that baze failed a breathalyzer test at oaklawn park before the races on march 11 and was taken off his mounts and fined 500 it was notable because the test was administered at the request of other riders or officials who suspected he might have been intoxicated when he arrived to ride drape quotes jerry bailey on the problems that young riders have with substance abuse bailey says , you re separated from your family and making more money than you ve ever seen , and the wrong role models latch on to you , and you don t have the social skill to recognize it it happened to me , and you throw in addiction , like i had , and i may have been 24 , but my mind was of a 16yearold i found success after i quit drinking , and i am fortunate the louisville courierjournal quotes the jockey gary stevens who was related to baze by a prior marriage stevens says no one had a clue none of us knew the whole family is so shocked if i d known , i d have said , c mon , let s go take care of these issues , kid stevens also says that baze was the best rider i ve seen finishing on horses since cordero retired ray paulick adds , but as long as horse racing allows 16yearolds to become professional jockeys making large sums of money , and the industry fails to require or even provide personal training , education , or orientation programs for them , we are going to be churning out more young people with addiction and behavior problems in the jockeys room and if you think these are isolated incidents , think again triple crown news was basically light with most of the reports centering on the activities of the kentucky derby winner animal kingdom and his connections animal kingdom has returned from kentucky and is back in maryland and has settled into his stall at fair hill , which is an idyllic horse heaven according to steve haskin in the bloodhorse alex brown for the new york times writes , the bright chestnut colt looked fantastic animal kingdom jogged one mile at the training track and was super really good , according to the trainer graham motion motion is not likely to bring animal kingdom to pimlico until may 20 , the day before the preakness garry west at the fort worth startelegram is not a fan of barry irwin , the chief executive of team valor west writes in effect , he told a national audience that plenty of trainers are contemptible liars who can t be trusted and , of course , if trainers can t be trusted , then how can the sport expect the trust of its fans and bettors \? the wilmington news journal looks at the full field lining up for the preakness and says it s the ultimate sign of disrespect for the kentucky derby winner when the other horses in the race are lining up to run in the preakness the thoroughbred times finds that the preakness has been terrific at producing eclipse award winners in the past 12 years , the preakness has been a procession of champions with ten straight winners who have gone on to eclipse awards , including the allconquering filly rachel alexandra in 2009 since 1997 , the only nonchampion preakness winner was red bullet in 2000 the jilted jockey robby albarado will be on board king congie in the preakness terry finley , the president of west point stable , which owns king congie , believes , as the daily news reports , that albarado will be at his best , trying to thwart animal kingdom s attempt to sweep the triple crown the news also reports that albarado was paid between team valor and john velazquez the full share that a jockey would have received for winning the derby nonetheless , neither party admitted to how much they gave barry irwin says , in usa today , i can t tell you how much that it is but john was extra generous with robby robby will have a very nice payday tim layden reviews the running of the kentucky derby for sports illustrated and simply seems unsure of the merits of animal kingdom he writes what to make of the derby winner \?

heading into the stretch run of baseball s regular season , the atlanta braves are playing like their playoff teams of the 1990s , with the national league s secondbest record and the postseason in sight nowhere to be found , though , are legends like greg maddux , tom glavine , john smoltz , andruw jones and javy lopez the only leftover from the braves playoff run from 1991 to 2005 is chipper jones , the shouldbe hall of fame third baseman the braves are succeeding with largely the same recipe that served them so well under manager bobby cox and general manager john schuerholz developing good young pitching to go with an offense built around a smaller set of strong offensive players through wednesday , the braves starters had the fourthlowest earned run average in the league at 359 and were led by 25yearold jair jurrjens \( 263 era \) , 35yearold tim hudson \( 331 era \) and 24yearolds tommy hanson \( 320 era \) and brandon beachy \( 349 era \) and there are more on the way four starters in the braves farm system all ranked among baseball america s top 100 prospects before the season julio teheran \( no 5 \) , randall delgado \( no 35 \) , mike minor \( no 37 \) and arodys vizcaino \( no 93 \) are all 23 or younger and are all on the class aaa gwinnett braves , providing atlanta with one of the deepest pools of starting pitching talent of recent memory as good as the starters have been , the relievers have been better braves relievers have an era of 283 , just behind the padres 279 era , which is aided by pitcherfriendly petco park the leader of the bullpen is craig kimbrel , a 23yearold flamethrower , who has saved 32 games and struck out 86 batters in 54 innings kimbrel s 143 strikeouts per nine innings pitched is the eighth highest ever by a reliever with 50 or more innings pitched leading up to kimbrel are the 26yearold lefthanded workhorses jonny venters \( 126 era in 64 innings pitched \) and eric o flaherty \( 089 era in 50 innings pitched \) it s a good thing for the braves that their pitching has been so strong , because in sabermetric terms their position players are slightly below average across the board as hitters , they are 39 runs below league average as base runners , they are eight runs below average and as fielders they are two runs below average most of the offensive value is produced by a small core catcher brian mccann is the team leader in batting average , onbase percentage and slugging percentage , but is on the disabled list with an oblique strain picking up the slack in his absence is freddie freeman , a 21yearold rookie first baseman who is hitting 332 388 549 in his last 60 games and may be challenged only by kimbrel in voting for rookie of the year aside from mccann and freeman , none of the braves position players are producing at a high level , and this is perhaps the most curious of development for the braves few would have expected that jason heyward , last year s rookie of the year runnerup , would struggle through his sophomore season , batting 223 , and that second baseman dan uggla , the braves major offseason pickup , would need a recent hot streak raise his batting average to 215 seeing the need to improve the offense , the braves acquired michael bourn , an outstanding base runner and top defender in center field , from the houston astros at the trade deadline things had become so dire in center field that jose costanza , a 27yearold minor league journeyman with six career minor league home runs , started the three games before bourn arrived despite splitting with the phillies through 12 matchups this season , the braves were still eight games behind philadelphia through wednesday , a deficit they are unlikely to make up the braves lead the diamondbacks in the wild card race , and with the addition of bourn and a reasonably quick return of mccann from the disabled list , they are a strong favorite to reach the postseason braves fans might even dare to dream a little with their top four starters and leftyheavy bullpen , they will make for a dangerous playoff opponent even for the phillies juggernaut sean forman is the creator of baseballreferencecom , an online baseball encyclopedia of players , teams and box scores in the major and minor leagues
beirut , lebanon until about two years ago , few in yemen or the arab world had heard of , the americanborn propagandist for islamic radicalism whose president obama celebrated as a major blow against  a dimeadozen cleric was one response , by gregory johnsen , a princeton professor who studies yemen another i do n't think your average middle easterner knows who anwar alawlaki is , said emad shahin , a scholar of political islam at notre dame university while western officials and commentators saw the end of mr awlaki as another serious loss for al qaeda , a very different reception in the middle east was the latest reminder of the disconnect between american aims and arab perceptions in a region transfixed by the drama of its revolts , mr awlaki s voice has had almost no resonance i do n't think this will really get people s interest , i ca n't imagine why it would , said shadi hamid , director of research at the brookings doha center it seems totally irrelevant to how arabs view the world right now they do n't care about awlaki it is a remarkable feature in the arab world these days how little al qaeda actually comes up in conversations even before the eruption of revolts and revolutions , a group that bore some responsibility for two wars and deepening american involvement from north africa to iraq was losing its significance when osama bin laden died , his killing seemed more an epitaph for another era as is often remarked , the events of sept 11 seem a historical note to much of an arab population where three in five are younger than 30 in that atmosphere , many saw mr awlaki s death as an essentially american story here was a man that american attention helped create , and its hellfire missiles killed , in a campaign born out of american fears of homegrown militancy what distinguished mr awlaki was not his ideas or influence but his american upbringing , passport and perfectly idiomatic english when the obama administration and the us media started focusing on him , that is when al qaeda in the arabian peninsula pushed him to the fore , mr johnsen said , referring to the group s yemeni branch they were taking advantage of the free publicity , if you will and any stature he has now in the arab world is because of that another analyst , michael wahid hanna , a fellow at the century foundation , echoed the idea that mr awlaki s fluency in english generated more interest about him the us focus on awlaki was a function of his language abilities and their understanding of his role as a recruiter and propagandist if recent events can be said to further marginalize violent rejectionists such as bin laden and ayman alzawahri , then there is very little room for a virtual unknown such as awlaki to command any serious attention mr hanna said that was even more the case with the arab world having plunged into what he described as this transformational juncture given the enormity of political turmoil that has toppled or threatened leaders across the region , many in the arab world appeared to see mr awlaki s death not as a turn in the battle between the united states and al qaeda but rather as a twist in the dramas of popular uprisings in yemen and five other states commentators evaluated his killing mainly as a potential factor in the obama administration s relations with yemen , where pressure on president ali abdullah saleh to step down has intensified the white house this will not change our call for the departure of the yemeni president , was the headline in the saudiowned newspaper asharq alawsat some feared mr saleh would use the killing to try to convince the united states that he remained an essential ally in the battle against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula others hoped that the american perception of a defeat for al qaeda might encourage the obama administration to turn its back on mr saleh for yemenis , they are much more likely to see this in terms of the domestic drama , said sheila carapico , an expert on yemen and professor at the university of richmond al qaeda does have some role to play but the standard narrative in yemen is that ali abdullah saleh cultivated al qaeda for a long time analysts are debating how much of an operational role mr awlaki might have played in the group one view is that mr awlaki was more important as a source of inspiration than as a vital facilitator for attacks mr awlaki s words appear to have touched a chord with a series of independent freelancers like the who opened fire at fort hood in 2009 , or the in times square those cases helped stoke national anxieties about a new wave of homegrown militants , evidence of which still seems incidental whether the interest in his words was a cause or a symptom of their motivation to violence is , of course , impossible to answer , like the related question of whether they would have acted without him but he is not unique in his role as the american voice of al qaeda recruiting united states counterterrorism officials say there are as many as 100 englishlanguage sites offering militant islamic views , a saudiborn american who moved to yemen two years ago and was killed along with mr awlaki , produced inspire magazine , a qaeda publication aimed at englishspeaking muslims its issue celebrating the 10th anniversary of the sept 11 attacks included an interview with adam yahiye gadahn , an american convert and qaeda supporter also based in yemen mr johnsen argued that al qaeda would continue to try to court potential lone wolves inside the united states as mr awlaki did because they cost little in training or organization , for a big potential payoff in attacks but others in the middle east suggested a turn toward audiences in europe and the united states seemed symptomatic of their flagging audience here assassinations of top leaders have done little to diminish the pull of militant organizations like hamas in the palestinian territories and hezbollah in lebanon with mass constituencies , extensive charitable outreach and pervasive grassroots networks but then al qaeda shares almost none of those attributes so amorphous , it sometimes seems more a state of mind it does n't really matter who leads hamas , said mr hamid , at brookings the organization is much stronger than the sum of its individuals it probably does have more of an impact with a group like al qaeda , which is losing support , hemorrhaging support it needs all the leaders it can get it needs all the members it can get to stay viable
washington like any selfrespecting irish catholic boy from boston , i covered the walls of my childhood bedroom with red sox paraphernalia , images of jesus and photos of the kennedy brothers yes jack , bobby and teddy unnaturally handsome for politicians , they had a look in their eyes that said , let s save the world from nuclear annihilation right after this game of touch football from a young age i decided that if the red sox would n't take me , surely the kennedys would that s why , when i moved to washington five years ago to attend graduate school at georgetown , i resolved to get a job with senator edward kennedy i hoped to become an assistant at least , or an adviser or perhaps even dare to dream a speechwriter instead , i became splash , the senator s portuguese water dog having begged my way into an internship with the senator , i spent most of my time making copies , keeping records and answering phones but then on a quiet winter afternoon when there was not much else going on , my supervisor came to me with an apologetic look on her face the senator , she explained , had recently written a children s book called my senator and me the book depicts a day in his life from splash s perspective someone i'm not sure who suggested including an email address where curious young readers could reach the supposedly computersavvy splash that s where i came in someone had to reply to splash s emails , in his voice , lest the children think the dog had let the thrill of being a published author and washington power broker go to his head i 'd taken splash on walks on more than one occasion once , near the russell senate office building , we happened upon a mysterious pile of pellets that appeared to be some kind of fertilizer splash lurched toward them and devoured a mouthful before i could stop him as i ferociously tugged on his leash , a headline ran through my head intern returns poisoned dog to living legend but beyond splash s indiscriminate eating habits and love of tennis balls , he was little more than a furry mystery to me what would he say in response to the hundreds of emails that came to him from children across the country \? school simply had n't prepared me for this most of his messages went something like this after checking with the senator s assistants on splash s preferred dog food brand , and then reading the book myself to better prepare for my role , i answered every single email , ending each reply with the mandatory woof woof ! ! splash my feelings on this assignment were conflicted , to say the least on the one hand , i was impersonating a dog on the other , i was heartened by the warmth that people from so many other states felt for the senator from mine in time i found a strange satisfaction in writing back to these puppycrazed children , one that i never got from answering the office phones none of splash s correspondents cared about or even knew senator kennedy s position on the estate tax , or whether he 'd invoke cloture on a resolution to incrementally finance the defense budget in fact , a simple woof ! seemed to be all the constituent outreach they needed to be assured that the senator was on their side of course senator kennedy demonstrated his loyalty to the youth of america in many ways he pushed to finance pell grants for college scholarships and to ensure all children were covered by health insurance , and fought to lower the voting age to 18 today would have been senator kennedy s 79th birthday in december , , a little more than a year after his master reading that sad news , i remembered the liberal lion sitting at his desk while splash slobbered away on a grimy tennis ball in the corner it was an image that had soothed nervous interns and disarmed even kennedy s fiercest critics in congress then i remembered the letters to splash , and i realized those children felt the same way that i had as a kid in boston , and still do that we were all a small part of the kennedy family
for more than eight years before tuesday , was active for every game he collected 1 , 603 hits between trips to the disabled list , and the yankees can only hope this one turns out as well for them as the last that was in 2003 , when jeter dislocated his shoulder in a collision at third base on opening night in toronto the yankees won 25 of 36 games without jeter , whose replacement at shortstop , erick almonte , hit 272 while he was gone the yankees would take the same from eduardo nunez now , with a strained right calf sidelining jeter nunez had a fine start tuesday , driving in the first run in a 124 of the at yankee stadium he said jeter told him to look for a fastball from alexi ogando , and that is what he hit it s a very important player we lost i understand that , nunez said my goal is to play and do my best nunez singled twice in four atbats , and brett gardner , who took over as the leadoff hitter , reached base four times and scored three runs the yankees thrashed the previously unbeaten ogando and belted three home runs off the rangers' bullpen , gaining ground in the american league east standings they stand a game and a half behind the boston red sox , who lost at tampa bay if nunez imitates almonte neither hurting the team nor helping substantially he will easily slide back to the bench when jeter returns but if nunez outperforms jeter , who is hitting a soft 260 , jeter s return could be awkward he is not in his prime , as he was in 2003 nunez said he did not want an opportunity because of injury , but now that he has it , i can show everybody i can play , and i can play every day manager joe girardi said nunez , who is hitting 233 , seemed to play under control do n't try to be derek jeter try to be eduardo nunez , girardi said , explaining his expectations you 're an exciting young player who has a lot of speed and can do some things just stay within yourself ogando came into the game with a 70 record and a 210 earned run average , trailing only boston s josh beckett in the al he was tied with beckett for the lowest opponents' average , at 188 , but the yankees jumped on his high fastballs this was their second time handling ogando , who allowed five runs in the bronx in april in two starts against the yankees , ogando s era is 1238 in 11 starts against all other teams , it is 168 ogando started with a 123 first inning , but the yankees hammered him in the second two hits and a walk brought up nunez with the bases loaded and one out , and he hammered a 11 pitch into left field for a runscoring single gardner singled to left on a check swing with two outs mark teixeira called it a fiverun hit because of the deluge that followed curtis granderson singled in two , teixeira drove in two more to chase ogando , and the yankees were not done nick swisher homered to the first row in left field in the third inning alex rodriguez doubled home two in the fourth granderson smashed a tworun homer to right in the sixth , and three batters later , robinson cano connected for a solo shot granderson matched toronto s jose bautista for the major league lead in home runs , with 21 the yankees lead the majors in homers with 98 an overwhelming advantage on their opponents , who have hit just 51 , including none in seven innings off \( 84 \) on tuesday inside pitch the yankees reached a contract agreement with brian gordon , a 32yearold righthander who was 50 with a 114 earned run average in 12 games \( 9 starts \) for philadelphia s class aaa team gordon , a former outfielder , had an out clause in his contract and asked for his release gordon last pitched on saturday , so the yankees could start him thursday in place of the injured bartolo colon gordon pitched three games for the texas rangers in 2008 the righthander phil hughes threw 49 pitches against yankees minor leaguers tuesday in tampa , fla hughes , who is trying to build arm strength after a sluggish start to his season , is essentially repeating spring training and has worked two simulated games
monday s in new hampshire full of historical error , economic obfuscation , avoidance of hard truths and even outright bigotry was a feast for connoisseurs of political dysfunction desperate to avoid being outflanked on the right , the seven candidates tried so hard to outdo each other in finding fault with president obama that they seemed to forget that they are competing for the same party nomination by evening s end , they had melted into an indistinguishable mass of privatizing , taxcutting opponents of shariah law for the moment , the candidates are appealing to a republican party whose core is so contorted in fury at mr obama that it barely resembles the one that nominated george w bush in 2000 mr bush may have prosecuted the war on terror to excess , but he always reminded the country that it was not at war with islam this batch of republicans has dispensed with such niceties repeated his earlier statement that he would not be comfortable with a muslim in his cabinet some , he explained , are trying to kill us none of the other candidates took him to task for this , a mormon who has himself been the subject of religious slurs , at least mentioned the nation s founding principle of religious tolerance and respect but missed an opportunity to include muslims tumbled over the historical cliff with the idea , announcing some kind of loyalty oath to serve in his administration , similar to that used in dealing with nazis and communists at least no one brandished a list of known muslims serving in mr obama s state department eventually , the winner of the republican nomination will move away from the s anger to try to appeal to a broader electorate that has higher priorities than interfering with laws on and upending congress s decision to welcome openly gay and lesbian soldiers that broader electorate , eager to hear the candidates' plans to resuscitate the economy , would be hard pressed to find a coherent pathway out of joblessness from the republican field on monday night asked how he would start to put the 14 million jobless back to work , said he would repeal and drill for oil was one of several making the tiredandempty argument that more tax cutting would get the economy moving mr santorum actually vowed to let the wealth really trickle down had the strangest , most simplistic economic solution of all simply close down the environmental protection agency , which she said should really be renamed the jobkilling organization of america mr romney , the presumed frontrunner , provided almost no details of his economic plan , except to attack mr obama for making the worse and longer \( he did n't mention that the recession ended in june 2009 \) he said the government s bailout of general motors and chrysler was a waste of money and accused the administration of catering to the auto unions he did not mention that it saved at least 14 million jobs and a vital american industry , which has already paid back half the cost the field was silent on so many things how to cover those without health insurance , how to improve education while slashing budgets , which popular programs to cut after the onslaught of tax reductions it is much easier , apparently , to impress republican voters with the facile argument that president obama has failed but , at some point , those voters are going to want these candidates to start making some distinctions among themselves , and that will require far more truthtelling than was evident on monday

that s the topic of my column for sunday \( frankly , it s hard to write about rapidly changing events , like libya , in my sunday column because the deadline is friday evening and then i can t make changes on saturday even if there is stunning news but the middle east is likely to remain backward on sunday \) there have been lots of theories for why the middle east has lagged in the last 800 years , after earlier serving as a center of trade and scholarship many westerners think the basic problem is islam s inherent incompatibility with capitalism and many arabs and other muslims think the basic problem is western colonialism and exploitation i argue , based on a fascinating new book and the research it discusses , that the best answer is none of the above and i hope the upheavals in the middle east will be able to move beyond this paralyzing debate instead of just talking about why development hasn t happened , let s see if we can make it happen i think there s a bit of a parallel with china for centuries , china stagnated it s per capita income was actually lower at the time of the communist revolution in 1949 than it had been at the end of the song dynasty in 1290 many westerners and chinese alike blamed confucianism in part for china s problems , and there were indeed some reasons why this was a plausible judgment but then since 1978 china boomed , and now it s common to hear that a confucian heritage is one reason east asia has done so well economically again , there are confucian elements \( such as an emphasis on education \) why that is a plausible judgment and with turkey and indonesia doing so well economically , it seems to me hard to argue that islam is an inherent obstacle to capitalist success and modernization read the column and post your comments on it here why do you think the middle east lags , and can that change soon \?
gavin degraw , the hooksavvy singer and songwriter , was recovering from a broken nose at bellevue hospital center on tuesday which he said he suffered when a group of men assaulted him on the lower east side , his publicist said mr degraw , 34 , was taken to bellevue hospital at 4 15 am monday , where he told the police as many as three men had attacked him shortly after he left the national underground , a bar at 159 east houston street , a law enforcement official said the publicist , fran curtis , said the singer not only had a broken nose , but had suffered a concussion , as well as cuts and bruises no one had been arrested in the assault and the motive remained unclear , the police said none of his belongings were taken mr degraw told investigators the men had attacked him after he left the club , which he owns with his brother , joey degraw , who is also a musician he told the police he had spent the night drinking with friends , the official said mr degraw did not call the police immediately after the attack , the official said instead he walked across the east village , heading up first avenue to 19th street , where a southbound taxi knocked him over as he stood in the middle of the avenue , his shirt ripped and his face bloodied although he did not sustain serious injuries from his encounter with the taxi , a passerby saw the accident and called an ambulance and the medics took him to the hospital investigators do not know precisely where the attack occurred , and they were seeking a second interview with mr degraw to get a clearer account , the official said detectives have tried to reconstruct mr degraw s movements with footage from surveillance cameras , the official said one video captured mr degraw at 3 26 am on monday as he walked alone from the bar near allen and houston streets he wore a ripped shirt but did not appear to be bleeding at 3 48 am a second camera filmed him as he walked on first avenue , between third and fourth streets then at 4 01 am he appeared to be bloodied and injured when a camera filmed him walking on the west side of first avenue , near seventh street mr degraw became a poprock star in 2003 , when his debut album chariot \( j records \) yielded several hit singles , among them i don t want to be , which reached the no 1 on the billboard mainstream top 40 chart and later became the theme song for the television show one tree hill his new album , sweeter , is due out on sept 20 still hospitalized on tuesday afternoon , mr degraw canceled a concert at the performing arts center in saratoga springs , ny , but he had not yet called off a performance at jones beach on friday
indianapolis when the deserving athletes from and battled fiercely to the finish for a championship on national television tuesday night , the two words indelibly carved into the sporting psyches of these proud universities hut and hut were nowhere to be heard they last played a football game in 2001 , with am winning , 243 , but neither school has had much bowl championship series success to bluster about \( both did have winning seasons in 2010 \) since then the good news is that the administrative lords in south bend , ind and college station , tex apparently determined that all is not lost when you fall behind the southeastern conference powersthatbe in the sport that simulates war the newage credo if you ca n't beat 'em , then beat 'em at something else the senior center danielle adams scored 30 points , tyra white made her second gamewinning shot in the final four and the aggies outlasted the irish , 7670 , at conseco fieldhouse but before am claimed its first women s national basketball title , it was n't contextually snide to wonder if the game would outweigh the positional updates that captivate the gridiron crowd on campus every spring such is the religiosity of football that gary blair , the aggies' veteran coach , said , perhaps not , given how much of a 365day obsession football is on line the hits that go on in spring football and recruiting versus a men s basketball story or equestrian or women s basketball , it s mindboggling depending on one s point of view or agenda , football is the 999pound gorilla that consumes too much or sustains everything else here is muffet mcgraw , the notre dame coach , on how big brother has impacted her distinguished program that wore this crown in 2001 we love that notre dame is a huge football school and especially now when we 're on the upswing it s even more exciting , she said recruiting takes place mostly on a football weekend we 're in the first row behind the end zone when the team comes in , the first ones that they see i think if you do n't like football , you 're probably not going to come to notre dame is that really the case , or can another one be made that football however much revenue it generates is the doddering old patriarch of an irish sports family that gets better results from other athletes who generally cast the university in a more positive light on the women s side alone , mcgraw s team was trying to join its soccer and fencing counterparts as holders of a national title given the consistent high rankings of its men s and women s jumpshooters , who says notre dame is n't already more of a basketball school \? you know what , it almost is this year , right \? said the irish s point guard , skylar diggins , whose 23 points fell just short the men had a great year at one point , we were like are they ranked higher than us \? oh , no , we ca n't have that' diggins grew up in south bend , played in three high school state finals at conseco and agreed with mcgraw that notre dame s football fixation justified or at this point delusional is helpful but that s not why she went there i knew that notre dame was a place that studentathletes could excel athletically and academically , she said also being from south bend , i understood how big hoosier basketball was sure enough , one night after butler s unsightly demise , conseco was nearly filled by the greenclad chapter of hoosier nation the raucous road conditions made am s secondhalf rally all the more impressive blair did n't have the luxury of tradition or passion when he inherited a sorry aggies program in 2003 and implemented a defensive style that might almost be described as smash mouth he did have a university president , robert gates , who empowered the athletic director , bill byrne , to invest in athletic programs across the board and the gender divide in an interview , byrne reported that in addition to the exponential success of blair s program , the aggies' women s outdoor track and field and equestrian teams are ranked no 1 in the nation he credited gates , who is now the united states secretary of defense our philosophy became , no matter what aggies team took the field , we want them to have the best opportunity to be champions , byrne said the greater wisdom of our sportscrazed culture is another discussion entirely for the purpose of this one , let s just say if notre dame and texas am could commit to excellence in women s sports when their precious football teams were more rudy than rockne , that would seem to be a better gender equity metric than how much the ratings stood to sag without connecticut and stanford in the final as blair likes to say , this title game was played below the rim and between the ears and it was indisputably superior to the men s final showing the aggies shot 547 percent for the game , or triple what butler did monday , making an outrageous 15 of 22 in the second half none of this means the women will storm the college station town square to demand fullblown athletics democracy but sydney carter , the aggies' feisty , 5foot6 guard , said she was flattered by the growing attendance this season even some football players most notably the linebacker and likely top nfl draft pick , von miller became women s basketball fans regarding miller , carter conceded , he s been dating my sister pretty steadily by their own admission , the aggies' style is n't pretty , but they took the attention and the title any way they could get it
the nation s political reporters are making the trek from washington to atlanta on thursday in the belief bolstered by some fresh evidence that the 2012 presidential campaign is about to get fully engaged newt gingrich , the former house speaker , is set to confirm his intention to explore a presidential campaign the first step toward becoming an official candidate for the republican nomination at the same time , matt strawn , the chairman of the iowa republican party , will be in washington thursday to discuss the carefully constructed republican primary and caucus calendar , which is once again threatened by states eager to leapfrog into the early months of the contest and the fox news network has finally begun to confront the obvious dilemma posed by the presence of likely presidential candidates on its payroll on wednesday , the network suspended mr gingrich and rick santorum , a former senator from pennsylvania , as contributors until they decide whether to run for president together , the developments suggest that the race to challenge president obama is about to escape the behindthescenes jockeying phase and enter fullblown campaign season just what mr gingrich plans to say today is in some doubt top aides had signaled this week that he would officially form an exploratory committee but later , aides insisted that his trip to georgia was not designed as a campaign event , though he certainly might answer a question about his plans the associated press reported thursday morning that mr gingrich would begin raising money to gauge his support in advance of formally setting up a committee either way , an official acknowledgment by mr gingrich that he is running for president could jumpstart a race that has been simmering below the surface for months close to half a dozen candidates have said they are considering running for president , but none have so far taken official steps they may not be able to wait much longer with mr gingrich on the move , other serious contenders may feel pressure to make their intentions known and with the first presidential debate scheduled for may 2 , time is running out so , apparently , is the patience of fox news , which has contracts or agreements with mr gingrich , mr santorum , mike huckabee , the former governor of arkansas , and sarah palin , the former governor of alaska all have expressed interest in running for president , a decision that would require them to sever ties with the network on the network wednesday , bret baier , the political anchor , said the suspension of mr gingrich and mr santorum was effective for 60 days then on may 1 , their contracts will be terminated unless they notify fox that they are not running for president , he said the network said similar action would be taken against ms palin and mr huckabee as soon as they show some serious intention to form an exploratory committee the candidates are not the only ones ramping up , however state officials across the country are once again eagerly scheming to make sure the presidential contests come early enough in the political season to make a read difference for decades , iowa and new hampshire have insisted on being the two opening states of the presidential campaign more recently , south carolina and nevada have held onto early positions in the political calendar the iowa caucus is scheduled for feb 6 , with the new hampshire primary eight days later except for south carolina and nevada , all of the other states are supposed to wait until march to hold their contests but in minnesota , the republican party is insisting on a feb 7 date for its caucus , just a day after iowa s florida republicans have scheduled their primary for jan 31 a poke in the eye to the four states that traditionally hold the early contests in an interview wednesday as he arrived in washington , mr strawn said iowa would reject those efforts in my conversations with colleagues in new hampshire and south carolina , the early states will do what we need to do to maintain our traditional role as the leadoff states , mr strawn said we certainly reserve the right to do what s necessary if that sounds like a threat , it is mr strawn and his counterparts in new hampshire have made it clear that they will move the dates of their contests up to make sure that they are first the hopscotching in 2008 ended only when the iowa caucus was scheduled for jan 3 we are monitoring the situation , mr strawn said there s time for states to get in compliance with the rnc rules those rules are fairly strict this year states that improperly schedule their contests before march 1 risk losing the ability to seat their delegates at the national convention in the summer of 2012 the ultimate loss of influence in picking the party s nominee but beyond that , the republican national committee has threatened that states could find themselves in less desirable hotels during the convention and without guest and vip passes to hand out as mr strawn put it that is a problem for state party leaders trying to figure out how to keep people happy in addition to meeting with reporters on thursday , mr strawn is in washington to meet with national party leaders in the hopes that they can avert a messy dispute playing out in the press like it did four years ago i am hopeful , he said , that states still have the time to be in compliance with those rules
sandwich , england will there be any beer left in northern ireland \? one has a right to wonder after darren clarke gave his small homeland another big reason to celebrate sunday with a threestroke victory at the british open at royal st george s last month , clarke actually withdrew from a tournament so he could party with the 22yearold rory mcilroy , the newly crowned champion whom clarke has supported and advised during his rapid rise from junior phenom to professional threat now , it will be mcilroy s turn to raise a glass in honor of clarke s first major title , or perhaps he can just take a sip from the claret jug that clarke now has in his strong hands i'm fond of a little beverage , and with the ra s permission , there might be lots of nice irish black stuff in this trophy this evening , clarke said in his remarks on the 18th green northern irishmen , whose homeland has a population of less than two million , have now won three of the last six majors graeme mcdowell at the 2010 united states open , mcilroy at the 2011 united states open and now clarke the stars had never aligned for clarke at a major , in part because of his own limitations and in part because of the challenges life has dealt him his wife , heather , died in august 2006 from breast cancer , leaving clarke to care for their two young sons late last year , he proposed to his countrywoman alison campbell , whom clarke met on a blind date organized by northern ireland s other major winner , mcdowell campbell was in tears beside the 18th green on sunday as clarke finished off his victory with a tapin for bogey golf is a sport of long careers and multiple opportunities , and clarke has successfully changed his legacy exceptionally late in the game no man has required more open championship appearances than clarke s 20 before winning the title i guess i'm a little bit different than everybody else , are n't i , clarke said with a laugh how long will this party last \? very long , he told british radio and i 'll be very , very hung over it was not as impolitic as his playing down the ryder cup as an exhibition , a point of view that rory mcilroy has since revised but mcilroy did not exactly embrace the traditional challenge of the british open after finishing 12 shots off the lead with a sevenover total of 287 among his indignities on sunday was the penalty stroke he was given after his ball moved on the seventh green in the strong winds after he had grounded his putter behind it my game is suited for basically every golf course and most conditions , but these conditions , i just do n't enjoy playing in , really , he said , later explained that there was no point in changing his game for one week a year in an attempt to prepare for a foulweather open i 'd rather wait for a year of nice weather and take my chances there , he said dustin johnson s breakthrough will have to wait a little longer johnson , a 27yearold american , must live with a collapse at last year s united states open at pebble beach , where he blew a threestroke lead with an 82 he must live with missing out on a playoff at last year s pga championship , where he did not bother to read the rules about those obscure bunkers at whistling straits and took a twostroke penalty for grounding his club on the 72nd hole now , he will have to live with picking the wrong club and hitting a poor shot on no 14 that led to a double bogey , ruining any hope of snatching the claret jug it was brutal out there , said johnson , who had a twoover 72 that left him tied for the runnerup spot with phil mickelson johnson was not the only american on the leader board , but none of them could chase down darren clarke mickelson made the most impressive charge before he staggered to the end with four bogeys rickie fowler , chad campbell and anthony kim tied for sixth , five shots off the pace , giving the united states five of the top seven finishers none of them occupied the only spot that really matters , extending an american drought that already was the longest in the grand slam era to six in a row
herman cain just went all in after a news conference devoted to the sexual harassment allegations that have been dogging his candidacy for the republican presidential nomination , mr cain left himself absolutely no wiggle room he said all of the harassment allegations against him were absolutely false he said he had no recollection of sharon bialek , the woman who was the first to go public with her charges \( he said i don t even know who this woman is \) that means mr cain has pretty much staked his credibility on no part of her story being true that she came to him for career advice , that they had drinks and dinner together , that he paid to have her hotel room in washington upgraded and it means that at least three other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct are also flatout lying mr cain seemed genuinely indignant at his news conference today , but his performance was undermined by some rather bizarre moments , starting with the pompous introduction he got from his attorney , who made some irrelevant remarks about his experience with victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault and mr cain went on and on about a democrat machine conspiring to keep him out of the white house because he is a businessman that made him sound a tad nutty finally , mr cain could not restrain himself from attacking ms bialek s character he accused her of attacking him for financial reasons , and repeatedly noted that she has had financial problems appearing with gloria allred , the celebrity lawyer , may not have been the best decision but none of this has any bearing on whether her allegations are true of the other three women in this case , the times today interviewed one , karen kraushaar , who mr cain admits filed charges against him and received a settlement from the national restaurant association , which he was running at the time but she provided no details of her complaint a lot will depend on what she and the other two women eventually have to say

the language rick perry used to describe social security in a usa today opinion article on monday was anything but inflammatory and strikingly different in tone than his recent book and statements on the campaign trail we must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix social security and make it financially viable for generations to come , he wrote in the short piece for the newspaper compare that to what mr perry wrote on page 61 of his book , fed up !  ponzi schemes like the one that sent bernard madoff to prison are illegal in this country for a reason , mr perry wrote , not mincing any words in a tough comparison they are fraudulent systems designed to take in a lot of money at the front and pay out none in the end this unsustainable fiscal insanity is the true legacy of social security and the new deal that rhetoric has stirred controversy among some of his fellow republicans who worry that it would make it tougher for him to defeat president obama if he becomes the party s nominee what he said may be technically true , mike huckabee , a former presidential candidate and governor of arkansas , said on a radio show on monday but you go to south florida , mr huckabee continued , where you have a lot of retired people and essentially say social security is a criminal enterprise , that s problematic but since becoming a candidate , mr perry has repeatedly declined to back away from the book s more inflammatory oratory about social security in fact , he has since called the program a monstrous lie , saying that politicians are not telling young people the truth about the program s future in an interview monday , mr perry s spokesman reiterated that point don t look for him tonight , tomorrow or a year from now to back away from anything he s said , mark miner , the spokesman , said the public wants people to start talking straight with them we re not going to change words or sugarcoat things for the sake of an election pressed on the difference in tone , mr miner insisted that mr perry will not back away from any of his earlier remarks and writings when it comes to social security the governor doesn t run from what he says , mr miner said there is no plan to run from this issue and yet the article in usa today seems to be a departure , at least in tone in the book , he wrote that social security was the best example of programs that are violently tossing aside any respect for our founding principles of federalism and limited government in the usa today article , he wrote that americans must come together and agree to address the problems so today s beneficiaries and tomorrow s retirees really can count on social security for the long haul in the book , he complained that social security is something we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now in the usa today article , he said that social security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected for younger workers , we must consider reforms to make social security financially viable in the book , he wrote that by any measure , social security is a failure in usa today , he said that we must have a frank , honest national conversation about fixing social security in the book , mr perry also acknowledges the kind of political attacks he would get and is now getting because of his words now , if you say social security is a failure , as i have just done , you will inherit the wind of political scorn , he wrote in the book , which was published a year ago seniors might think you want to cut the benefits they have paid for politicians will seek to take advantage , stirring up fear about benefits that will be lost if you elect another heartless republican i get it the implication in that passage is that a politician should stick to his guns on the social security message so far , he s done that but the usa today article suggests there might be room for a bit of a change in tone , if nothing else tonight s debate could be very interesting
it has long been clear that the federal debt limit is far too dangerous and unstable for lawmakers to use as a political weapon allowing that to happen in the last few traumatic weeks created an artificial national crisis that put the economy and the savings of americans at risk and helped produce a loss of confidence that lingered as a cause of  none of that , however , has stopped republican leaders , who announced this week that they intend to repeat this explosive episode over and over , in perpetuity with the bad memory still fresh , president obama should quickly seize the opportunity to make clear that he will not allow it even once more , never mind permanently instead of raising the debt ceiling every few years , it s time to eliminate this dangerous game once and for all as this page not remotely for the first time or the last the debt limit does not limit the debt it s an illusion of a law , instituted in world war i , to persuade gullible taxpayers that congress is exercising responsible oversight over borrowing congress already controls spending and taxation , and if it wants a smaller debt it can cut spending or raise taxes at will to allow the deficit to rise , and then refuse to pay for it months later , is the definition of financial irresponsibility but being irresponsible worked for republicans this time they refused to raise the limit without cuts in spending and won 25 trillion in cuts in the deal wrapped up on tuesday now they want to make permanent the arbitrary and simplistic standard devised by speaker john boehner a dollar of cuts for every dollar in the debt increase senator mitch mcconnell , the republican leader , that no president of either party should ever be allowed to raise the ceiling without having to engage in the kind of debate we 've just come through mr mcconnell may call it a debate , but what his party really did was threaten the economy with catastrophe in the blind pursuit of huge spending cuts with no tax increases he admitted that he saw the ceiling as a no president or voter should tolerate that level of disregard for the national good the debt limit should ideally be dispensed with , but , at a minimum , it can no longer be held for ransom the president and congress are free to continue talks to reduce the deficit , but not while the economy is dangling in the balance the president should assemble a coalition of business leaders , mayors , governors and ordinary americans ready to spend the next year explaining to voters why the debt limit should be eliminated , or blunted as a tool to change budgetary policy if democrats continuously remind the country how dangerous this path is , republicans may think twice about repeating it if they do not , mr obama could meet their challenge with a legal threat the white house has repeatedly demurred when asked if a provision of the 14th amendment could be used to declare the debt ceiling invalid , saying it was an untested theory there is more than a year for administration lawyers to find ways to put it into practice the 14th amendment , adopted during reconstruction , says the validity of the public debt of the united states cannot be questioned threatening the economy with calamity to achieve partisan goals does just that president obama should use every power at his disposal to fend off republicans' irresponsible threats and invite them to meet him in court if they want to resist
mission , tex on the last night of his life , joaquin luna jr , 18 , filled the pages of a spiral notebook with goodbyes in brief letters to relatives , friends and teachers , he asked one of his brothers to take care of his nephews and his niece and told a friend he had left a memento for her in his bible one letter was different from the rest it was addressed to jesus christ , and in it he asked for forgiveness jesus , he wrote , i 've realized that i have no chance in becoming a civil engineer the way i 've always dreamed of here so i'm planning on going to you and helping you construct the new temple in heaven in the days since mr luna took his own life last month and since some of his writings became public , his story of an illegal immigrant who suddenly lost hope of becoming the first in his family to go to college has evolved into something more to the immigrant rights movement in texas , mr luna has become a symbol of the psychological toll that being in the country illegally can take on young people to others , he has become a political pawn , with his death being used by those who support the passage of the dream act , which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who go to college still others have questioned what role , if any , mr luna s status played in his suicide although his relatives claimed that he committed suicide because of the pressure he felt , none of the letters mentioned his illegal status in his letter to jesus , he suggested that another issue was troubling him , saying he was fearful to fall in any temptation , though he did not elaborate but beyond the reasons for his death , mr luna s suicide has had an impact far past the border towns of the rio grande valley it has given other illegal immigrants in high school and college the courage to speak out about their own depression it has also thrust a lowincome family of immigrants into the national spotlight and put a troubled teenager s final letters at the center of the immigration debate , with relatives , activists , politicians and reporters dissecting them seeking evidence for or against the family s claims mr luna was a shy , lanky young man who played guitar in church bands and helped care for his diabetic mother near the border in , one of the poorest counties in america , where 352 percent of the population lived below the poverty level in 2009 his neighborhood is a rural , ragged place , with rundown trailer homes and graffititagged street signs the skyline is dominated not by tall buildings but by windswept palm trees that tower over dirt yards , stray dogs and citrus groves mr luna , who was born in reynosa , mexico , and came to the united states as an infant , was not like most teenagers in mission he drew the blueprints that were used to build his mother s new house and spoke often of becoming either an architect or a civil engineer he joked that he did not have time for a girlfriend , spending many weekends mowing lawns to pay for his electric guitar and lessons at benito juarezabraham lincoln high school , he was ranked 89th out of 467 students in the senior class in recent weeks , administrators at the school and several people close to mr luna said he had given no indication that anything was wrong but on nov 25 , the day after thanksgiving , he put on a maroon shirt and a tie , lay down next to his mother and told her he was sorry he was never going to be the person he wanted to be , relatives said then he went into the bathroom , put a handgun underneath his chin and pulled the trigger mr luna s family told local reporters that he had killed himself because of the despair he felt over his immigration status as he was applying to colleges and that he had been affected by the senate s failure to pass the dream act last year at that point , relatives had not read mr luna s letters because the hidalgo county sheriff s office had confiscated them as part of its investigation the story was quickly seized on by supporters of the dream act college students in austin painted posters reading i am joaquin at a vigil honoring mr luna in los angeles , mourners listened to a message recorded by his relatives in washington , a texas congressman , representative rub n hinojosa , a democrat from edinburg , of mr luna on the floor of the house and urged congress to pass the dream act guadalupe trevi o , the hidalgo county sheriff , said that mr luna s death had been ruled a suicide , but that investigators had not established a motive i'm very disappointed that some folks , and even some of our elected leaders , have exploited and politicized this young man s ill decision to take his own life , especially when we have found no evidence that points to any particular motive , sheriff trevi o said nobody knows why he did it only he knows for sure why he did what he did the sheriff s office provided the letters to the family on dec 2 relatives said that even though the letters failed to mention the issue , they continue to believe that mr luna committed suicide because of his immigration status , based on their conversations with him and the references in the letters to his failure to realize his dreams we lived with him , so we know , and it does n't matter what other people say , said one of mr luna s brothers , diyer mendoza , 35 , a truck driver who has become the family spokesman every time he would put in an application , the first thing that would pop up was are you a us citizen \? ' no resident \? ' no number \? ' no it was all just mounting and mounting on top of him i truly believe that if that dream act would have already passed , he would still be here today as it became clear that the letters mentioned neither immigration nor the dream act , immigrant rights advocates went on the defensive as their conservative opponents attacked their handling of the issue on its web site , said the claims about mr luna s suicide had been proven as a hoax by desperate and unscrupulous illegal immigrant invasion supporters the , which organized the vigil there , issued a statement saying it believed that the family was not being dishonest and was not exaggerating a spokeswoman for mr hinojosa said he stood by his remarks because of statements the family made to his staff the congressman has no reason to doubt what the family has said , said the spokeswoman , patricia guillermo greisa martinez , a senior at texas am university and the coordinator of the , said the contents of mr luna s letters had not reduced the effect his suicide had on students who are in the country illegally we can all share in that pain and that angst that he felt at that moment , because we 've all been there , said ms martinez , 23 , who is an illegal immigrant one of the colleges mr luna applied to was the university of texaspan american , in nearby edinburg for a school project , he wrote that he wanted to attend the university because it was close to home and inexpensive mr luna was accepted , but he never found out he died before his admission became official
in a manhattan courtroom last week , federal prosecutors played for a jury a secretly recorded telephone conversation between two wall street traders exchanging stock tips two days later , one of those traders , ephraim g karpel , hanged himself in his fifth avenue office , according to a law enforcement official mr karpel was never charged with any wrongdoing , and until last week his name had not emerged in connection with the government s vast investigation of insider trading yet while working for a new york commodities firm , he had agreed in 2008 to cooperate with federal authorities , and for about a year he taped conversations with fellow traders , according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss it the government s investigation changed his life forever and was his unraveling , fran karpel , his wife , said in a telephone interview from her home in livingston , nj he sank deeper and deeper into a hole and could n't see a way out federal prosecutors' increasingly aggressive and public stance in pursuing insider trading has led to headlinegrabbing convictions and steppedup compliance procedures at hedge funds but behind the scenes , the government s hardball investigative tactics using surveillance , pressuring witnesses and raiding offices have also spawned a culture of fear on wall street and affected the lives of many who have not been accused of any crimes whether the investigation played a role in mr karpel s death cannot be known he had been depressed after losing his job , his wife said , and other factors may have contributed but according to ms karpel , his death at age 50 came three years after a pair of agents from the federal bureau of investigation approached him outside the applejack diner , on the corner of 55th street and broadway the agents took him inside the restaurant and , seated at a table toward the back , told him they had evidence of his involvement in an insider trading network the government s supposed evidence included a telephone conversation between mr karpel and zvi goffer , a trader whose phone the fbi had tapped on the call , recorded on dec 31 , 2007 , mr karpel told mr goffer that the drugstore chain walgreens had made an offer to acquire matria healthcare i 've got the trade for the month of january for you , mr karpel said , according to a transcript of the call it s coming from a banker that call was one of more than 20 wiretapped conversations played during mr goffer s twomonth trial , which is now in jury deliberations the walgreens deal never happened , but the recorded conversation led federal authorities to approach mr karpel and seek his help in building insider trading cases it is unclear how investigators thought that mr karpel could help them ephraim was a very popular guy and knew a lot of people , his wife said he always called it a fishing expedition indeed , mr karpel had many wall street connections he worked for 18 years at mutual shares , an investment firm run by the fund manager michael f price , rising to the position of head trader mr karpel then left mutual shares to work as an analyst , a job he considered more cerebral and respectable he developed an expertise in metals and mining stocks after a stint at p schoenfeld asset management , mr karpel joined tigris financial group , a commodities firm run by the investor thomas s kaplan none of mr karpel s former employers has been accused of any wrongdoing over the past two years , the united states attorney s office in manhattan , which has led the federal investigative effort in this area , has charged 49 people with insider trading crimes thirtynine of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury , including raj rajaratnam , the billionaire hedge fund manager but the federal authorities' techniques have rarely been seen on wall street before late last year , fbi agents conducted three simultaneous raids of large hedge funds two of those funds have since closed and for the first time in an insider trading inquiry , the government has been using wiretaps a method typically reserved for drug crimes and organized crime cases to record the telephone conversations of wall street traders in one instance , the government came under official criticism for its wiretap practices earlier this year , judge richard j sullivan rebuked law enforcement officials for monitoring an intimate call between a trader and his wife , a conversation that was not germane to the trader s case the court is deeply troubled by this unnecessary , and apparently voyeuristic , intrusion , wrote judge sullivan , a federal judge in manhattan it was wiretaps that led the fbi to confront mr karpel on the street after the encounter , mr karpel retained daniel r alonso , then a partner at the law firm kaye scholer , who advised mr karpel to cooperate with the government mr alonso , now the chief assistant district attorney for manhattan , would neither confirm nor deny that he had represented mr karpel , citing legal ethics rules representatives of the fbi and the united states attorney in manhattan declined to comment ms karpel said mr alonso had counseled her and her husband to keep mr karpel s cooperation with the government quiet our lawyer said , 'you can only discuss this with me , your rabbi or your therapist , ' ms karpel said we did n't have therapists and we belonged to a synagogue but did n't want to talk to our rabbi , so we kept it a secret from everyone , even our family we were terrified , ms karpel added we had nobody to turn to ms karpel said her husband had been in horribly conflicted about his cooperation she said he had been so worried about entrapping his friends that he began cutting himself off from wall street contacts by mid2009 , the fbi began to lose interest in mr karpel , according to his wife , and stopped asking for his help around that time , however , his employer , tigris , learned of his involvement in the investigation , according to a firm spokesman tigris dismissed him , but he continued to work with the company as an outside consultant until his death in recent months , mr karpel had been in talks to join javelin partners , a fledgling toronto firm that advises small mining companies he never joined the firm but had been subleasing space at javelin s new york office on lower fifth avenue , which is where he was found after he lost his job at tigris he became very depressed , ms karpel said he loved wall street and he loved his friends there , she said he felt like he had to reinvent himself this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo agents in boston last fall conducting one of three simultaneous raids on large hedge funds \( photograph by brian snyder reuters \) \( b4 \)
the economist s democracy in america blog has a very good illustration of the reasons our privatized , marketbased system is so much more expensive , for no better results , than everyone else s a medical technology company is going public to generate the money it needs to advertise its products to hospital directors and insurancecompany reimbursement officers this entails significant extra expenditures for marketing , the new stocks issued to fund the marketing will ultimately have to pay dividends , banks will have to be paid to supervise the ipo that was needed to generate the funds to finance the marketing campaign \( presumably charging the industrycartel standard 7 \) and all this will have to be paid for by driving up the price the company charges to deliver its technologies but beyond the added expense , why would anyone think that a system in which marketing plays such a large role is likely to be more effective , to lead to better treatment , than the kind of process of expert review that governs grant awards at nih or publishing decisions at peerreviewed journals \? why do we think that a system in which ads for claritin are all over the subways will generate better overall health results than one where a national review board determines whether claritin delivers treatment outcomes for some populations sufficiently superior to justify its added expense over similar generics \? what do we expect from a system in which , as propublica reports today , body imaging companies hire telemarketers to sell random people ct scans over the phone \? furthermore , the other key thing to pay attention to is who this marketing campaign was targeted at key decisionmakers at providers and insurance companies those are the people who decide whether medical procedures get ordered it s not patients patients aren t going to experience a loss of freedom or satisfaction because an expert reviewer at the independant payment advisory board makes the call as to whether a procedure is medically beneficial , rather than the corresponding bureaucrat at their insurance provider or at the forprofit clinic they re attending none of this is particularly new but it needs to be repeated , over and over again maybe some of it will leak through the ideological armor of very serious people
tennis has had a historically important , if sometimes forgotten , role in the history of video games as the us open concludes at flushing meadows , it s worth looking roughly 60 miles east of the usta billie jean king national tennis center , where one of the first video games ever made was a tennis game , created more than 50 years ago on long island tennis for two was dreamed up in 1958 at the brookhaven national laboratory in upton , which specializes in everything from nuclear physics to biosciences looking to show visitors what they were capable of doing , william higinbotham , the head of the lab s instrumentation division , collaborated with robert dvorak , a technical specialist they created a crude tennis simulator where a dot of light , representing a ball , sailed across a fiveinch oscilloscope screen a short vertical line represented the net , and a long horizontal line represented the ground to bat the ball with nonexistent rackets , players held a bulky metal box equipped with a dial and a button instead of being preserved for history , tennis for two eventually suffered a rather ignominious end after two years , the game was disassembled because the parts were needed for other projects in the 50 years following , tennis video games have continued being served up , with varying levels of success in 1972 , atari released pong designed as a table tennis simulation , pong was severely limited by most standards for instance , there was no net to come into play but pong took the basic tenets of tennis and ping pong and made them available to the masses as an arcade game a few years later , pong was available as a game that could be hooked up to a television at home when the atari 2600 exploded in the 1980s , activision tennis allowed home gamers to play a simplistic brand of tennis in the comfort of their own homes with the proliferation of home gaming systems in the 90s , several tennis stars were given eponymous tennis video games , from andre agassi to jimmy connors there was also jennifer capriati tennis , which was available for the sega genesis , and included tournaments seemingly designed to evoke classic tourneys without trespassing on trademarks \( eg the london open , the paris open \) mario tennis for the nintendo 64 had users play as cartoon characters , but did a surprisingly accurate job of replicating the pace and strategy involved with the sport  the nintendo wii , introduced in 2006 , seemed to promise an accurate way to translate tennis to gaming , allowing users to actually make their own moves in front of their televisions unfortunately , making wild swings in front of expensive flat screens make their own moves isn t always the best idea  despite the long shared history between tennis and video games , for whatever reason there has never been a tennis video game franchise that fully captured the imagination of the general sports gamebuying public thus far , games have largely been specialized , working well on one platform but perhaps not as well on another as a result , there has never been a tennis series prevalent on the level of madden , not to mention an iconic standalone game like mike tyson s punch out or nhl 94 this doesn t mean video game makers have stopped trying to hit a perfectly placed shot with no defining tennis game on the market , several of the largest companies in the video game world , including ea sports , sega and 2k sports , are still making a play to own the category 2k released topspin 4 in march sega released virtua tennis 4 in may the next promising release looks to be coming in 2012 , when ea has announced they ll port their wellreviewed grand slam tennis franchise from the wii to the xbox and playstation 3 watching tennis on television , it would seem like a sport that would translate easily to becoming a fun video game the court is a standard size the physics of a ball bouncing is largely unchanging players carry just one piece of equipment visually , there aren t any fancy camera angles required yet it seems the finesse and specialized skill that elevate the best tennis players in the world are difficult to replicate in a game facets of tennis like putting specific spin on shots and employing strategy in shot placement have never been completely translated into a tennis video game just as some people will be inspired to pick up a racket for the first time in years upon watching the us open , surely some sports video gamers will be moved to seek out a tennis game there are plenty of options , many of them good , none of them perfect
baghdad the ministry of health here is campaigning to ban the sale of guns in toy guns , that is baghdad s toy markets are stocked with plastic weapons in all prices and sizes toy guns , tanks , knives , uniforms , even silencers in a country where guns and military gear are heartbreakingly prevalent , basic training begins early it s the responsibility of the community to get rid of these toys , said dr emad abdulrazaq , national adviser for mental health at the ministry they make it easier for a child to make the next step to real violence , because every day he enjoys guns the ministry , which itself has no authority to regulate toy sales , has urged the government to ban all toy weapons but for now it is concentrating on one a cheap plastic air pistol highly popular among boys that fires plastic pellets and has been the source of hundreds , possibly thousands , of eye injuries dr kudair altai , head of the technical department at ibn alhaytham hospital , the country s main eye hospital , is one of those waging the campaign on a recent morning , dr tai examined the eye of a 5yearold boy named mustafa , searching for scratches or internal bleeding in late november , during id aladha , the islamic feast of sacrifice , the boy was playing with his neighbors when one of them fired an air pistol , hitting him in the eye the boy looked alright , but for seven days he cried and could not sleep finally , his father took him to the eye hospital , where dr tai discovered a yellow plastic pellet the size of a small pea lodged between his eyeball and the surrounding socket there was bleeding in the eye s interior chamber and partial dislocation of the iris he was lucky , dr tai said many children suffer much worse injuries from the pellets during the fiveday celebration of id aladha , when families give children money to buy toys , dr tai said , he often sees several injuries from pellet guns a day , some severe enough to require surgery this year he went on television to advise parents not to buy the guns the problem is not with the parents who purchase these toys but with the merchants that import such kind of toys , dr tai said because the toys are popular , parents cannot resist their children s persistence , he said he said he had seen toy air pistols with a range of 50 yards children here live amid the impact of real violence , both on the news and in their neighborhoods during the height of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007 , bodies often remained on the streets for days before being collected few children have access to psychiatric care , which is deeply stigmatized iraqi families are often large , and the children share rooms with their parents , so they are not sheltered from adult television or conversation both of which commonly refer to horrific violence , theatrical or real we have our own horror scenes , we do n't need extra , said a hospital ward matron , who asked not to be named because she was not authorized to talk to reporters it should all be banned , any fireworks the other day i started shouting at neighborhood kids who were shooting at each other but at least they shot at each other s legs , so they would n't hurt their eyes at the markets on karada street , where pellet guns sold for 8 or less , merchants said toy guns were their most popular the culture of violence is dominant , said one shop owner , hussein mohammed , who declines to sell pellet guns children are no longer interested in educational games , he said at his store all they want to play with is the games that express power and violence teachers said that living with so much violence in both their real and fantasy lives had made students quicker to fight and less patient with their studies where students used to ask teachers to help resolve conflicts , now they rarely do so , said instisar mohammed , a primary school teacher in the yarmouk neighborhood , where most residents are relatively well educated they resolve with their fists more easily , she said they fight a lot more than they used to she added that after 15 minutes in the classroom they do not pay attention anymore and start moving around , then fighting a ban on toy weapons is unlikely because it would require action by a number of ministries , none of them responsible for public health but the trade ministry is in talks with health experts about a ban on some imports , a ministry spokeswoman said mustafa , who was shot in the eye , said he no longer talked to the neighbors who shot him i do n't like them , he said when he grows up , he said , he wants to be an ophthalmologist his father , raad kharaibut , 62 , said he had tried to persuade the neighbors not to allow their children to play with the guns , but to no avail i do n't bring home such things because i know they are harmful , he said we 've seen similar incidents guns are not nice and not civilized toys even without the toys , he said , his son would be growing up in a martial culture the child sees checkpoints , he sees the military stop traffic , he said the soldier has the gear , he has the right to express his power the boy wants to be like that the larger danger , though , is that a childhood spent among guns , real and toy , will make children more likely to embrace any use of power , dr abdulrazaq said in the short term , it makes them more hostile at home and in school , he said they become more cruel in the long term , it will encourage them to engage in more adventures with weapons he will be more vulnerable to be recruited by police , criminals or terrorists real guns , he said , will be an enjoyment , not a stress but for many parents , the question of whether to have toy guns at home rests on more immediate considerations they like it , said saddam abdulsalam , who buys toy guns for his six children , though one shot his brother in the eye even his three daughters play with the guns this is the new generation , he said they will grow out of it

with the end of monday night s bcs national championship game comes the end of the college football season , which for sports fans everywhere means a huge dropoff in their weekly sports diets as with any effective diet , the answer isn t to go cold turkey \( unless you re going atkins , which in that case the answer probably includes plenty of cold turkey \) the idea is to make a slow and steady transition one that will hold but with the nature of college football \( and sports in general \) that s not possible you re forced to go from the pinnacle of bowl season one day to watching nothing but talking heads the next , and that s not the healthiest way to fill the loss in football programming sure , there s enough talk about the coaching carousel , recruiting and the draft to placate your average college football fan , but for schoolcolorbleeding diehards it s only a matter of time before the wheels fall off and they re dvring jersey shore episodes and renting the third installment of twilight a successful transition needs to have two characteristics it needs to be realistic and it needs to be gradual it s been established that there s nothing gradual about the end of a sports season it s like valentine s day it has tons anticipation , is over before you know it , and ultimately leaves you feeling empty inside making the transition then becomes a case of finding a realistic substitution for most college sports fans , that realistic substitution is college basketball , and for good reason it s another high profile sport with topflight athletes , and by this time all the powerhouses are done eating their nonconference cupcakes and have moved on to their tougher conference schedules still , for some \( those diehards again \) that s not enough no matter how hard they try , nothing will replace the thrill and excitement of the football season they just can t let go here s my advice don t let go i m not saying you should invite your friends over every saturday and watch games on replay or tailgate in empty parking lots i m saying you need to trick yourself you need to give yourself a placebo you technically shouldn t be able to give yourself a placebo , but let s go ahead and try to anyway the solution , again , starts with college basketball \( hear me out \) , but this time let s think of it in terms of college football you don t think that makes sense \? sure it does think of all the players past and present who have played both college football and basketball charlie ward , julius peppers , randy moss , tony gonzalez , jimmy graham , greg paulus , antonio gates , ronald curry , etc and although more and more athletes choose to specialize and focus on one sport , it doesn t mean that there aren t some out there that would be good candidates for a football makeover so here s the game next time you watch college basketball , see if you can heighten your enjoyment by playing the role of football scout after getting distracted by all the suitable tight end candidates , try to make the game a little harder look for quarterbacks look for fullbacks look for linebackers if you really want to spice it up , look for entire groups here are some examples best secondary missouri tigers the tigers have four players that average at least 15 steals per game and two of those four are above the 20 mark michael dixon \( 61 23 spg \) and marcus denmon \( 63 20 spg \) make dribbling and passing an unpleasant experience for any team is it crazy to think that they couldn t translate some of those skills to the gridiron \? in fact , after a little internet research , i stumbled upon this interesting tidbit on missouri s athletic website regarding denmon lists football as his hidden talent off the basketball court and was a standout receiver and defensive back at hogan prep holy smokes best passing game pittsburgh panthers the panthers lead the country in assists per game \( 204 apg \) , but that s not the only reason they get the nod as the best potential football air attack at the end of the day , you need that one guy the quarterback to make the calls , make the reads , and make the plays for the pitt panthers , that guy is brad wanamaker at 64 , 210 pounds , wanamaker isn t too far off from ideal quarterback size and with 53 apg and a 23to1 assist to turnover ratio not to mention he s a senior with experience he seems like a guy you could trust under center \( while hoping that he can actually throw a football \) best line game ohio state buckeyes at first i was going to ignore linemen i don t have anything against linemen and i hear they make great husbands , but my initial reaction was that if a player was honestly a good line candidate \( tight ends and defensive ends not included \) , then he probably wasn t doing a great job as a basketball player thankfully i was wrong going through the top 25 , i couldn t find a duo with a better combination of size and agility than the buckeyes jared sullinger \( 69 , 280 \) and dallas lauderdale \( 68 , 255 \) that s a lot of beef and they both seem to have the frames to add even more mass best running game uconn huskies this category really shouldn t ignore the offensive line but it has to kemba walker is barry sanders in basketball shoes how you start a fast break when the other nine players have already passed half court i ll never know kemba knows or maybe he doesn t i have a feeling he just does it and doesn t ask questions why stop and think about why you re quicker and faster than everyone else when you can just be quicker and faster than everyone else \? i think you could add thirty pounds to his frame and he wouldn t lose that much yeah , good luck tackling that it s most likely that none of these players will ever end up playing football that s not the point the point is that a little fantasy never hurt anyone a little fantasy is healthy after tonight , when that separation anxiety starts to set in , give the game a shot add your own rules use your football knowledge see if it helps see if you can spot the next antonio gates first person to find a kicker gets bonus points first person to find a long snapper gets a trophy and if it doesn t help , take refuge in knowing that spring practice is only a couple months away
as a consultant for an expert network , winifred jiau stood at the nexus of a scheme to leak the valuable secrets of companies to hedge funds for a sizable profit , a federal prosecutor said thursday during opening statements at her trial on insider trading charges she wheedled inside information from sources she referred to in code as cooks , passed their recipes , or tips on to her hedge fund clients , then waited for the sugar , or money , the prosecutor , david leibowitz , told a jury in a packed united states district court room in lower manhattan ms jiau s lawyer countered that the information might not have been public , but it hardly met the threshold of inside information ms jiau s trial is the first to be brought by the government related to its crackdown on socalled expert networks , which connect informationhungry money managers with industry experts for a fee including ms jiau , 13 people have been charged with insider trading related to use of expert networks , eight of whom have pleaded guilty ms jiau s lawyer , joanna c hendon , acknowledged that her client trafficked in nonpublic information , sometimes given to her by corporate executives she also did not dispute that her client used the code to discuss it what mattered , ms hendon said , was that none of the secret information was material , or important enough to move a company s stock price possession of nonpublic material information is required to convict someone of insider trading charges none of that evidence really matters , ms hendon told the jury just because some of the information was nonpublic does n't mean it was inside information the prosecution noted its evidence in the case included three recorded phone calls between ms jiau and samir barai , a hedge fund manager who has pleaded guilty to charges of insider trading and is cooperating with the government \( mr barai , who is hard of hearing , often recorded calls so he could listen to them afterward \) ms hendon argued that the only reason the government was prosecuting ms jiau was because of the recordings , which happened to be around because mr barai had an especially difficult time understanding her client s thick mandarin accent in addition to those calls , mr leibowitz , said the government s case was bolstered by documents , trading records and emails he noted a march 2008 email exchange between ms jiau and mr barai , in which she congratulated him on starting his hedge fund , barai capital management having worked with mr barai before , she suggested they resume their relationship , but said there would be new costs to pay for her two secured sources , who could supply the actual numbers to a decimal point ms jiau is also accused of leaking secret information to noah freeman , a former portfolio manager at sac capital advisors , the hedge fund run by billionaire steven a cohen mr freeman , who has pleaded guilty , is expected to testify as early as friday ms jiau sat quietly throughout the proceeding , occasionally flipping through a huge binder on the defense table in her opening statement , ms hendon took pains to show jurors a more sympathetic side of her client , offering something between a biography and personal ad she told of ms jiau s arrival in america nearly 20 years ago from her native taiwan , and how she later decided to try her hand at consulting for an expert network ms hendon also mentioned ms jiau s golden retriever , hunter , and implored the jury to send her client home to her dog ms jiau is being held at the metropolitan correctional facility this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

on sunday , fans watching the new york city marathon will see elite runners finishing the race in just over two hours , legions of teams running for charities and people from around the world embracing the city one step at a time a far less distinguished mass of thousands of runners will also work their way through the fiveborough course together , they make the race , with its roughly 45 , 000 entrants , a spectacle like none other in sports but individually , they will hardly be noticed by anyone other than their friends and family robert shurman , 68 , is part of that silent majority he runs only one marathon a year , does not run for a cause , and does not wear a halloween costume to attract attention yet in his own modest way , he represents the heart and soul of the event he s a native new yorker who runs to stay in shape , and loves the communality of the race and his hometown this year , he will compete in his 29th consecutive new york city marathon , a remarkable feat considering the possibility of injuries , family events and other conflicts yet few will notice his achievement he is still seven races short of the current record holder i m not one of these gungho runners , said shurman , who has broken four hours in all but one of his marathons it s become a reward and celebration if i can maintain my fitness throughout the year shurman began running to keep in shape when he was in his late 30s and living in new jersey when his jogging partner decided to run the marathon , i thought he was certifiable , shurman said yet three years later , nearing 40 years old , shurman signed up himself , calling his decision to run midlife challenge no 7 he finished his first race in 3 hours , 35 minutes , and worked each year to improve his time , ultimately setting a personal best of 3 14 as the years have gone by , his times have slowed to around 3 55 yet shurman has learned to use the race as the carrot that keeps him running , and savors finishing the race as reward enough shurman subscribes to the lessismore philosophy he runs every other day for about an hour starting in the late summer , he adds 15 minutes to his long runs until he has built up to four hours he then works his way back down to two hours in the weeks before the race he trains in central park , on the trails up and down the hudson and east river and along the beach in montauk , where he has a second house he runs alone without listening to music it s private time , time to think , said shurman , a financial industry consultant who moved back to manhattan 10 years ago he developed the routine himself and it has worked he said he has a resting pulse of 40 , has maintained his weight at about 160 pounds for the last 30 years and has the same suit size to prove it he eats pasta five times a week , but follows no crash diets he has avoided major injuries by scaling back his workouts whenever something starts to hurt shurman admits that his story is not unique , but he remains devoted to the race that has given him so much joy he loves hearing so many foreign languages being spoken at the starting line , running through brooklyn , where the crowds are thick and noisy , and spotting the occasional celebrity like p diddy running with his bodyguards the design of the tshirts given out by the new york road runners could be nicer , he said , and the conditions at fort wadsworth in staten island aren t great but where else you can run seminude through the streets of new york with a police escort \? he asked as usual , his wife , two children and their families will be waiting for shurman , who will wear bib number 8227 this year if he has anything to say about the matter , they will be waiting for him for many years , too when i can t run it , i ll walk it and then i ll crawl it , shurman said the challenge is to just keep doing these as long as i can
washington has never been much of a partisan his former colleagues at never knew which politicians he voted for he complained privately that he felt the magazine s coverage of the 2008 election the one that put his current boss in the white house was too lopsided toward  he lacks the pugnacious demeanor that so many of his predecessors at the white house press secretary s lectern have worn like a badge in fact , he is so softspoken that sound technicians in the white house briefing room sometimes have to crank up the volume when he speaks when named mr carney , 45 , as white house press secretary in january , it struck many in washington as an unconventional pick he entered politics from journalism just two years ago , when he went to work as vice president s communications director there his work was largely behind the scenes no daily press interrogations or international crises to help defuse he never became a member of the obama inner circle like the former press secretary , robert gibbs , had but to those who know mr carney best , the move made perfect sense mr carney , they said , always seemed comfortable around people in power and exuded a certain confidence that endeared him to some of the biggest players in politics his polish is now being given a baptismbyfire test as the arab world seethes with unrest , japan faces nuclear catastrophe and the threat of a government shutdown looms he s able to put people at ease , said eli attie , a close friend of mr carney s and a former political operative who now writes television scripts he recalled the time he introduced his friend to richard a gephardt , his former boss not long after , time sent mr carney on a trip with mr gephardt , a former democratic congressman from missouri the day of the trip , mr attie s phone rang the two of them called me from the tarmac just to say hi , mr attie said he already had a close enough rapport with the guy when mr carney s editors at time gave a party to celebrate his promotion to washington bureau chief in 2005 , mayor michael r bloomberg of new york insisted on delivering a toast a carney friend who is a close associate of the mayor had introduced them , and they quickly hit it off and when mr carney grew restless in his job at time , an old friend introduced him to the newly elected vice president , who was looking for the right communications director they , too , quickly clicked but among the reporters who cover the white house , the question is whether mr carney s connections are the right ones he does not report directly to the president as many other press secretaries have , but to the white house communications director , dan pfeiffer some are concerned that he will never have the access mr gibbs enjoyed as a hybrid counselorspokesman , a rarity among modern press secretaries a lot of reporters were given the impression that the president would come out and symbolically put his hand on jay s shoulder and say he has all the access he needs , said peter maer , a white house correspondent for cbs news and unless i 've missed something , that has n't happened mr carney grew up in northern virginia he attended the lawrenceville school , an exclusive boarding school near princeton , and then yale but he did not have the blueblood , silverspooninmouth pedigree of many of his peers you 'd just assume his father was on the board of morgan stanley or was henry luce s best friend in some eating club , said john dickerson , who covered congress and the 2000 presidential campaign with mr carney for time none of that is true the two first came to know each other when mr carney was in moscow reporting for the magazine i just remember thinking he was not that much older than me and here he was in russia for time , and i was answering phones , mr dickerson , now a writer for slate , said if mr carney aggressively networked for the press secretary s job , his colleagues seemed unaware i think he quietly worked his way through the interview process , said bill burton , a former white house spokesman whose name was among those reportedly on the list of candidates to replace mr gibbs he impressed the right people at the opportune times mr carney is quick to acknowledge that his constitution is not one of more traditional press secretaries i come at this from having never been a partisan temperamentally , mr carney said in a recent interview his office still bore signs that the occupant had yet to fully move in empty picture frame hooks poked out from the walls the bookshelves were virtually empty how you engage , the tone and the style may be different from press secretary to press secretary , he said but i'm going to absolutely make clear why we think what the president is doing is right and when challenging people , i want to be civil , but i'm not going to back down mr carney took over from mr gibbs in midfebruary , and so far has avoided stepping into controversy he has been quickly expanding his fluency in the blandspeak that all press secretaries must master what about the explosive situation in libya \? it is being monitored closely how might the president respond \? all options are on the table does that include bombing \? there s no need to speculate every press secretary is entitled to a couple of months to hit his stride , said ann compton of abc news , who saw her first white house briefing in 1974 after gerald ford took office unfortunately , world events do n't always allow that to happen not that mr carney is always so placid dana milbank , a washington post columnist , recalled an email he received from mr carney while he was working for mr biden the subject line was you are a hack the email continued , fabrication is a legitimate tool for fiction you should try it it suits you as mr biden s top communications strategist , mr carney also gets some credit for helping polish the image of a politician who , until he became vice president , was often defined by impolitic slips of the tongue journalists who worked with him found him to be a cautious gatekeeper jay had a keen sense of his client and was appropriately protective of a gaffeprone vice president , said david remnick , editor of the new yorker , who requested an interview with mr biden for a book on mr obama mr carney denied the request mr carney is not so silent in another way he is the lead singer of a band a hobby and a passion second only to his devotion to the cult band guided by voices as for any tapes of mr carney actually singing , mr attie joked , the tapes ca n't be revealed because jay is an assistant to the president and they might be used for blackmail anyway , he said , there are a missing 18 minutes
washington the claim that corporations have personal privacy rights met with widespread skepticism on wednesday during a lively  a year ago , the court ruled in the that corporations and unions had a first amendment right to spend money in candidate elections but that decision , which involved a question of constitutional law , did not come up at the argument on wednesday , which considered the quite different issue of what congress meant when it exempted some files from disclosure under the  the exemption at issue in the case , federal communications commission v att inc , no 091279 , protects information that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy att invoked the exemption in seeking to block the release of documents it had provided to the fcc , which conducted an investigation into claims of overcharges by the company in a program to provide equipment and services to schools the documents were sought by a trade association representing some of the company s competitors the united states court of appeals for the third circuit , in philadelphia , had for the company , relying in part on a definition of person in the law that included corporations but several justices said it was too much of a leap to go from saying that corporations might be persons for some purposes to saying that their personal privacy could be invaded chief justice john g roberts jr said he could think of many instances where the adjective was very different from the root noun you have craft and crafty , he said totally different crafty does n't have much to do with craft squirrel , squirrelly right \? pastor and pastoral , he went on same root , totally different justice ruth bader ginsburg asked whether the fact that state , local and foreign government also fell under the statutory definition of persons meant that they , too , had personal privacy rights geoffrey m klineberg , a lawyer for att , said yes in 1981 , justice antonin scalia , then a law professor , told a senate committee that the exemption did not apply to corporations it was plain on wednesday that the intervening years had not caused him to change his mind can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the personal privacy of a corporation \? justice scalia asked mr klineberg do you have any examples from the new york times , from , you know , boswell , from anywhere , that anybody refers to the interests of a corporation as the personal privacy' of general motors \? mr klineberg said he was not aware of such a use of the phrase certainly in any statutory context justice scalia offered the lawyer for the government , anthony a yang , more help than he seemed to want , saying that exemptions in the freedom of information law should be read narrowly mr yang said he did not want to win on that ground , as the government often resists requests under the law we do not embrace that principle , mr yang said well , justice scalia responded , i'm not going to help the government s position if the government does n't want to be helped mr klineberg said it would be a mistake to allow the law to be a tool for an organization s adversaries to obtain access to harmful or embarrassing documents that do not inform the public about the government s activities for instance , he said , corporations have reputational interests in not having their disparaging remarks about regulators or customers disclosed to competitors a ruling against att , he said , could require disclosure of documents concerning , say , an environmental nonprofit organization talking about their political strategies for defeating an amendment to the  justice stephen g breyer asked for realworld examples of such disclosures , and mr klineberg said he was aware of none mr yang , seeming confident of victory , concluded his argument with a brief summary and sat down early att can provide no example of any problems that have arisen in over 35 years of the government s consistent administration of this provision , he said in fact , all indications point in simply one direction personal privacy applies only to individuals
billie joe armstrong plays many roles in american idiot , and that s before he even takes the stage at the st james theater mr armstrong , the 38yearold green day front man and guitarist and a cowriter of that broadway musical adapted from his band s hit album of the same title , rejoined the show on jan 1 to resume the role of st jimmy , the pugnacious , drugpushing alter ego of the protagonist , johnny \( portrayed by john gallagher jr \) \( charles isherwood s review of mr armstrong in american idiot appears in monday s new york times \) but in the final minutes before showtime on friday night , mr armstrong took on other parts from a nervous neophyte gingerly reviewing his notes from michael mayer , the musical s director and cowriter , to an extroverted jester prancing around the stage in a female costar s sequined dress in his dressing room furnished with the record albums of vintage punk acts like the avengers and generation x , and driedout bouquets suspended from the ceiling by their stems mr armstrong spoke with artsbeat about his experience as a performer in american idiot and about what the future might hold when he leaves the show after feb 27 these are excerpts from that conversation so what notes does michael have for you tonight \? he told me i was flat laughs that s his job yikes sounds like someone s going to wake up tomorrow with a broken guitar in his bed he goes over it every night i ve got a good rapport with him , so it s cool in this situation i have no choice i m a rookie i even have a hat that someone gave me that says rookie on it when you get older , it s good to feel like you re getting into uncharted territory how did the idea come up for you to perform in the show the first time \? we were having drinks one night i was with michael and that was the first time he brought it up i was like , yeah , sure then i was in buffalo with green day , we were getting ready to play a show , and michael called he goes , i really need to talk to you and i go , can you wait \? because i m getting in an elevator he goes , no , it can t wait i m on with tom hulce an american idiot producer , also then they officially asked me i was like , well , i can t say no sounds like something that i have to do even when you were developing the show , you weren t fantasizing about getting up on stage and joining in \? i was more a spectator than anything else that was as far as it was going to go i always liked how in the quadrophenia movie , it was the who s music , and it was cast with different people that was cool when they first asked me , i was like , am i too old \? to do the show at all , or to play st jimmy \? to play that character but since he s sort of an alter ego , he s sort of ageless he s supposed to be the embodiment of what johnny wishes he could be , so it should be ok if he s a little more , shall we say , mature or less mature you were noticeably pressshy during in the show , for in the fall was that by design \? the previous run was kind of like a test drive i didn t want to announce it i wanted it to be lastminute i wanted to get into rehearsal and figure out , can i do this \? am i capable of it \? i wanted to keep the pressure down as much as possible were you also concerned about how your coming into the show might be received by other cast members \? yeah , i was worried when me , mike dirnt and tr cool are on stage , it s three hams going crazy these people have been in plays and theater their whole lives they ve got tons of experience , and i ve had none that to me was really intimidating i also didn t want to come in and feel like it was some kind of vanity thing there s a funny story about george m cohan at the st james , he wrote , directed and starred in his own production i think it was the merry malones and it was written up as , george m cohan , who arrogantly wrote , directed and starred in his own production so that was going through my mind i was like , oh , god , i don t want to be that guy i never thought i d someday have a conversation with you about george m cohan you might want to factcheck that i hope i got the right person update commenter jfranklin shares more details about the merry malones did you have any previous experience with musical theater before you started performing in american idiot \? i had a vocal teacher when i was really young , like 7 , 8 years old , and that s how i sang , through standards and show tunes stuff from oliver ! and annie get your gun , things like that it taught me a sense of melody i was also really into ac dc was your teacher horrified that you grew up to become a punkrock star \? she was a really cool lady my mom keeps in touch with her , and she came to see american idiot in berkeley , which was really fun so you can have one foot in the world of punk rock and other in the world of musical theater at the same time \? i m old enough where i think you have to take everything you learn and put it in somehow and you can t escape your past it comes in handy , no matter what how did your band mates in green day feel about losing you to the show for a few weeks \? they were like do it we need to take a break get away from us for a while they re totally into it did you do any special training in preparation for your current run \? no i remember , i texted theo stockman , an ensemble member , and all i wrote was , by the way , how do you act \? and the response i got , was ha , ha , ha he goes just be yourself just be honest the first rehearsal was really funny michael says to me , ok , i m just going to tell you this right now , it s something i forgot to tell you this is going to be really awkward i was like , you couldn t have told me that a month ago \? the reporter is asked to leave the dressing room while mr armstrong changes into his costume mr armstrong emerges a few minutes later in one of the sequined dresses worn by the women in the number favorite son for a few minutes he dances around the other cast members who are performing their vocal warmups on the theater stage then mr armstrong returns to his dressing room and changes into pants the interview resumes i understand that s a regular preshow ritual for you \? i don t really know how to do their warmup thing so much the first day i came in , i was watching it and didn t really know what to do with myself i was like , hopefully i ll get a laugh out of them i ve also got this nurse s outfit indicates outfit on his clothing rack what do you do during your downtime from the show \? i have an apartment and i do demos during the day , just writing songs and stuff , and i have this night thing i like the fact that i can be on stage at night and be physical and in front of people , while i go home and write at the same time it s not like doing it in a tour bus are those songs that could turn up on another green day album \? right now , i m at a stage where it s just for fun i m not sure yet when i get home in march , i ll just hang out with my band mates , and we ll pick through the piles but i m always writing for the next green day record , for sure do you get to see your family at all \? yeah , they come off and on my wife s with me right now my kids were with me last week for a little bit i m going to go home for a week and then fly back , and they ll come meet me after a week of me being here by myself you try to split it up can i ask what part of the city you re living in \? oh , i don t want to go there but i assume you can still go incognito when you want to that s the beauty of new york there s a similarity between here and the bay area , people are very chill about things like that someone actually came up to me on the street once and said , i m being a terrible new yorker right now , but i really love your band that s all i wanted to say and that was it i was like , wow it was just nice it was no big deal are you finding any differences between performing in a rock concert in front of thousands of people , and performing in a broadway show , in front of a smaller audience with a different set of criteria \? playing a big rock gig at madison square garden is one thing , but to play in such an old theater and doing a stage production , it s just as massive i only get one moment to really acknowledge the crowd and that s at the beginning when i come out the rest of the time , i m on john and rebecca naomi jones i can t look at the audience that s the first time that s happened to me in my whole life , to not pay attention to them is this kind of performance something you think you might stick with \? would your rock n roll skills apply to it \? in your head , you re always thinking , how can i improve \? what can i do differently \? that s their craft i was making this analogy , that if you master one form of kungfu and you want to learn a different technique , that s almost what it feels like but i don t know , i m not a kungfu master laughs are there any other broadway shows you d like to see while you re in town , for the sake of comparison \? maybe if they stop closing down i wish i could have seen a lot of stuff that happened this last season i really wanted to see bloody bloody andrew jackson but i was never here long enough to have the time to do it , and it sounded like it was really cool since i m friends with the guys in u2 , i d like to see spiderman , but i m going to wait until it s ready to be seen i really want to see lombardi and i d like to see the future of some of the actors , because these guys are going places just to be able to watch what their next moves are and the next shows they re going to be in , i m excited to see that , too do you think about the longterm viability of american idiot \? it s performed very strongly in weeks when you ve been in the show , and struggled more when you haven t been in it can it keep going when your run ends \? i hope so i d like to see the integrity intact with the show i d like to see it have a really nice long run who wouldn t \? it s been almost a year now is that an important milestone for you , that it runs a year on broadway \? yeah it s huge i d love for a year now , and then i d like to see it for a couple more
nashville belmont s rick byrd and vanderbilt s kevin stallings hold the same job , in the same city , their offices separated by a fiveminute drive both coach basketball both run motion offenses both consider the vince gill a close friend together , they account for 48 years of head coaching experience \( 37 in nashville \) , 965 victories , 540 defeats , nine ncaa tournament appearances and two nearly unblemished graduation rates despite their proximity , longevity and shared history , neither would describe their relationship as a rivalry , not even a friendly one instead , and remain close friends , confidants , basketball bosom buddies continuing in perfect symmetry , both could enter the ncaa tournament with their deepest , most talented teams the friendship has been immeasurable for both of them , said gill , the third amigo to have someone five minutes away , who knows your struggles , what you 're going through well , it s perfect byrd arrived at belmont 25 years ago his team played in the naia , a country mile from division i his gym seated a few thousand as jordan campbell noted , gill is to belmont what spike lee is to the knicks , and gill recalled the handful of fans present at his first game to dispute one call , gill ran the length of the bleachers early on , byrd recognized a fertile recruiting ground in nashville and nearby he watched enrollment double , watched the university literally rise around him , and he decided that some things were more important than trying to climb the ladder he won games , lots of them he won 37 games in one season he won more than 500 games at belmont and more than 600 games in his career he won so much , in fact , that belmont moved up to division i in 199697 finally , byrd had the division i job he had long coveted at the university he had grown to love it felt perfect , until the losses , sometimes by 40 or 50 points , accumulated eventually , belmont joined the and opened the , the two most important elements in its successful jump while byrd struggled , vanderbilt hired its current coach in 1999 his name \? kevin stallings his \? belmont , of course byrd knew nothing about stallings but placed a courtesy call anyway their initial conversation centered on golf , courses played , best rounds the more they talked , though , the more they realized just how much they had in common we 're both a touch on the conservative side , stallings said we like humility , sportsmanship , small egos , country music we both play golf from similar interests , their friendship bloomed they met regularly for lunch , at pancake pantry or las palmas , where they diagrammed plays using salt and pepper shakers , forks and spoons they took golf trips \( byrd drilled two holes in one with stallings \) and advised each other in recruiting they went to concerts on gill s tour bus , with stallings , a guitar player , breaking down music instead of inbounds plays byrd says he seeks advice from stallings more than any coach outside his staff during the move to division i , stallings taught byrd defensive principles he learned from the dick bennett even now , stallings and byrd bounce plays back and forth , send text messages on game days , console each other after losses and commiserate about the grind both are perfectionists both are regarded as innovative offensive minds both struck gill as beyond intense what s really fun is to watch them play pingpong against each other , gill said they 're diving all over the place they 're sweating stallings played in college at purdue , became an assistant there , apprenticed at kansas under roy williams and took his first head coaching job at illinois state the vanderbilt team he inherited held a scattered history of tournament appearances the lance goulbourne said he knew more about the women s team before he came to vandy with his rumpled suits and horseshoe hairstyle , stallings bears little resemblance to his slick coaching compatriots in the southeastern conference in a year of scandal all around him \( bruce pearl at tennessee , cam newton at auburn , among others \) , stallings has followed the blueprint that produced two previous round of 16 appearances , with smart players steeped in fundamentals each of the commodores' eight losses came in close games , three in overtime they also overcame a series of injuries with a typically international roster jeffery taylor grew up in norrkoping , sweden , a place , he said , known for fishing and scenery goulbourne played tennis in brooklyn , even served as a ball boy at the for five years , before he chose basketball instead steve tchiengang played soccer in cameroon before he moved to houston in high school , and sometimes , he and goulbourne communicate in french their best player , though , is a local , john jenkins , from hendersonville , tenn the first time stallings watched jenkins in high school , he made eight straight 3pointers now , stallings calls jenkins , a conference player of the year candidate , the best pure shooter i 've ever coached belmont recruited jenkins , until it became clear he would attend a bigger college such is life for byrd at belmont , where his two favorite memories hang on the walls in the athletic offices one is a picture of the casey alexander , a former captain , the minute after the bruins clinched their first ncaa appearance , his mouth agape , jubilant the second is a framed newspaper article of belmont s seminal moment , a near upset of secondseeded duke as a no 15 seed in the 2008 tournament even now , byrd says someone asks him about that game every two or three days , and gill still remembers how the arena showered belmont with an ovation for a game it lost that game keeps byrd awake at night campbell said belmont outplayed duke that day byrd wished he called a better inbounds play , or picked a better defense but it was a great moment , he said one that , even though we lost , none of us will forget the duke game , and consecutive ncaa appearances from 2006 to 2008 , landed byrd the players on his current team , which , at 294 , represents easily the best performance in school history , he said coach byrd is a loyal person , guard ian clark said i'm sure he could have gone other places he had a vision for this school , and we want to help him realize it we want to win games in the tournament when byrd was honored for career win no 600 in february , stallings and gill sat in the stands , heckling the referees \( i yell all the stuff he ca n't , gill said \) stallings enjoyed that more than coaching against his friend should belmont qualify for the ncaa tournament by winning its conference tournament this week , it will join vanderbilt belmont could be seeded 12 to 14 vanderbilt \( 218 \) is closer to a 6 stallings described some players as not as confident as they deserve to be but took solace in the close nature of vandy s losses byrd rotates 11 players with little dropoff , the perfect recipe for pulling off an upset both teams , byrd said , are peaking at the right time both were also built gradually , the right way , we like to think in the coming weeks , byrd and stallings will discuss strategy , anxiety and opponents because their relationship is not a rivalry unless they meet in table tennis
cairo after a night of swirling confusion , president hosni mubarak has delegated his powers and authority to his deputy but not left office , the armed forces' plans are unclear and the egyptians who have risen up to bring down a repressive regime are bewildered and angry the potential for greater violence in egypt has risen in a 17minute speech on thursday night , mubarak acknowledged mistakes , promised reform and said , almost in passing , that his vice president , omar suleiman , was now in charge but he defied the demand of protesters that he quit once again , he gave the impression he had not heard them at all if egypt s battered authorities had set out to choreograph treacherous muddle , they could scarcely have done a better job early thursday evening , an immense cheer went up at tahrir square the egyptian armed forces , issuing what they call communiqu no 1 , declared that the demands of the egyptian people would be met there was no sign of the man who has long been their commander in chief , mubarak soon after , president obama made a statement suggesting mubarak s departure was , indeed , imminent what is absolutely clear is that we are witnessing history unfold it is a moment of transformation that is taking place because the people of egypt are calling for change , he said then , several hours after the army statement , mubarak appeared on state television he acknowledged mistakes for the first time , vowed to prosecute those responsible for hundreds of deaths over the past two weeks , promised reform of the constitution , and , without explaining why , said he had decided to delegate the powers and authority of the president to the vice president senior egyptian officials later said that meant all constitutional powers had been transferred and suleiman was de facto president a new chant went up in tahrir square we want to understand the speech ! both mubarak and suleiman once again blamed egypt s paralysis on foreign powers , attempted foreign diktats and lying foreign satellite channels out to deface the image of egypt the two men looked completely out of touch how does mubarak square his determination to prosecute those responsible for violence with the fact he oversaw that violence \? what do foreign powers have to do with a domestic crisis brought on by mubarak s farce of a november parliamentary election , growing corruption and his long refusal to meet growing demands for selfexpression and freedom \? how can this man who would not even admit that the uprising provoked his decision not to run in a planned september presidential election ever level with his people \? every concession from him has been grudging , belated and unconvincing was no exception there appear to be only two possible scenarios now an increase in the protests so overwhelming that mubarak , defiant soldier , is forced to go back on his vow to stay in office at least nominally until september or an army clampdown that forces people to do what suleiman requested go home a massive rally had been planned for friday before the speeches how it unfolds will say a lot about where an awakening egypt is now headed there is tremendous energy invested in bringing real change , but for most people the only guarantee of that change is mubarak s full departure a few hours before the army s announcement , i had met a 42yearold investment banker , exgoldman , with a good job in london and a nice place in south kensington he had watched the big jan 25 protest on tv , dropped everything , got a leave , and came out here to devote his energy to egyptian freedom it was a case , he says , of put up or shut up there are plenty like him , professionals fired up with their country s potential , sick of being told what to do by an old man he wrote this to me wednesday it s ironic , the west spent billions on egypt through ngos , government assistance , trying to help improve our education , improve the sense of civic responsibility , create civic society values , ownership , citizenship , human rights but they never realized that all they really needed to do was give us our freedom and in literally a day and a night you saw the transformation we would do all these things for ourselves , by ourselves if we felt enfranchised this revolution in values is startling it s been brought on by a sudden sense of ownership in the place of powerlessness cairo was the place of pushing and shoving and shouting and disorder par excellence now long lines form to enter tahrir square there are even separate garbage cans in the square for organic waste i also spoke to a 24yearold professional , perihane allam she was struck by the change in attitudes sexual harassment has been a big issue in cairo men were always hitting on me in the street , saying stuff , she said none of that in tahrir square , she told me , or elsewhere in the city these days dignity is transformative so is the discovery of an egyptian identity cutting across class and religious lines but after mubarak s speech , it seems all these gains are fragile
townies the most surreal or perhaps just confusing aspect of my new work space is the quietude at my old job at harper s magazine , people would congregate in the hallways kibitzing about books and politics , swapping gossip and jokes when deadlines loomed everyone retreated to their offices to complete their tasks when no one was looking , as if hard work was a vaguely unstylish matter best left to the imagination but here at green desk , a virtual office space in the dumbo neighborhood of brooklyn , conversation is d \? d \? most of the folks here work at jobs that have been represented to me a forced refugee from print publishing as exciting , borderline sexy and bristling with restless web 20 energy bloggers ! graphic designers ! an internet radio station with enough listeners that its dj can afford an office ! yet they all seem content to spend the day tapping away at their laptops in utter silence , the only aural distraction the lowtone hum of whichever indie rock anthem leaks from their headphones that i find all this disconcerting marks me as a newcomer but that s a role i'm ready to embrace the newnesswhichis n'tsurrealism is important to me , and i intend to maintain it even if it requires contriving ways to stay confused it reinforces the knowledge that my old job is over , and now i must immerse myself fully in this new one as a fulltime writer at work on a book rather than a fulltime editor trying to write a book at night theodore ross , excerpt from a beginner s guide to unemployment crisis points two days ago at around 10 am , members of the citizens' committee stood on one side of the street on the other , a group of attackers armed with machetes , sticks , molotov cocktails and stones one of these kids , no more than 17 years old , managed to mount the roof of the building next to ours and started hurling stones , glass bottles and firebombs at the defenders i saw one of the molotov bombs hit the opposite building and feared that the building was going to catch fire from a short distance each group continued to hurl stones at the other until the vigilantes started to chant loudly we are one hand we are one hand we are one hand this seemed to calm tempers , and then one of the vigilantes stepped forward and reached out to place a hand on the shoulder of one of the attackers suddenly , the tension dissipated and both groups dispersed peacefully huda lutfi , excerpt from war and peace on champollion street mark bittman oprah winfrey , who has been on more diets than the rest of us combined , challenged her staff to go vegan for a week intriguing , except her idea of surviving without meat and dairy no explanation given for why we should go from too much to none is to fill your shopping cart with fake versions of both , like meatless chicken breasts and dairyless cheese but the goal is not universal veganism , which is pieinthesky it s health and sustainability and we get there by preparing real food , vegan or not \( remember coke , tostitos and reese s peanut butter puffs yum ! are all vegan \) the answer is not fake animal products , whose advocates argue that they 're transitional to a kindertoanimal diet indeed , that s good , but a real food diet is better excerpt from is 'eat real food' unthinkable \? for more , nytimescom opinionator

the decisive fifth match is the davis cup s signature moment , and the common thread between the men who won those fifth matches sunday in the world group was that none of them had been through anything like it before not philipp petzschner , who put germany into the quarterfinals not j r my chardy , who did the same for france not mikhail kukushkin , who did it for the best russian team that kazakhstan could recruit if those three players do not spark recognition , there is a reason all three are in their mid20s and were ranked outside the top 50 last week before davis cup play resumed despite some success in the early stages of grand slam tournaments , none has won or threatened to win a significant title but one of the beauties of the davis cup , the sport s oftmaligned team event , is that it can propel supporting actors into lead roles in the course of a weekend so it went again and again in this opening round , which ended in a converted airport hangar near vienna , with chardy getting the better of his nerves and his lessexperienced opponent , the 139thranked martin fischer , to win in four sets and finish off france s 32 victory over austria by then , petzschner had secured germany s spot in the second round with a straightset but far from straightforward victory over ivo karlovic , the intimidating croatian who had slammed the fastest recorded serve in history 156 miles per hour in doubles on saturday i went through all kinds of emotional stages , chardy told french reporters thankfully there was guy he really helped me on the chair it was really a difficult match sometimes , i had the impression that forehands , backhands i was n't too much in control of what i was doing but today , the victory was what was important , not the manner of the victory guy would be guy forget , the longtime french davis cup captain who has been oftmaligned since his team was beaten by serbia in the final last year his lineup selections in that match were questioned and , leading to this tie , he was called out by a key player , gilles simon , in an interview simon maintained that he had asked forget not to talk to him about his game during matches because they had different visions of what constituted simon s best tennis but despite all the downbeat patter , this turned into a reaffirming round for forget , an animated courtside presence who managed to push just enough right buttons to get france into the quarterfinals despite the absence of its three top players the injured ga l monfils , jowilfried tsonga and richard gasquet the best move was calling up chardy , a former wimbledon junior champion who reached the fourth round at the in 2008 but had not won a match on tour since october and had never played a davis cup singles match that mattered until he upset the austrian no 1 , j rgen melzer , in straight sets friday it was not as if forget did not have more established options in singles , including micha l llodra but forget took his latest risk and was rewarded with attacking brilliance from chardy on friday and a second victory sunday after simon failed to hold a lead against melzer in the first reverse singles match and ended up being beaten , 60 , in the fifth the strength of french tennis is being able to count on a really large group of players , forget said a davis cup campaign is not won with four players but with six or seven depth is indeed helpful in this injuryriddled era , giving the fortunate captains options no matter what the surface there was a time when playing host to the spanish on a quick indoor court would have been enough to destabilize them but their players are allsurface terrors now , and the world no 1 , rafael nadal , back in action for the first time since injuring his leg at the australian open , felt eager enough against the belgians indoors in charleroi to agree to play singles sunday after spain had clinched victory the day before a dead rubber the evocative davis cup term for a meaningless match is not traditional no 1 territory , but nadal clearly wanted playing time before flying to the united states for the indian wells tournament that will begin this week and if all goes according to plan , he will fly back to the united states again after wimbledon for spain s quarterfinal match in july , quite possibly in andy roddick s home city , austin , tex neither nadal nor roddick played davis cup last year , but they have recommitted , and roddick was the one who had to dig the deepest in the opening round requiring four sets to get through both his singles matches in chile on his least favorite surface , clay , against men ranked far below him , nicolas massu and paul capdeville roddick is now 120 when he has had an opportunity to clinch a cup victory united states versus spain looks like the pick of the quarterfinals , with serbia s match in sweden also promising if novak djokovic returns to the serbian lineup and robin soderling remains in sweden s france will travel to germany , perhaps without chardy or simon , and kazakhstan will travel to argentina this is kazakhstan s first year at the davis cup s elite level , and it advanced by taking out tomas berdych and the czech republic on the road in ostrava with the kazakhs behind , 12 , heading into sunday , andrey golubev upset berdych with a barrage of winners , and kukushkin then defeated jan hajek in four sets in the fifth match kukushkin , like the other three members of his team , once represented russia but was recruited by kazakhstan , a central asian nation whose president , nursultan nazarbayev , has made tennis a priority kukushkin and his teammates switched nationalities , in part , because they were struggling to break into the russian davis cup lineup and attract sponsorship and support but the davis cup works in mysterious ways , and while kazakhstan is in the quarterfinals , russia without its leaders , nikolay davydenko and mikhail youzhny could not find a way past sweden
shortly after commissioner appointed tom schieffer to run the against the will of the team s ownership last month , schieffer held a meeting with the players in the clubhouse at dodger stadium schieffer , whose appointment was prompted by the dodgers' financial problems , told the players that although the team s owner , frank mccourt , did not want him involved in running the team , the players had nothing to worry about beyond hitting , fielding and pitching he told us to go about our business , that nothing has changed , said rod barajas , the dodgers' starting catcher he said there is nothing for us to worry about and to go out there and play baseball and everything will be taken care of and that this should not be a distraction for , the dodgers' firstyear manager , the notion of having to play through turmoil in the front office is probably as familiar as taking batting practice mattingly played his for the , from 1982 to 1995 , under the eventful ownership of  there was the time baseball suspended steinbrenner for hiring someone to spy on outfielder dave winfield there were the numerous episodes when steinbrenner fired managers or general managers and then there were the innumerable provocative statements , like steinbrenner s public demand that mattingly get a haircut mattingly said that experiences like those , and having to discuss them with members of the news media , had made it easier for him to shrug off the uncertainty swirling around the team anything that happens in life , you learn from those experiences , said mattingly , who returned to new york on friday for a threegame series with the mets i think playing here was good for me as far as this goes because there was a lot of stuff that went on , a lot of stuff that was talked about , but it always gets back to the field for me as a player , and i try to relate this to our players , there s only a little bit of this that we control , and that s what we do out here on the field the stuff that goes on about what people write , or what s going on above us with what the owner says , or anything that s said on talk radio , none of that really changes what we do so when schieffer told the players not to allow events to distract them from their jobs , he was echoing a theme that mattingly had been preaching since spring training the bitter divorce proceedings between mccourt and his wife , jaime , and the team s dire financial situation cannot be used as an excuse for poor play mattingly said that at the beginning of spring training , he told the players there would be obstacles during the season they could include inclement weather , injuries and latenight travel none of those are acceptable excuses so this is really just another one of those , he said you could sit here and answer questions , but it s still not an excuse come game time not to be ready to play , not to be in the right spots , all the things we have to do as a team to win games no matter what s going on above you , it does n't change anything at the same time , mattingly could be forgiven if he were looking for excuses his team is not playing as well as expected and came into friday s game with a 1517 record his closer , jonathan broxton , was placed on the disabled list with a bone bruise on his elbow and is expected to miss at least a month infielder juan uribe is playing with an injured right hand although the team s no 3 hitter , andre ethier , had a single in the first inning , extending his hitting streak to 30 games , he has been playing with a sore right elbow meanwhile , the team is being operated by major league baseball and could be sold anytime but mattingly said he was having fun i love what i'm doing , mattingly said it s not working out quite as good as i 've liked , two games under 500 but it does n't really change how much i enjoy it or love the challenge of it , that s for sure inside pitch angel pagan came to new york on friday to have a magnetic resonance imaging test on his sore oblique muscle pagan , the mets' center fielder at the start of the season , strained the muscle on april 21 , the first game when jason bay returned from the disabled list with a similar injury pagan had been playing in port st lucie for the class a st lucie mets and was said to be close to returning but he felt discomfort , and a return date is uncertain
giants \( 66 \) at cowboys \( 75 \) , 8 20 pm eastern sunday , nbc matchup to watch demarcus ware vs offensive line with 15 sacks in 12 games , ware is a threat to wreak havoc in any team s backfield , particularly when facing an offensive line like the giants' , which will be without two of its starters left tackle david diehl will see plenty of ware , a hulking outside linebacker , but he attacks from all sides and the giants must plan accordingly number to watch 1 , 076 that s how many receiving yards victor cruz has totaled this season , and he has recorded more than 100 in each of the past three games hakeem nicks is still the giants' no 1 receiver , but cruz has become a critical receiver for eli manning when it comes to quickstrike big plays quotation of the week i do n't wear wranglers , i do n't wear cowboy hats or boots or those buckle belts i do n't wear none of that giants defensive end justin tuck , in response to ware s comment that tuck probably wants to play in dallas because everybody wants to play for the cowboys this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo victor cruz has 100 yards receiving in each of his last three games \( photograph by barton silverman the new york times \) graphics
washington if you want to see the direction that education reform is taking the country , pay a visit to my leafy , majorityblack neighborhood in washington while we have lived in the same house since our 11yearold son was born , he s been assigned to three different elementary schools as one after the other has been shuttered now it s time for middle school , and there s been no neighborhood option available meanwhile , across rock creek park in a wealthy , majoritywhite community , there is a sparkling new neighborhood middle school , with rugby , fencing , an international baccalaureate curriculum and all the other amenities that make people pay top dollar to live there such inequities are the perverse result of a reform process intended to bring choice and accountability to the school system instead , it has destroyed communitybased education for workingclass families , even as it has funneled resources toward a few betteroff , exclusive , institutions my neighborhood s last freestanding middle school was closed in 2008 , part of a round of closures by then mayor adrian fenty and his schools chancellor , michelle rhee the pride and gusto with which they dismantled those institutions was shameful , but i do n't blame them the closures were the inevitable outcome of policies hatched years before in 1995 the republicanled congress , ignoring the objections of local leadership , put in motion one of the country s strongest reform policies for washington if a school was deemed failing , students could transfer schools , opt to attend a or receive a voucher to attend a private school the idea was to introduce competition good schools would survive bad ones would disappear it effectively created a second education system , which now enrolls nearly half the city s public school students the charters consistently perform worse than the traditional schools , yet they are rarely closed meanwhile , failing neighborhood schools , depleted of students , were shut down invariably , schools that served the poorest families got the ax partly because those were the schools where students struggled the most , and partly because the parents of those students had the least power competition produces winners and losers i get that indeed , the rhetoric of school choice can be seductive to angstfilled middleclass parents like myself we crunch the data and believe that , with enough elbow grease , we can make the system work for us naturally , i 've only considered highperforming schools for my children , some of them public , some charter , some parochial , all outside our neighborhood but i 've come to realize that this brand of school reform is a great deal only if you live in a wealthy neighborhood you buy a house , and access to a good school comes with it whether you choose to enroll there or not , the public investment in neighborhood schools only helps your property values for the rest of us , it s a cynical game there are n't enough slots in the best neighborhood and charter schools so even for those of us lucky ones with cars and schooldata spreadsheets , our options are mediocre at best in the meantime , the neighborhood schools are dying after ms rhee closed our first neighborhood school , the students were assigned to an elementary school connected to a homeless shelter then that closed , and i watched the children get shuffled again earlier this year , when we were searching for a middle school for my son 11 is a vulnerable age for anyone our public options were even grimmer i could have sent him to one of the newly consolidated kindergartentoeighthgrade campuses in my neighborhood , with low test scores and no algebra or foreign languages we could enter a lottery for a spot in another charter or outofboundary middle school , competing against families all over the city the system recently floated a plan for yet another round of closings , with a proposal for new magnet middle school programs in my neighborhood , none of which would open in time for my son these proposals , like much of reform in washington , are aimed at some speculative future demographic , while doing nothing for the children already here in the meantime , enrollment , and the best teachers , continue to go to the whitest , wealthiest communities the situation for washington s working and middleclass families may be bleak , but we are hardly alone despite the lack of proof that schoolchoice policies work , they are gaining popularity in communities nationwide like us , those places will face a stark decision do they want equitable investment in community education , or do they want to hand it over to private schools and charters \? let s stop pretending we can fairly do both as long as we do , some will keep winning , but many of us will lose
this video shows one man s fastmoving effort to generate propaganda in war shot during the longrunning battle for the libyan town of brega in the spring , it presents a doctor working with antiqaddafi forces in ajdabiya as he displayed items he had removed from the pockets of a freshly killed qaddafi soldier the doctor then used these items to try to convince two journalists that the soldier was a paid mercenary and that he had been carrying exploding bullets in battle neither of these claims were supportable as framed by the doctor the objects in question his evidence did not merely fail to support the doctor s claims they established his claims as false let s walk it backwards , to show how the presentation did not add up then we can talk about some of what it means the photograph below shows two small papers removed from the dead man s pants unraveling the doctor s second assertion that these documents showed the dead soldier to have been a mercenary was simple moments after the soldier died on the gurney , the doctor produced the papers , which contained text in arabic , and said they were pay vouchers for the man s mercenary services , and worth thousands of dinars the doctor moved quickly so did bryan denton , a photographer working for the new york times , who photographed the papers as the dead man s accuser waved them about the next night , when we enlarged the images on a laptop screen and translated the clearly visible text to english , the vouchers emerged as something else entirely they were slips for a few dollars of fuel , and nothing more nothing about them said , or even hinted , that the dead man was a mercenary that had been quite a performance , given the intensity of the doctor s insistence that he had the goods but even before bryan shot those photographs , there were grounds to doubt the veracity of this emergencyroom show that is because the exploding bullet claim , which the doctor made the moment bryan and i turned up , was immediately suspect why \? the foundation for this allegation was that the red stripe along the neck of the cartridge case where the bullet was seated indicated that the cartridge held an exploding round the doctor was explicit this little cartridge was an instrument of nefarious construction and could inflict devastating wounds this bullet , when it touches anybody , it explodes inside , he said , as he excitedly paced around the emergency room it s a very aggressive bullet when a doctor in a frontline trauma center starts discussing the unusual nature of battlefield wounds that he is seeing in patients , it can be grounds to take notice but here facts intruded , even in real time it was not only that journalists had seen many wounded libyan rebels , and none had wounds that seemed out of the ordinary for battlefield trauma and it was not only that the doctor did not show us anything to change this impression things were simpler than that the clue to the falsehood was within the falsehood itself the meaning of the red stripe what the doctor did not seem to know was that a red lacquer stripe is one of the more common superficial features of standard kalashnikov ball and tracer ammunition , or that cartridges bearing such markings have been produced in vast quantities in several nations for decades \( a ball round is a common military term for a solid , nonexpanding bullet with a fullmetal jacket a tracer round is similar and contains a small bit of pyrotechnic material at its base , which illuminates the round s trajectory in flight both types of smallarms ammunition are routinely used by military services worldwide both comply with international convention \) a check with munitions specialists would find that this lacquer serves as a sealant , to prevent moisture from seeping into the cartridge and degrading the propellant what did all of this mean in this case \? anyone paying attention to the details of the weapons in use across eastern libya s battlefields to this point stood to know that rounds bearing this stripe were beyond common by the time the corpse of this unfortunate qaddafi soldier had ended up as exhibit a in this hospital s propaganda theater , bryan and i had been examining rebel ammunition , too this rough inventory had suggested that more than half of the rebel kalashnikov rounds on the front lines bore a red lacquer stripe and were standard ball rounds \( kalashnikov tracer rounds might have been present in this war , but we saw this ammunition fired constantly in gunfights , as panicked fire and often as celebratory fire and all of it seemed to be ball \) in sum , nothing about that red lacquer stripe excited interest rather , it was a typical feature of the ordinary kalashnikov ammunition circulating in the war , and it was being used by both sides what was interesting here was the doctor s effort at spin soon other stories pulled us away from ajdabiya toward misurata , and beyond but we saved a few photographs of the supposed exploding bullet later , in a lull , this blog shared closeup images of its head stamp \( the markings at the base of the cartridge , beside the primer cap \) and of the lacquer stripe with several private organizations and experts , including the small arms survey , in geneva , which helped gather information for the munitions identification the reaction of jonathan ferguson , a curator at the royal armouries museum in leeds , england , captured the common feeling he called the cartridge run of the mill a typical ball round he also added context , noting that this doctor was hardly the first to make such a claim exploding bullet tales are run of the mill , too the old exploding bullet routine goes back to the early 16th century with chewed sandrolled and poisoned bullets , believe it or not , he wrote in an email mr ferguson also generously suggested that people unfamiliar with bullet wounds were often simply mistaken about what caused them then as now , he said , most reports were probably misunderstandings of terminal effects within normal limits another researcher who often assists this blog burrowed down further and identified the round as a standard romanian ball round it even bore a particular feature of a different form of specialized manufacture the absence of a numeric factory marking on the head stamp this fit the history romania offered such rounds for export to customers who wanted discretion what you think of the doctor s performance might depend on what you think of the war to use this freshly dead qaddafi soldier as a propaganda prop was at once ghoulish and cunning this blog will leave your reaction to you but there are lessons here the first is that this is what trying to cover the battlefield sometimes can feel like to cover war is often to wander a thicket of lies and opportunists are ever trying to confuse you further war is like any other form of politics many people out there do not speak to journalists , they try to speak through journalists the distinction is important one nongovernment worker who was similarly frustrated described how the antiqaddafi forces spokesmen in the transitional national council , libya s new de facto authority , often did not especially care about the truth during the conflict but they did seem to care about publicly sparring with moussa ibrahim , the qaddafi government s top spokesman , who they saw as a bitter rival in the contest for the daily public discussion about the war for much of this year , a public win for the antiqaddafi forces was in oneupping the regime propaganda with propaganda of their own , each false assertion standing to be reproduced in a hesaidshesaid wrapup that fed the daily cycles of news again and again the antiqaddafi forces made claims that later proved not just wrong , but baldly untrue think , for one line of these falsehoods , how many times opposition officials in benghazi , their capital , said that the oil city of brega had fallen , and that rebels had it under their control , when in fact the qaddafi soldiers there remained entrenched , and the rebels disorganized , poorly led and often prone to pellmell retreats were still feeling their way clumsily down the road the second lesson is that this type of presentation often does not work , and can backfire the doctor s emergencyroom performance might seem rational to advocates of war by any means it is certainly a wartime staple demonizing the enemy , framing his actions as outrageous or even illegal , casting him as a special menace these are familiar , if risky , lines of public reasoning , especially when they rely on false facts in almost every war , there are examples writ large or writ small in the short term , circulating falsehoods and exaggerating or concocting evidence might feel like a smart shortcut for those seeking support for their cause but in the long term , wartime statements that evaporate under scrutiny are corrosive , and can harm those who craft them in libya , they undermined the credibility of the transitional council and many of its supporters , like this doctor , who instead of reaping some benefit or marshaling sympathy for the antiqaddafi cause demonstrated that even doctors could not always be relied upon , and that the dead were mere tools anthony shadid contributed reporting
midjune , 2011 i find myself alone in a dark wooded park tucked between milliondollar houses south of stanford university , looking for a spot in the bushes to stash my bags until that morning i d been living in a cheap weeklyrate motel in palo alto before checkout , knowing i couldn t afford the 48 fee for another night , i laid out my stuff on the bed over the cigarette burns on threadbare sheets , i scrounged for quarters , dimes and nickels there was enough for an extra value meal at taco bell i divided everything else i had between three bags an olivedrab backpack my brother used in the army rangers , a black duffel i bought at goodwill and a satchel for my laptop this was my life i was two weeks shy of my 28th birthday , unemployed , broke , thousands of miles from my family , watching the weather forecast to see how uncomfortable sleeping outside would be that night whatever the prediction , i could handle it four and a half years in the army , including 16 months as an infantryman in eastern afghanistan , provided plenty of skills with no legal application in the civilian world it was , however , wonderful preparation for being homeless i was searching for a hole in the bushes to hide my bags they were heavy and awkward , cumbersome to lug around palo alto they clashed with the mishmash of designer bags embroidered with labels from silicon valley tech companies that the stanford kids carried walking with them , i stood out , the opening scene of the first rambo movie cycling through my mind sylvester stallone on the side of the road with a big , green duffel bag slung over his shoulder and blending in with every part of his faded green field jacket except the red , white and blue flag patch , attracts the attention of the sheriff who wants john rambo and all the bad mojo he carries from vietnam out of his town that movie ended badly for rambo , the sheriff and the town my life wasn t a movie and i wasn t john rambo , but the same possibilities for a bad ending loomed i d learned that fact the only way fools like me learn anything experience as infantry on the ground in afghanistan , we were introduced to the ugliness of violent , unpredictable death over the 16 months of our tour , we caused it and we endured it we grew well acquainted with it sometimes i think that we took it back , an invisible scythecarrying stowaway on board the airplane we took back to the states how else to explain my friend michael cloutier , whose spoton shooting probably saved my life when our observation post was attacked by taliban who outnumbered us three to one , dying of a drug overdose a year after we came back \? or the staff sergeant from my former battalion second battalion , 87th infantry regiment , third brigade , tenth mountain division who committed suicide by cop on fort drum later that year when military police were called to investigate a domestic disturbance \? i didn t know him that well and had already left fort drum for a cushy assignment as an assistant in a fourstar general s headquarters , but i wrote the eulogy my old company commander delivered at his funeral not too long after that , when my friends in my old unit were rotating back , i started to crack a bit that year the taliban killed two of my friends , staff sgt esau i delapenahernandez , 25 , and sgt carlie m lee iii , 23 the next year a helicopter crash killed my brother , chief warrant officer gary marc farwell as my last real duty in the army , i escorted his body home from germany , wearing a dress uniform and saluting his casket in atlanta and salt lake city as it was loaded and unloaded from the commercial airliner none of this was on my mind that night in palo alto i just wanted to stash my bags and get some sleep , if i could i had a plan i wrapped the bags in a space blanket to keep the books and clothes inside dry , then wrapped it in a camouflage , armyissue poncho liner to keep them concealed after i stashed them in the bushes and saved the location on the gps that also held grid coordinates for firebases and combat outposts i had manned in afghanistan , i set off with my satchel , bound for stanford and their 24hour library it was finals time and short of a tsa inspection at the library entrance , no one would know that under my laptop , ipad , chargers , batteries , pens , paperback books and notepads were my hobo essentials a ziploc with a small hygiene kit , deodorant , a pair of underwear and a change of socks wearing a polo shirt and a pair of khakis , i could blend in , hide out and hopefully get a little sleep in the oncefamiliar environment an american college campus that , like my country , now felt so foreign and hostile paul rieckhoff , a veteran of operation iraqi freedom and the founder and chairman of iraq afghanistan veterans of america testified that over 11 , 000 veterans between the ages of 18 and 30 were officially listed that is , somehow identified , confirmed and entered in the department of veteran s affairs database as homeless that s more than a standard army division it s also really tricky to measure exactly , since there are plenty , like me , you d never suspect were homeless veterans if you saw them around town the law , united states code title 42 , chapter 119 , subchapter 1 , essentially defines a homeless person as somebody with no stable bed or shelter if you live in a box under the bridge , this counts if you live in a state or churchfunded homeless shelter , this counts if you are an inpatient for some sort of medical or psychiatric condition , this counts also , if you re somewhere in between couch surfing , living in a series of cheap motels , staying with your parents for an extended period of time , that counts by the definition of the law , i ve been homeless for about 16 months to put that in perspective , i ve been out of the army for about 18 months i m still not sure how i got there before afghanistan , i was no saint but i generally kept out of trouble no trouble with the law beyond a handful of tickets for speeding and parking i was a healthy and an absurdly welleducated striver my r sum lists eagle scout , davis

unemployed , attending one semester of college while recuperating from a spinal injury and trying to write , my work experience is unbroken since i landed my first job at 15 soldier , sat gre tutor , defense contracting intern , plumbing guy at lowe s , waiter and lifeguard i try to gloss over the multiple arrests and hospitalizations after the war and highlight my hope to return to the college i dropped out of once my head gets screwed on a little straighter part of the reason i came to california was to heal and figure out why my life seemed determined to come unglued blaming it on the war , the things i d seen and done there , seems a copout and a clich , but maybe there s something to it jonathan shay , a psychiatrist with the veterans administration who earned a macarthur genius grant for his work on behalf of vets , wrote that combat posttraumatic stress disorder is a war injury veterans with combat ptsd are war wounded , carrying the burdens of sacrifice for the rest of us as

near facebook s new headquarters , had one of the best programs for treating guys like me , so i was waiting to get in that night in june , though , i was on my own i walked down to greene library , took a spot on a couch in the corner , unpacked my laptop and carefully set up my workspace i used the bathroom , washed my hands , rolled a cigarette and walked outside to bum a light from a stressedout student i inhaled , exhaled and saw the sky looking at the stars , i laughed and coughed , the honest part of me wishing i was still in afghanistan memories \( bad , good and indifferent

a man wanted in connection with a post office robbery four years ago fired two gunshots monday morning at deputy united states marshals who had tracked him down to a house in jamaica , queens , a spokesman for the united states marshals service said none of the officers were hurt , and they eventually talked the wanted man , derome gray , into surrendering , according to the spokesman , deputy marshal james elcik no additional shots were fired , he said prosecutors said that mr gray , 40 , and others robbed a post office on archer avenue in jamaica in june 2007 the robbers gained access to the safe after threatening the manager by pointing a gun at his head , but prosecutors said that the robbery yielded little according to a recent government court filing , the robbers failed to discover approximately 60 , 000 in the post office a postal employee , who prosecutors say supplied the intruders the key code to the back door , has pleaded guilty to related charges , court records indicate mr gray , who already faces charges of robbery and unlawful use of a firearm , is likely to face additional charges in connection with the encounter with marshals on monday , mr elcik said he is expected to appear in federal district court in brooklyn on monday afternoon on monday , the authorities recovered several firearms , including a submachine gun , at the scene of mr gray s arrest , on 144th terrace , a spokesman for the united states attorney s office , robert nardoza , said a second man was also taken into custody , the authorities said this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
i m still having fun with the atlanta fed s stickyprice cpi data these data go back to the late 1960s , and offer an interesting contrast between then and now for those just joining this conversation the idea of core inflation involves making a distinction between prices that fluctuate all the time , and those that are changed only at fairly long intervals , and are therefore set with future inflation in mind i explained how limited pricesetting can cause inflation inertia a while back the original version of this argument goes back to ned phelps , who explained more than 40 years ago \( pdf \) how staggered wage setting leads to a situation in which actual wage growth depends both on unemployment and on expected future wage growth the point here is that there s an important distinction between the prices of wheat , oil , rubber , etc that may rise or fall by doubledigit amounts over the course of a year , then quickly reverse that rise or fall , and the prices of many services and manufactured goods and most wages which are set for periods of months or years the latter are slow to develop inflation , but also slow to give it up , which is why policy should focus on whether those prices have started to rise too fast \( or too slowly \) the question , however , is whether changes in the flexibleprice goods feed into persistent inflation in the core phelps thought not he believed that wages were set mainly in reference to other wages , implying that swings in oil or wheat prices were largely irrelevant to the story i d agree if we think of wages as the ultimate core price , i don t see any mechanism in today s america whereby rising commodity prices translate into higher wage contracts but what does the historical record say \? it depends on which era you re looking at from the atlanta fed data the two big commodity price shocks of the 70s did , in fact , feed quickly into core inflation since then , however , nada why the difference \? the obvious point is that back in the 70s many labor contracts included cost of living adjustments \( colas \) this in turn partly reflected stronger worker bargaining positions and also real doubts about whether monetary policy would contain inflation today , none of that colas are rare , and commodityprice fluctuations don t feed into wages at all i know there s a school of thought that believes that the 1970s are coming back any day now but i haven t seen any sign of the return of bellbottom pants , actually good hollywood movies , or wageprice spirals
overview in this lesson , students play with words that can function either as nouns or verbs , depending on context they then find and parse double duty words in new york times articles advanced students compare these instances with information in dictionaries and frequency count lists , showing which usage occurs more frequently in english materials student notebooks , copies of times articles warmup on the board , list words that can function as both nouns and verbs without a spelling or pronunciation change , like milk and mail provide words for the class and elicit more from students you may wish to include slang terms like stan a term for super fan which , the times reported , can be used as both a noun \( omg , i am the biggest rihanna stan \) or as a verb \( mexico is stanning so hard for britney spears right now \) when you have a list of 30 words or more , tell each student to choose two words from the list and write two sentences in their notebooks one in which both words are used as nouns \( the milk and the mail were on the kitchen table \) and another in which both are used as verbs \( i mailed the letter for the new farmer who milks his cows in the field next to my house \) whip around and have everyone share sentences aloud what did the class notice \? what did the sentences bring to mind \? were there any words that gave students some trouble when it came to creating sentences in one of the parts of speech \? are any of the words used more frequently as a noun than as a verb \? or as a verb than a noun \? related the weekly after deadline posts focus on critiques of grammar , usage and style in the times a september 2009 post called to google , or not \? looked at the use of registered trademarks as verbs the argot of the technosavvy is filled these days with trademarked names doing the work of verbs , with google , twitter and tweet the most obvious examples even aside from the trademark issue , we should generally avoid using those terms as verbs \( or as common nouns \) in straightnews contexts when they first arise , such words have the flavor of insider jargon even after they catch on widely as with the verb to google they have a colloquial tone that is out of place in straight news the alternatives don t have to be awkward or clunky simple options might include check google or do a google search  use twitter or post a twitter update  read the entire post with your class , using the questions below questions for discussion and reading comprehension activity here are two games students can play using the times to learn more about words that do double duty as both nouns and verbs word hunt game give students copies of a times article and ask them to find doubleduty words and identify their function in each sentence do this activity as a game or competition how many nouns can they find in three minutes \? how many verbs \? take , for example , the article customers angry over revamped pricing are deserting netflix the first paragraph includes the words lies , serve , shows , thinking and part can students identify the parts of speech for these words \? other doubleduty words in this article are stream , opt , decline , drop out , benefit , splitting , note , remains , experiences , shop , supplies and films for full credit or an extra point , have students prove the word they identified is a doubleduty word not only by accurately identifying the times s usage but also by coming up with a sentence using the word in the other part of speech to expand the activity , include other parts of speech so that students identify words that work double duty in more than the nounverb pairing , or even words with triple duty in the netflix article headline , for example , the word revamped is used as an adjective it can also be a verb splitting is used as a noun here \( the splitting of the services \) it can also be an adjective \( a splitting headache \) or a verb \( netflix is splitting the services \) to expand even further , you could change the rules to accept doubleduty words that have a change of pronunciation english has about two dozen words , like object , in which a shift in stress from the first to second syllable causes the word to switch from noun to verb can students think of other words \? how about phrases , like white wash and whitewash \? language bingo fill in a blank bingo board with grammatical constructions like subject in the singular , helping verb , sentence in which a verb is the first word , plural subject and past tense verb give each student a copy of the board along with a page or section of the new york times , and play language bingo  for more advanced students , the bingo board might include constructions like modal helping verb , none used as plural and subject is collective noun going further students analyze headlines for construction , meaning and ambiguity choose a page or section and make a list of all the verbs in the headlines from those stories what is the most common type of verb \? compare that section with another what kinds of verbs are used \? what differences do students see in the use of verbs and nouns in headlines for sections like news , sports and opinion \? to go further , give each student an issue of the daily paper or access to nytimescom along with a list of things to look for in headlines beginning students might do the following more advanced students might receive prompts like these standards this lesson is correlated to mcrel s national standards \( it can also be aligned to the new common core state standards \) language arts 1 uses the general skills and strategies of the writing process 2 uses the stylistic and rhetorical aspects of writing 3 uses grammatical and mechanical conventions in written compositions 5 uses the general skills and strategies of the reading process 7 uses skills and strategies to read a variety of informational texts
rio de janeiro not long ago a city bus drove me by rocinha , a sprawling favela of 100 , 000 people in southern rio with a global reputation for violence from the safety of my seat i watched the chaos beauty parlors were packed young people on motorcycles crisscrossed the paths at shocking speeds a group of school girls giggled as they took pictures with their phones of flirtatious boys strutting by funk and samba music blared out of the bars i loved the scene , but i wasn t about to get off the bus for a walk favelas are everywhere in a city of six million , more than one million people reside in more than 1 , 000 slums spread out across town but most middleclass brazilians like me do their best to avoid them they are the sort of places that princess diana and the pope visit to show compassion for the poor the rampant crime deters the rest of us the past 20 years have been particularly dreadful for favela residents a steep rise in drug trafficking and arms smuggling has fed a brutal gang culture the gang bosses tend to be teenagers and young adults who display their rifles , revolvers and grenades with pride they have the cash to buy fancy shoes and shiny jewelry they die young three years ago , in preparation for hosting the world cup and olympic games , the rio authorities got their act together rather than merely patrol the favelas , which had done little good over the decades , the police started occupying them , military style the occupations begin with a raid first , the police swoop in by helicopter and personnel carriers then they go doortodoor chasing gang leaders sometimes gunfights ensue eventually , the police set up stations at the heart of the favelas , and disarm the locals street by street in theory at least , as they establish control , they pave the way for government services and public utilities last month the police occupied rocinha they had announced the impending raid in hopes of avoiding a bloodbath the approach worked , with 47 arrests so far but no deaths or even gunfights what the police confiscated in the first week of the occupation illustrates the power of the gangs 185 illegal weapons , 199 explosives , 166 kilograms of cocaine , 138 kilograms of marijuana , 232 stolen motorcycles and 22 stolen cars rio s authorities are feeling confident now having occupied 19 favelas thus far , they plan to occupy a total of 40 by 2015 the new policy has many fans favela occupations , supporters say , are a prerequisite for taking care of the poor , who for too long have been ignored by the politicians \( illiterate brazilians only got the vote in 1985 \) occupations are a step toward giving favela dwellers a chance to live better , with basic things like access to paved streets and lighting they are a prelude to a more peaceful and prosperous town but the occupations have many detractors some residents worry that corrupt police officers will take over the drug trade there have been stories detailing police abuse including reports of militias made up of firemen and retired and offduty police officers that shake down favela residents meanwhile , some residents are unhappy that they will now have to pay higher bills for electricity and internet connections and many are appalled that the police have restricted , or altogether banned , the funkmusic parties that draw hordes on weekend nights the occupations might end up fueling new kinds of violence there is no way to know if they will work but we do know that the strategy offers a new sense of possibility where once there was none
midjune , 2011 i find myself alone in a dark wooded park tucked between milliondollar houses south of stanford university , looking for a spot in the bushes to stash my bags until that morning i d been living in a cheap weeklyrate motel in palo alto before checkout , knowing i couldn t afford the 48 fee for another night , i laid out my stuff on the bed over the cigarette burns on threadbare sheets , i scrounged for quarters , dimes and nickels there was enough for an extra value meal at taco bell i divided everything else i had between three bags an olivedrab backpack my brother used in the army rangers , a black duffel i bought at goodwill and a satchel for my laptop this was my life i was two weeks shy of my 28th birthday , unemployed , broke , thousands of miles from my family , watching the weather forecast to see how uncomfortable sleeping outside would be that night whatever the prediction , i could handle it four and a half years in the army , including 16 months as an infantryman in eastern afghanistan , provided plenty of skills with no legal application in the civilian world it was , however , wonderful preparation for being homeless i was searching for a hole in the bushes to hide my bags they were heavy and awkward , cumbersome to lug around palo alto they clashed with the mishmash of designer bags embroidered with labels from silicon valley tech companies that the stanford kids carried walking with them , i stood out , the opening scene of the first rambo movie cycling through my mind sylvester stallone on the side of the road with a big , green duffel bag slung over his shoulder and blending in with every part of his faded green field jacket except the red , white and blue flag patch , attracts the attention of the sheriff who wants john rambo and all the bad mojo he carries from vietnam out of his town that movie ended badly for rambo , the sheriff and the town my life wasn t a movie and i wasn t john rambo , but the same possibilities for a bad ending loomed i d learned that fact the only way fools like me learn anything experience as infantry on the ground in afghanistan , we were introduced to the ugliness of violent , unpredictable death over the 16 months of our tour , we caused it and we endured it we grew well acquainted with it sometimes i think that we took it back , an invisible scythecarrying stowaway on board the airplane we took back to the states how else to explain my friend michael cloutier , whose spoton shooting probably saved my life when our observation post was attacked by taliban who outnumbered us three to one , dying of a drug overdose a year after we came back \? or the staff sergeant from my former battalion second battalion , 87th infantry regiment , third brigade , tenth mountain division who committed suicide by cop on fort drum later that year when military police were called to investigate a domestic disturbance \? i didn t know him that well and had already left fort drum for a cushy assignment as an assistant in a fourstar general s headquarters , but i wrote the eulogy my old company commander delivered at his funeral not too long after that , when my friends in my old unit were rotating back , i started to crack a bit that year the taliban killed two of my friends , staff sgt esau i delapenahernandez , 25 , and sgt carlie m lee iii , 23 the next year a helicopter crash killed my brother , chief warrant officer gary marc farwell as my last real duty in the army , i escorted his body home from germany , wearing a dress uniform and saluting his casket in atlanta and salt lake city as it was loaded and unloaded from the commercial airliner none of this was on my mind that night in palo alto i just wanted to stash my bags and get some sleep , if i could i had a plan i wrapped the bags in a space blanket to keep the books and clothes inside dry , then wrapped it in a camouflage , armyissue poncho liner to keep them concealed after i stashed them in the bushes and saved the location on the gps that also held grid coordinates for firebases and combat outposts i had manned in afghanistan , i set off with my satchel , bound for stanford and their 24hour library it was finals time and short of a tsa inspection at the library entrance , no one would know that under my laptop , ipad , chargers , batteries , pens , paperback books and notepads were my hobo essentials a ziploc with a small hygiene kit , deodorant , a pair of underwear and a change of socks wearing a polo shirt and a pair of khakis , i could blend in , hide out and hopefully get a little sleep in the oncefamiliar environment an american college campus that , like my country , now felt so foreign and hostile paul rieckhoff , a veteran of operation iraqi freedom and the founder and chairman of iraq afghanistan veterans of america testified that over 11 , 000 veterans between the ages of 18 and 30 were officially listed that is , somehow identified , confirmed and entered in the department of veteran s affairs database as homeless that s more than a standard army division it s also really tricky to measure exactly , since there are plenty , like me , you d never suspect were homeless veterans if you saw them around town the law , united states code title 42 , chapter 119 , subchapter 1 , essentially defines a homeless person as somebody with no stable bed or shelter if you live in a box under the bridge , this counts if you live in a state or churchfunded homeless shelter , this counts if you are an inpatient for some sort of medical or psychiatric condition , this counts also , if you re somewhere in between couch surfing , living in a series of cheap motels , staying with your parents for an extended period of time , that counts by the definition of the law , i ve been homeless for about 16 months to put that in perspective , i ve been out of the army for about 18 months i m still not sure how i got there before afghanistan , i was no saint but i generally kept out of trouble no trouble with the law beyond a handful of tickets for speeding and parking i was a healthy and an absurdly welleducated striver my r sum lists eagle scout , davis scholar , echols scholar and national merit finalist alongside the combat infantryman s badge , army commendation medals and parachutist wings with the exception of the last year , which i have spent unemployed , attending one semester of college while recuperating from a spinal injury and trying to write , my work experience is unbroken since i landed my first job at 15 soldier , sat gre tutor , defense contracting intern , plumbing guy at lowe s , waiter and lifeguard i try to gloss over the multiple arrests and hospitalizations after the war and highlight my hope to return to the college i dropped out of once my head gets screwed on a little straighter part of the reason i came to california was to heal and figure out why my life seemed determined to come unglued blaming it on the war , the things i d seen and done there , seems a copout and a clich , but maybe there s something to it jonathan shay , a psychiatrist with the veterans administration who earned a macarthur genius grant for his work on behalf of vets , wrote that combat posttraumatic stress disorder is a war injury veterans with combat ptsd are war wounded , carrying the burdens of sacrifice for the rest of us as surely as the amputees , the burned , the blind and the paralyzed carry them , he wrote the palo alto va was one of the best in the country , i d heard , and their psychiatric division in menlo park , near facebook s new headquarters , had one of the best programs for treating guys like me , so i was waiting to get in that night in june , though , i was on my own i walked down to greene library , took a spot on a couch in the corner , unpacked my laptop and carefully set up my workspace i used the bathroom , washed my hands , rolled a cigarette and walked outside to bum a light from a stressedout student i inhaled , exhaled and saw the sky looking at the stars , i laughed and coughed , the honest part of me wishing i was still in afghanistan memories \( bad , good and indifferent \) of four and a half years wearing the uniform , a third of that in combat , occupy psychic space next to deeply ingrained habits , skills and instinctive reactions that , like all things warrelated , are doubleedged back home they helped keep me alive and sane amid the boredom , ennui , confused terror and brief moments of adrenalinefueled elation of combat a euphoric sense of zenlike calm and focus that s better than any drug i ve ever tried or heard about but they ve been doing their damnedest to kill me and my friends since we got back matt farwell was a soldier in the united states army from 2005 to 2010 after infantry and airborne training at fort benning , ga , he was assigned to the tenth mountain division s second battalion , 87th infantry regiment and deployed to afghanistan for

bertel bruun , a coauthor and designer of a hugely successful guidebook that helped make birdwatching easier for millions of binoculartoting neophytes , died on sept 21 at his home in remsenburg , on long island he was 73 the cause was heart failure , his son erik said dr bruun , a neurologist and an amateur ornithologist , wrote or helped write more than a dozen books , but none has been more popular than birds of north america , part of the golden field guides series first published in 1966 , it became an instant hit with birders \( a term they prefer to birdwatchers \) , and more than four million copies have been sold the guidebook built on the work of the renowned ornithologist , whose field guide to the birds \( 1934 \) popularized what had been an esoteric interest with a blend of science and evocative prose birds of north america , written by dr bruun with chandler robbins and herbert zim and illustrated by arthur singer , was a more terse and accessible handbook for those trying to discern whether it was a or an that had just fluttered away what is compelling about it is its utilitarian simplicity , said pete dunne of new jersey audubon , an organization independent of the national audubon society though dr bruun wrote some of the text , perhaps his biggest contribution was designing a layout that served that simplicity whatever the reader needs to know about a genus or a species is presented across two pages on the righthand page are vivid illustrations on the left , the information distinguishing characteristics , behaviors , habitat , a map showing the seasonbyseason range across the continent \( a distinguishing characteristic of the eastern wood pewee song is a plaintive , whistled peeoowee , peeoo \) dr bruun s layout , though no longer considered unusual , was a breakthrough in peterson s guides , the illustrations \( with brief summations \) were on one page while the full texts were elsewhere in the book in a way , even though he contributed the least amount of content , bruun s contribution was the most important , said kenn kaufman , a field editor for audubon magazine the design was just so convenient for field use that it became hugely popular right away and affected the design of almost all subsequent field guides birds and other subjects mr dunne recalled how one day as a youngster he was roaming the woods near his home in northern new jersey when he caught a onesecond glimpse of a goldenwinged warbler as it hopped from one branch to another , and i recognized it i would n't have done that without this book born in skaelskor , denmark , on nov 13 , 1937 , bertel bruun was the son of erik and ebba poulsen bruun after earning his bachelor s and medical degrees at the university of copenhagen , he moved in the mid1960s to new york , where he specialized in neurology besides his son erik , dr bruun is survived by his wife of 41 years , the former ruth dowling two other sons , peter and christian two stepsons , timothy and thomas newman a stepdaughter , isabel blackburn and 15 grandchildren his first marriage , to the former barbara leventhal , ended in divorce after a stroke left him unable to practice medicine , dr bruun moved to long island in 1989 and , in addition to wandering the woods in search of birds , engaged in another childhood fascination he started march of time , a company that traded in antique toy soldiers more than 5 , 000 of which lined his shelves , many posed in battle formations in 1994 he wrote toy soldiers identification and price guide
notre dame s basketball team has been a great story this season unranked to start the year in fact , notre dame didn t receive a single vote in the associated press preseason poll they ve compiled a 144 record in the deep big east conference and a 255 record overall now ranked fourth in the country in the ap poll , they could secure a no 1 seed in the ncaa tournament with a strong performance during the big east tournament at madison square garden the notre dame team is experienced their lineup often consists of five seniors but not deep or particularly athletic \( they rank just 162nd in the country , for instance , in shotblocking , which is a decent indicator of raw physical talent \) their best player , ben hansbrough , will probably not be drafted until the 2nd round of the nba draft if he is selected at all instead , they re a smartlycoached , overachieving team that has had a knack for winning close games history would suggest , however , that when teams with this profile enter the tournament , the tables are sometimes turned instead of exceeding expectations , they often become the victims of upsets since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985 , there have been 41 cases in which a school that was unranked to start the season entered the tournament ranked in the ap top 10 \( excluding a couple of cases where the team was ineligible for tournament play \) these schools , as you might expect , were seeded highly eight were no 1 seeds and another 17 were seeded no 2 absolutely none of these teams have made the final four , however they are 0for41 instead , they have been the victims of some notorious upsets , like the no 2seeded south carolina gamecocks losing by 13 points ! to the no 15 seed coppin state in the opening round of the 1997 tournament , and the no 3 seed wisconsin badgers being one of davidson s victims in 2008 three of the no 1 seeds that fit this description michigan in 1985 , st john s in 1986 , and cincinnati in 2002 lost in the round of 32 we can take a more comprehensive view of this by comparing the number of games that these teams were expected to win based on their seed for instance , since 1985 , no 2 seeds have won an average of 24 tournament games to the number that they actually won collectively , these 41 teams ought to have won about 95 games based on their seeding instead , they won just 70 in contrast to polls conducted during the regular season , which aspire to rank teams on the merits , the preseason poll is essentially a prediction of how the teams are likely to perform the writers who vote in the poll presumably consider things like coaching , the quality of talent on the roster , and how the team has performed in recent seasons although we all like to make fun of sportswriters , these predictions are actually pretty decent since 2003 , the team ranked higher in the ap preseason poll \( excluding cases where neither team received at least 5 votes \) has won 72 percent of tournament games that s exactly the same number , 72 percent , as the fraction of games won by the better seed and it s a little better than the 71 percent won by teams with the superior ratings percentage index , the statistical formula that the seeding committee prefers \( more sophisticated statistical ratings , like ken pomeroy s , do only a little better , with a 73 percent success rate \) what s going on here \? it s almost certainly a case of reversion to the mean consider what would happen if a team ranked no 2 to start the year duke , say lost its first game to an average team quite rightly , your opinion of duke would go down but you probably wouldn t conclude that , for instance , they were only the 200th best team in the country instead , you d figure that they probably had been a bit overrated to begin with but also had been a bit unlucky to lose the game maybe you d think they deserved to be ranked something like no 20 instead still a good team , but perhaps not a great one as more and more games are played , you d place more and more weight on their actual performance and less on your initial expectations nobody would claim that duke would deserve to be ranked if they started out the year 14 even though the college basketball season is fairly long , however , it turns out to be a mistake to entirely dismiss preseason expectations , even late in the year instead i ve studied this issue in preparation for the ncaa tournament projections that we re going to release next week the optimal blend for predictive purposes turns out to be something like five parts inseason performance to one part preseason expectations obviously , this implies that inseason performance such as measured by computer power ratings ought to be weighted much more heavily but preseason expectations do deserve some consideration , and accounting for them might allow you to win an extra game or two in your tournament pool teams that have vastly overachieved expectations , like notre dame or san diego state this year , are decent picks to be upset you may be wondering if the opposite also holds do teams that underachieve expectations during the regular season tend to overperform their seeds in the tournament \? here , the evidence is more mixed we identified 33 teams that began the year ranked in the ap top 10 , but that had dropped out of the top 25 entirely by the time the tournament was played \( but who nevertheless qualified for the field \) of these 33 teams , 19 lost in the opening round \( bad , but not quite as bad as it sounds since most were fairly low seeds \) but there are also some notable successes kansas , which underachieved during the regular season , won the tournament as a no 6 seed in 1988 north carolina reached the final four as a no 8 seed in 2000 four of these teams reached the elite eight , including missouri in 2002 as a no 12 seed obviously , these teams are hitandmiss some really have been unlucky , or have had to contend with injury issues that are resolved by the time the tournament began others , despite the lofty expectations , were really pretty lousy overall , however , they won 33 games when 28 were expected based on their seeds , so they overperformed slightly this year s set of underachieving schools like gonzaga , butler , kansas state and particularly michigan state need to be taken on a casebycase basis , but they are plausible picks to pull off a surprise or two none of this , by the way , should imply that a team like notre dame is not deserving of a no 1 seed \( especially if they win the big east tournament \) the seeding committee s goal , in my view , should be to seed the teams based on their performance , and not to predict how will they will do i also don t like the committee s practice of sometimes docking a team because of a lateseason injury , like it did to cincinnati in 2000 after kenyon martin was hurt , which surely affected how they performed in the tournament cincinnati , as a no 2 seed , lost its second game to tulsa but did not take away from what they had accomplished beforehand nevertheless , as they say in the mutual fund brochures , past performance is no guarantee of future results and if notre dame is a no 1 seed , whichever no 2 seed they are paired with will have to feel pretty good about its draw

washington as the fight over health care returned to the house floor on tuesday , the debate could largely be stripped down to four questions that are relatively simple to ask , if not to answer will the health care law , approved last year by democrats with no republican support , increase or reduce future federal deficits \? will the law lead to the elimination of jobs by overburdened employers as republicans assert , or will it create jobs as democrats maintain \? will the law raise or lower the cost of medical care for individuals and families , employers , and state and federal governments \? and , will the law achieve president obama s goal of providing coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans \? given the complexity of the issues , none of these questions can yet be answered definitively more certain is the fate of the republicans' bill to repeal the law , which contains 24 lines of legislative text and 38 lines of the names of the lawmakers sponsoring it while house republicans will vote to approve it on wednesday , the democratcontrolled senate is highly unlikely to act on it still , the assertions from the two sides highlight their radically different views about the proper role of government and market forces in the health care system it is a policy fight that is likely to rage for the next two years in congress and to figure prominently in the 2012 presidential campaign as floor debate on the repeal measure opened on tuesday , representative paul ryan , republican of wisconsin and chairman of the budget committee , who is a respected voice on fiscal issues , declared that the health care law would accelerate our country s path toward bankruptcy mr ryan expressed one of the republicans' main complaints that democrats and independent congressional budget analysts have underestimated the costs of the law , which republicans say will ultimately add hundreds of billions of dollars to future federal deficits the nonpartisan disagrees in its official analysis , the budget office estimated that the cost of new benefits in the health care law would be more than offset by revenues from new taxes and by cuts in projected spending , reducing future deficits repealing the law , the budget office has predicted , would add 230 billion to federal deficits from 2012 to 2021 republicans dispute that , saying the cost will be far higher than expected we believe that it is an unsustainable , openended entitlement that could very well bankrupt this country and the states , the house majority leader , representative eric cantor , republican of virginia , said at a news conference on tuesday the budget office has said that its estimates are based on the most likely outcomes , and that the eventual cost of the bill is equally likely to be higher or lower the office has also said that lawmakers may find it difficult to follow through with some aspects of the law , particularly cuts in projected medicare spending if the cuts do not take hold , the cost of the law could soar democrats , meanwhile , say the law could save even more money than expected because the budget office does not give them credit for likely improvements in the delivery of medical services that could slow the growth in costs for individuals , businesses and the federal and state governments weighing into the debate , mr obama said tuesday that americans were already enjoying many benefits of the new law , and that he would not let republicans dismantle it i'm willing and eager to work with both democrats and republicans to improve the affordable care act , mr obama said in a statement but we ca n't go backward the white house and congressional democrats said the law would create more than 300 , 000 jobs , by slowing the growth of health costs so employers would have more to spend on wages and hiring in addition , they said , the law provides tax credits to help many small businesses buy insurance for their employees by contrast , representative sam graves , republican of missouri and chairman of the house committee on small business , said the law could cost our economy 16 million jobs , one million of which could come from small businesses many economists say the effects on jobs are likely to be modest most large companies already provide health benefits to employees and many small businesses will be exempt from penalties if they fail to do so while employers often pay premiums for their employees , economists say , the cost of health benefits is , over time , generally passed on to workers , through reductions in wages or other compensation but employers cannot reduce the wages of people earning the minimum wage thus , the congressional budget office says , the new law will probably cause some employers to respond by hiring fewer lowwage workers , or by using more parttime and seasonal workers but democrats say that if the law provides coverage to more than 30 million currently uninsured people , as intended , it will increase demand for medical services , thus creating new job opportunities in the health care industry representative debbie wasserman schultz , democrat of florida , said , there is not a single area of health care that will experience job losses as a result of the law republicans have emphasized the jobs issue , even naming their bill the repealing the jobkilling health care law act but they have also pressed an argument that the law does not do much to slow the growth of health spending the law includes many provisions intended to restrain medical costs , which have long grown faster than general inflation for example , it would trim medicare payment rates for hospitals and many other health care providers create an independent advisory board to recommend further savings in medicare and encourage doctors and hospitals to coordinate care , eliminate duplicative tests and reduce the readmission of patients to hospitals but experts say they are not sure how effective these provisions will be , and note that countries around the globe have struggled to control medical costs republicans say the law is geared less to limiting costs than to extending coverage to the uninsured the budget office has estimated that by 2019 the law will have reduced the number of uninsured americans by 32 million but even with a provision in the law requiring that most americans obtain insurance , it is possible that the law will not cover as many people as expected some supporters of the law have questioned whether federal subsidies will be adequate to make insurance affordable for lower and middleincome americans and while the law includes a broad expansion of eligibility , many people now eligible do not enroll in addition , the continuing political controversy around the law has created even more uncertainty about how people will respond to it
manchester , nh if newt gingrich is the republican nominee and president obama accepts his famous challenge to seven threehour lincolndouglasstyle debates , viewers might find them only on cspan and should plan to have plenty of black coffee on hand at least that was one take away from a twoman , unmoderated debate of a mere 90 minutes between mr gingrich and jon m huntsman jr , who at one point , when asked if he had more to add , said , i see my daughter nodding off , so let s move on devoted to foreign policy and national security , the debate on monday was set to include 10 topics in true graduateseminar style , the candidates covered only half the ground it was an unusual hiatus from the republican nominating race that has reached a phase of high drama with much at stake for the fractured field but none of that urgency or competition seeped into the auditorium at st anselm s college , where mr gingrich and mr huntsman were unfailingly collegial , seeming to agree on almost all points mr huntsman , the former utah governor who is so far behind the rest of the field in national polls that he was excluded from an abc debate on saturday in iowa , missed a chance to sharply define himself thanks to the high profile foil of mr gingrich , who drew a large news media contingent mr huntsman even seemed to make a joke at his own expense if the good speaker becomes the nominee , he 'll have to overcome our very formidable operation on the ground here in new hampshire , he said both men displayed wide knowledge of world events speaking on china , where he recently was american ambassador , mr huntsman spoke in mandarin while citing what officials used to tell him , then translated it as , in china , we have politics too they used to say that to me too , mr gingrich said i never knew what it meant both candidates agreed that terrorism was a longterm threat mr gingrich compared it to the decadeslong cold war mr huntsman said , as far as the eye can see in the 21st century we have a terror problem the subject that generated the most intense discussion was a nuclear iran all options need to be on the table and mullahs need to know , mr huntsman said mr gingrich the idea you 'll wage a bombing campaign to take out all of iran s nuclear program is a fantasy you have to say to the iranians you dismantle your program or we start to takes steps that will stop you , mr gingrich said serious economic steps , serious political and psychological and diplomatic steps he suggested a gasoline embargo because the country , despite oil reserves , has only one refinery and imports 40 percent of its gasoline there was discussion of israel , but mr gingrich did not repeat recent controversial remarks about the legitimacy of the palestinian cause other topics covered included debt and defense spending , the arab spring and pakistan after an hour and a half , when the moderator offered the candidates a chance to hit the remaining five topics in a lightning round and they declined , the audience seemed to collectively sigh with relief but both candidates pronounced themselves pleased with the format this is what we should have a lot more of , mr gingrich said , because this is very substantive mr huntsman got in the subtlest of jabs by referring to a yearend debate that donald trump plans to moderate mr gingrich has agreed to attend , but mr huntsman has turned it down , saying recently that he would not kiss the ring of mr trump i ca n't wait to compare and contrast this format with the donald trump debate with the speaker , he said this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo \( photograph by joseph sywenkyj for the new york times \)
speakers rep michele bachmann , rminn rep ron paul , rtexas gov rick perry , rtexas former sen rick santorum , rpa former rep newt gingrich , rga former gov mitt romney , rmass former gov jon huntsman jr , rutah herman cain charlie rose , pbs anchor karen tumulty , washington post political correspondent juliana goldman , bloomberg tv white house correspondent announcer live from spaulding auditorium on the campus of dartmouth college , the bloombergwashington post republican presidential debate charlie rose i'm charlie rose welcome to dartmouth college in hanover , new hampshire , this great college established in 1769 in a state that often plays a crucial role in picking presidents tonight , it is the site of an important republican presidential debate brought to you by bloomberg , the washington post , and wbin television this is a time of anxiety about our country and our children s future in a continuing economic crisis many are in despair , not only about policy , but politics and so we ask who has the character , who has the ideas , and who has the experience to lead this debate is different and distinctive it is only about the economy so we debate this evening about spending and taxes , deficit and debt , about the present and the future , about rich and poor , and about the role of government and because we 're at a table this is the kind of table i like the kind of kitchen table where families for generations have come together to talk and solve their problems the rules are one minute for an answer , 30 seconds for followup and rebuttal if a candidate is singled out by name for criticism , they have 30 seconds to respond later in the debate , they will question each other i'm the moderator joining me are karen tumulty of the washington post and julianna goldman of bloomberg news joining us at the table , the eight republican candidates they are former governor of utah jon huntsman minnesota congresswoman michele bachmann texas governor rick perry former godfather s pizza ceo herman cain former us senator from pennsylvania rick santorum former speaker of the house of representatives newt gingrich texas congressman ron paul former massachusetts governor mitt romney i am pleased to be here at this table to have an opportunity to talk to them about the issues that all of us are thinking aboutand i begin this evening first with herman cain as you know , when standard poor s downgraded american credit , they noted not only the economic difficulties , but the political dysfunction so we begin this evening with the question what would you do specifically to end the paralysis in washington \? as you know , when standard poor s downgraded american credit , they noted not only the economic difficulties but the political dysfunction so we begin this evening with the question what would you do specifically to end the paralysis in washington \? herman cain two things present a bold plan to grow this economy , which i have put my 999 plan on the table , and it starts with throwing out the current tax code and putting in the 999 plan secondly , get serious about bringing down the national debt the only way we 're going to do that is the first year that i'm president and i oversee a fiscal year budget , make sure that revenues equals spending if we stop adding to the national debt , we can bring it down so the answer is , we must grow this economy with a bold solution , which is why i 've proposed 999 and at same time get serious about not creating annual deficits , so we can bring the national debt that will reestablish confidence in our system , and i believe we could get our credit rating back mr rose governor perry , are you prepared , even though you have said you want to make washington inconsequential , to go to washington and , as ronald reagan did , compromise on spending cuts and taxes in order to produce results \? governor rick perry \( rtx \) well , certainly , as the governor of the secondlargest state , i 've had to deal with folks on both sides of the aisle i 've signed six balanced budgets as the governor of of texas so working with folks on both sides of the aisle and and bringing ideas , whether it s ways to redo your tax structure or what have you one of the things that i laid out today i think is a pretty bold plan to put 12 million americans working in the energy industry and you do n't need congress to do that you need a president with a plan , which i'm laying out over the next three days , and clearly the intent to open up this treasure trove that america s sitting on and getting america independent on the domestic energy side it s time for another american declaration of independence it s time for energy independence mr rose we 'll come back to energy and also your economic plan this evening , but i go now to governor romney the paralysis is there and everybody s concerned about it what specifically would you be prepared to do to make the country moving again on addressing its problems \? mitt romney i 'd be prepared to be a leader you ca n't get the country to go in the right direction and get washington to work if you do n't have a president that s a leader and and three years ago we selected a person who 'd never had any leadership experience , never worked in the private sector , never had the opportunity to actually bring people together , and he has n't been able to do so he said he 'd bring us hope and change instead he s divided the nation and tried to blame other people the real course for america is to have someone who s a leader , who can identify people in both parties who care more about the country than they care about getting reelected there are democrats like that there are republicans like that i was the governor of a state that had a few democrats \( laughs \) people in this room know how many we had in massachusetts mr rose so it s essential to deal with democrats mr romney yeah , you have to mr rose and to be prepared to compromise on the big issues of our time \? mr romney you have to stand by your principles at the same time , you know that good democrats and good republicans who love the country first will be able to find common ground from time to time and recognize we ca n't keep on spending like we 're spending we ca n't demand more from tax revenue from people , because that kills jobs and hurts working families we have got to help the middle class in this country the only way that 'll come together is if you have people on both sides of the aisle who will listen to a leader who has the experience of leading and that s what america s looking for and desperately longing for mr rose and back to governor perry this plan that you would like to lay out because governor romney has said you 've had two months to produce a plan , an economic plan he s had a 59point plan what s the plan \? what will you say specifically \? gov perry well , clearly , opening up a lot of the areas of our domestic energy area that s the real key you 've got an administration that , by and large , has either by intimidation or over regulation , put our energy industry and the rest of the economy in jeopardy and we 've got to have a president who is willing to stand up and to clearly pull back those regulations that are strangling the american entrepreneurship that s out there and it does n't make any difference whether it s obamacare , whether it s doddfrank , or whether it s the tax burden , a president , particularly with the plan that i'm going to be laying out over the next three days and i'm not going to lay it out all for you tonight you know , mitt s had six years to be working on a plan i 've been in this for about eight weeks but clearly , we 're going to be focused on initially the energy industry in this country and making america again independent and clearly the place where domestic energy needs to be produced from mr rose let me introduce my friend karen karen \? karen tumulty congresswoman bachmann , three years after the financial meltdown , main street continues to suffer people have lost their jobs , they 've lost their homes , they 've lost their faith in the future but wall street is thriving the banks not only got bailed out by the government they made huge profits they paid themselves huge bonuses do you think it s right that no wall street executives have gone to jail for the damage they did to the economy \? representative michele bachmann \( rmn \) i think if you look at the problem with the economic meltdown , you can trace it right back to the federal government , because it was the federal government that demanded that banks and mortgage companies lower platinumlevel level lending standards to new lows it was ms tumulty but the federal government had also deregulated them rep bachmann it was the federal government that pushed the subprime loans it was the federal government that pushed the community reinvestment act it was congressman barney frank and also senator chris dodd that continued to push governmentdirected housing goals they pushed the banks to meet these rules and if banks failed to meet those rules , then the federal government said , we wo n't let you merge we wo n't let you grow there s a real problem it began with the federal government , and it began with feddie and freddie and fannie if you look at these secondary mortgage companies , which the federal government is essentially backing 100 percent , they put american mortgages in a very difficult place we had artificially low interest rates freddie and fannie were the center of the universe on the mortgage meltdown , and we had lending standards lowered for the first time in american history the fault goes back to the federal government and that s what s wrong with doddfrank doddfrank institutionalized all of these problems that were put into effect by the federal government that s what i introduced the bill to repeal doddfrank it s the jobs and housing destruction act ms tumulty so speaker gingrich , it sounds like congresswoman bachmann does not believe that wall street is to blame for the financial mess you 've said that the current protests on wall street are , in your words , the natural product of obama s class warfare and i think it is corrupt and it is wrong for one man to have that kind of secret power ms tumulty so , congressman paul , where do you come down this \? \( laughter , cross talk \) representative ron paul \( rtx \) the one thing one thing i might might say that we have made some inroads on the federal reserve we passed a bill last year we got a partial , you know , audit of the fed we 've learned a whole lot they were dealing in 15 trillion five trillion \( dollars \) went overseas to bail out foreign banks but you know what \? the congress did a lot i 've worked on it for a good many years but bloomberg helped and fox helped they had court cases , freedom of information act , and there are some , even at this table , who did n't think auditing the fed was such a good idea , that we could call up the fed and ask him and it would tell us what to do and i 've been calling them up for 30 years and they never tell me \( laughter \) but we 're getting to the bottom of it but if you want to understand why we have a problem , you have to understand the fed , because the cause comes from the business cycle we should n't be asking what to do exactly with the recession obviously we have to deal with that but you ca n't solve , you ca n't cure the disease if you do n't know the cause of it and the cause is the booms when there are booms , and they 're artificial , whether it s the cra or whether it s the fed , easy credit , when you have bubbles , whether it s the nasdaq or whether it s the housing bubbles mr rose ok rep paul they burst and when they do , you have to have corrections and that s what we 're dealing with and we can do this by building coalitions mr rose thank you rep paul and not sacrificing any principles mr rose julianna julianna goldman thank you , charlie senator santorum , i want to turn to jobs , because you 've said that when you were growing up in a steel town in pennsylvania , 21 percent of the country was involved in manufacturing now it s down to 9 percent can those jobs ever return \? and what would you do to create jobs now \? rick santorum yeah , the jobs can come back if you create a climate for them to be profitable i i we have a lot of businesspeople , manufacturers in pennsylvania i do n't know a single one who wanted to ship their jobs offshore , who did n't want them in their own community to be able to employ people and see the fruits of their labor being benefiting the community that they live in what happened was we became uncompetitive so we need to be competitive and that s why i proposed taking the corporate tax from manufacturers and processors , taking it from 35 percent and eliminating it , zero percent tax allow this to be the the the manufacturing capital of the world again take that money 12 trillion that over that s overseas from manufacturers who did send their jobs overseas bring it back , zero percent tax rate if you invest it in plant and equipment in this country repeal every regulation the obama administration has put in place that s over 100 million repeal them all you may have to replace a few , but let s repeal them all because they are all antagonistic to businesses , particularly in the manufacturing sector and do as governor perry suggested we need a bold energy plan i 've put one out there to drill pennsylvania i do n't want to brag , governor , but pennsylvania is the gas capital of the world right now , not texas , because mr rose all right ms goldman but mr santorum we are we 're doing a great job and energy prices and gas went down by 75 percent ms goldman but let me just follow up because we are in a crisis so what would you do right now to create jobs \? mr santorum the the cool thing about my plan as opposed to herman s plans and some of the other plans out here , it 'll pass tomorrow it would pass tomorrow why \? because industrialstate democrats want those jobs and they know if we put a promanufacturing jobs plan on the table it will pass overnight we 'll get votes from indiana and pennsylvania and ohio and michigan , all of those states so it s not just proposing a plan that will get get things started that the wall street journal will smile at excuse me , the washington post or but it s a plan that can actually pass and get things done and bring people together that s why i put it on the table ms goldman thank you i want to follow up now to governor huntsman from the erie canal to the internet , it s what innovation is what s always fueled economic recovery so should n't the focus now be on trying to create the innovative jobs of tomorrow \? and what do you think those are \? jon huntsman we need to regain our industrial base i would , first and foremost , disagree with rick on one measure and that is , pennsylvania is not the gas capital of the country washington , dc , is the gas capital of the country \( laughter \) gov perry \( that s ok that s ok \? \) mr huntsman there are two things that critically need to be done for us to stay ahead in this highly competitive world , and when we lose one or both of them , we lose out to the chinese and the indians one is maintaining a strong commitment to innovation , entrepreneurship and freedom in the marketplace we have the sense of innovation that no country has been able to replicate some have tried , and some will continue to try , but nobody does it like we do here and that gives rise to high technology , to regular manufacturing jobs cross the board it makes this economy hum when it s working well the second part of this you need a marketplace , like rick described a moment ago , in which you can translate those innovations into products we are losing our ability to maintain a competitive marketplace today mr rose all right mr huntsman that s taxes , that s regulation we 've lost it to others , so right now we 're not able to translate innovation to the we 've got to regain the magic of a strong marketplace , so that we have the complete package mr rose karen ms tumulty congressman gingrich speaker gingrich , medicare newt gingrich newt \( off mic \) ms tumulty \( laughs \) medicare is going broke consider the fact that half of all medicare spending is done in the last two years of life and research that has done been done right here at dartmouth by the dartmouth atlas would suggest that much of this money is going to treatments and interventions that do nothing to prolong life , or to improve it in fact , some of it does the opposite do you consider this wasteful spending \? and if so , should the government do anything about it \? mr gingrich you know , i'm really glad you asked that , because i was just swapping emails today with andy von eschenbach , who was the head of the national cancer institute , the head of the food and drug administration but before that , he was the provost at md anderson , the largest cancer treatment center in the world and he wrote me to point out that the most recent us government intervention on whether or not to have prostate testing is basically going to kill people so if you ask me , do i want some washington bureaucrat to create a class action decision which affects every american s last two years of life , not ever i think it is a disaster i think , candidly , governor palin got attacked unfairly for describing what would would , in fact , be death panels and and what von eschenbach will tell you if you call him is the decision to suggest that we not test men for with psa will mean that a number of people who do not have the who are susceptible to a very rapid prostate cancer will die unnecessarily and there was not a single urologist not a single specialist on the board that looked at it so i'm i'm opposed to class intervention for these things ms tumulty well , congresswoman bachmann , of course no one wants the government to come between a doctor and a patient , but do you think that americans are getting the most for their money in medicare spending \? and how can we make sure that the money that is being spent is being spent on the treatments and the and the preventive treatments that do the most \? rep bachmann we have a big problem today when it comes to medicare , because we know that nine years from now , the medicare hospital part b trust fund is going to be dead flat broke so we 've got to deal with this issue i was in the white house with president obama this summer we asked him not once but three times president obama , what is your plan to save medicare \? and the president mumbled and he did n't give an answer the first time , the second time and the third time the president said something very interesting , karen he said obamacare i think that senior citizens across the country have no idea that president obama plans for medicare to collapse , and instead everyone will be pushed into obamacare and just like newt gingrich said , the way that obamacare runs , there s a board called ipab it s made up of 15 political appointees these 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million americans i do n't want 15 political appointees to make a health care decision for a beautiful , fragile , 85yearold woman who should be making her own decision mr rose we 'll come back to medicare as well and medical issues and the cost of medical in the united states i want to talk about advisers and appointees tell me , governor huntsman , whose advice do you seek on economic issues \? and who what s the profile of the kind of person you 'd like to have advising you in your white house \? mr huntsman i 'd like the profile of my own father , who was a great entrepreneur and he started with nothing , and he built a great business , and my brother now runs that business people who have been out in the world , who have actually had their hands on products and manufacturing and know something about how to build something from the ground up that s what this country has always done , is what we need to continue to do but in order to have the right policies in place and some i put forward as governor of the great state of utah tax reform i created a flat tax in the state of utah it took that state to the numberone position in terms of job creation regulatory reform and energy independence i want the kind of people who understand what makes an economy work but let s be real about what it takes to get into federal government service these days who on earth from the private sector is ever going to want to give up their privacy and enter government service with the background checks , the financial disclosures , and everything else that serve as tremendous disincentives for good people to get into government so what we have today , charlie , we 've got a professional governing class of people on one end , and then you 've got private sector \( inaudible \) on the other mr rose and so what would you do about that to change that , to attract those mr huntsman we need mr rose kind of people so that they would be willing to serve a cross section of people from every mr huntsman let s get back to mr rose \( inaudible \) mr huntsman what we did a generation or two ago when we were more open in terms of accommodating people from all backgrounds who wanted to take a little bit of their life and serve in government , and then leave and go back to what it is they did best , whether on the farm or whether insurance or whether business or whether academia mr rose when you mentioned the flat tax , does that mean that you look with some favor upon 999 that herman cain mentioned at the beginning of this conversation \? mr huntsman i think it s a catchy phrase in fact , i thought it was a price of a pizza when i first heard about it , herman \( laughter , applause \) mr rose \( \? \) price of a pizza mr huntsman here s here s here s what here s what we need we need something that s doable , doable , doable and what i have put forward is a tax program that is doable it actually wipes clean all of the loopholes and the deductions this is right out of what the simpsonbowles commission recommended a bipartisan group of people that took a thoughtful approach to tax for corporate and individual individual , and on the corporate side , phase out all of the corporate welfare , all of the subsidies because we ca n't afford it any longer in a revenueneutral fashion , buy down the rate from 35 percent to 25 percent , leveling the playing field for businesses big and small , allowing us to be a whole lot more competitive in the second decade of the 21st century mr rose julianna ms goldman thank you we will be coming back to 999 , but first mr cain \( now \? \) , wait , wait ms goldman well , but but mr cain he mentioned me mr rose give him 30 seconds mr cain and he \( inaudible \) me , and you did n't give me an opportunity to respond mr rose and you have that opportunity \( now \? \) mr cain thank you very much \( laughter \) 999 will pass , and it is not the price of pizza because , it has been wellstudied and welldeveloped it starts with , unlike your proposals , throwing out the current tax code continuing to pivot off the current tax code is not going to boost this economy this is why we developed 999 9 percent corporate business flat tax , 9 percent personal income flat tax , and a 9 percent national sales tax and it will pass , senator , because the american people want it to pass mr rose this is beginning to sound more like my table julianna i mean , karen ms tumulty mr cain , who do you turn to for political advice and for economic advice \? mr cain my advisers come from the american people now , i will have some experts one of my experts that helped me to develop this is a gentleman by the name of rich lowry out of cleveland , ohio he is an economist , and he has worked in the business of wealth creation most of his career i also have a number of other well recognized economists that helped me to develop this 999 plan it did n't come off a pizza box , no it was well studied and well developed because it will replace the corporate income tax , the personal income tax , the capital gains tax , the death tax , and most importantly the payroll tax ms tumulty so who are some of these economists \? mr cain rich lowry out of cleveland , texas is one of the economists that i have used he s been my lead economists on helping to develop this mr rose julianna ms goldman thank you governor romney , it s 2013 and the european debt crisis has worsened , countries are defaulting , europe s largest banks are on the verge of bankruptcy , contagion has spread to the us , and the global financial system is on the brink what would you do differently than what president bush , henry paulson and ben bernanke did in 2008 \? mr romney well , you 're you 're talking about a scenario that s obviously very difficult to imagine , and and and ms goldman but it s not a hypothetical because more than half the mr romney it it is i'm i'm afraid it is a hypothetical ms goldman it s not governor , it s not a mr romney do you want to explain why it s not a hypothetical \? ms goldman yes mr romney ok ms goldman because more than half the country believes that a financial meltdown is likely in the next several years , and the us banks have at least 700 billion in exposure to europe so it s a very real threat , and voters want to know what you would do differently mr romney there it s still a hypothetical as to what s going to precisely happen in the future i'm not very good at being omniscient , but i can tell you this that i'm not going to have to call up timothy geithner and say how does the economy work , because i 've spent my life in the economy i spent my entire career working in the private sector , starting businesses , helping turn around businesses , sometimes successfully and sometimes not and i know how to make tough decisions , and to gather the input of people from around the country to help make the important decisions that have to be made clearly if you think the entire financial system is going to collapse , you take action to keep that from happening in the case of europe right now , they 're looking at what s happening with greece are they going to default on their debt \? are they not \? that s a decision which i would like to have input on , if i were president of the united states , and try and prevent the kind of contagion that would affect the us banking system and put us at risk but i can tell you this i'm not interested in bailing out individual institutions that have wealthy people that want to make sure that their shares are worth something i am interested in making sure that we preserve our financial system , our currency , the banks across the entire country , and i will always put the interest of the american people ahead of the interests of any institution ms goldman but so would you so would you or would you not be open to another wall street bailout \? mr romney well , no one likes the idea of a wall street bailout i certainly do n't asset asset ms goldman but you said in 2008 that it prevented the collapse of the financial mr romney there s no question but that the action that president bush and that secretary paulson took was designed to keep not just a collapse of individual banking institutions but to keep the entire currency of the country worth something and to keep all the banks from closing and to make sure we did n't all lose our jobs my my experience tells me that we were on the on the precipice and we could have had a complete meltdown of our entire financial system , wiping out all the savings of the american people so action had to be taken was it perfect \? no was it wellimplemented \? no , not particularly were there some institutions that should not have been bailed out \? absolutely should they have used the funds to bail out general motors and chrysler \? no , that was the wrong source for that funding but this but this approach of saying , look , we 're going to have to preserve our currency and maintain america and our financial system is is essential mr rose so you agree you agree with speaker gingrich about ben bernanke , the chairman of the fed \? mr romney i would n't keep ben bernanke in office i 'd choose someone of my of my own \( inaudible \) mr rose and who might that be \? mr romney well , i have n't chosen that person i have n't even chosen a vice president i'm not sure i'm the nominee yet \( laughter \) mr rose well , we 'd like to we 'd like to have we would like to have nor has anyone else , but we 'd like to have an idea of the kind of people , you know , that you would have confidence in , in playing this very important role although , congressman paul may differ about how important it is mr romney well , i wish we could find milton friedman again although what milton said to us was , he said , you know , if you took all the economists in america , and you laid them end to end , it would be a good thing and i \( laughter \) and i have more respect for economists than that the people who help guide my economic policy are greg mankiw at harvard mr rose right mr romney and glenn hutchins at columbia they were both former chairs of the council of economic advisers i do n't always agree with them i also talk to a number of business leaders i talk to people who are currently in the economy , in the financial sector , and in the manufacturing sector and on the basis of these various viewpoints i make my decisions and i believe that drawing on the best minds in this country , including economists , is something that s essential to make sure that we preserve our financial system right now america s in crisis we do n't need to think about a hypothetical of what happens if europe explodes and pulls us under although , if that does happen , you want to have someone who s smart , who has experience , who knows how the financial services sector works , who knows how to protect american jobs and i do i 've done it mr rose and as far as you 're concerned , there s no institution no financial institution that s too big to fail mr romney well , no , you do n't you do n't you do n't want to bail out anybody the idea of trying to bail out an institution to protect its shareholders or to protect a certain interest group that s a terrible idea , and that should n't happen you do want to make sure we do n't lose the country , and we do n't lose our financial system , and we do n't lose american jobs , and that all the banks do n't go under so you have to take action very carefully to make sure that you preserve our currency and preserve our financial system but bailouts of individual institutions \? no one has interest in that , i do n't think ms goldman mr cain , back in 2008 , you wrote that the wall street bailout was a winwin for the taxpayer you just heard governor romney do you agree \? mr cain conceptually , i made that statement based upon the concept , but i happen to agree with governor romney the way it was administered is where it got off track they were discretionary in which institutions they were going to save , rather than apply it equitably , which is what most of us thought was going to be done the implementation of it is where they got off track i did n't agree with it i do n't think governor romney agreed with it , so did a lot of us the implementation was at fault mr rose housing is considered one of the real problems in terms of our economy , and getting housing starts up mr gingrich can i say one thing before we go to housing \? mr rose yes mr gingrich because i think this is really important there s a real possibility that you ca n't have the euro and the greek economy in the same system there s a possibility we could have a meltdown in the next year the thing that is most obvious , looking back , is that paulson and bernanke and geithner did n't have a clue not because they 're not smart , but because they were operating in a world that has suddenly changed so radically , they did n't know mr rose all right mr gingrich one of the reasons i 've said that the congress should insist that every decision document from 2008 , 2009 and 2010 at the fed be released is we are not any better prepared today for a crisis of that scale , because the people who were in that crisis and were wrong are still in charge and i think we need to learn what did they do right mr rose all right mr gingrich and what did they do learn wrong precisely for the reason you raised about 2013 mr rose let me go to housing what would you do would you get the federal government out of housing \? yes \? rep paul absolutely i mean , there s no need to look at the mr rose no freddie no freddie mac , no fannie mae , nothing \? rep paul no , that s where the distortions come that s where the moral hazard comes from that s where the malinvestment overbilled it was predictable you talked about what economists we should look to , and unfortunately we 've been living with keynesian economics for many , many decades , and everybody who was right about predicting the bubbles were austrian economists they said they were coming and yet they 're also saying and i agree with them that everything that we 're doing right now is wrong so what we did with the housing bubble , yes , we had too many houses it was glaring in our face the bubble was doomed to burst , and it came because of fannie mae , freddie mac , easy credit , and also the community reinvestment act so who who got into trouble \? the people who did the speculating and the wall street , the derivatives market they got the bailout they got privileges so what happened to the middle class \? they lost their jobs they lost their houses this whole system is all messed up and you 're what i hear here is just tinkering with the current system and not looking at something new and different , and it s a freemarket economy without a federal reserve system , with sound money if you do n't have that , you 're going to continue with a bubble and this propping up this debt and keeping the correction you need the correction you need to get rid of the malinvestment and the debt the debt is the burden on the economy mr rose time all right , we 'll be back take a break and be right back stay with us from dartmouth in hanover , new hampshire \( announcements \) mr rose in order to take the pulse of america , we have partnered with linkedin linkedin and they have some 120 billion \( sic \) networked professionals , and we 've asked them to take part in this by giving us some polling that they have done but before i bring some of those results in , i want to take a look at a series of clips we 'll show you in this segment , beginning with this one of a former president \( begin videotaped segment \) former president ronald reagan the singlemost important question facing us tonight is , do we reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying their fair share , or do we accept bigger budget deficits , higher interest rates and higher unemployment simply because we disagree on certain features of a legislative package which offers hope for millions of americans at home , on the farm and in the workplace \? \( end videotaped segment \) mr rose let me go to the governor of texas do you agree with the former president \? gov perry well , i think we 're certainly talking about different times , because what i heard him say there , that he was willing to trade tax increases for reductions , and i do n't think he ever saw those reductions , he just saw the tax increase as a matter of fact , in his diary he made that statement that he s still looking around for those those reductions so i mean , from the standpoint that s one of the problems that we got in washington , dc one of the reasons that i think americans are so untrustworthy of what s going on in washington is because they never see a cut in spending they always hear the the siren song of , you know , if you 'll allow us to raise taxes , then we 'll make these reductions over here , when the fact of the matter is the issue is we need to have a balanced budget amendment to the united states constitution \( applause \) and the next president of the united states needs to spend his time passing a balanced budget amendment to the united states constitution mr rose but i want to stay with this idea of spending cuts and revenue increases and go back to you , governor romney this is where it is , it seems in washington right now , not only the paralysis , but also you got the supercommittees and if in fact they ca n't find an agreement , you 're going to have a trigger with automatic cuts , including defense so does n't that demand some kind of compromise , as reagan suggested \? mr romney well , i i do n't know what particular compromises he was referring to we can take a look at that but i can tell you this , if you go back a few years before that clip and go to jfk s time , the government at all levels federal , state and local was consuming about 27 percent of the us economy today it consumes about 37 percent of the us economy it s on track to get to 40 percent we cease at some point to be a free economy and the idea of saying , we just want a little more , just give us some more tax revenue , we need that , that is the answer for america the answer is to cut federal spending the answer is to cap how much the federal government can spend as a percentage of our economy and have a balanced budget amendment and the second part of the answer is to get our economy to grow , because the idea of just cutting and cutting and taxing more i understand mathematically those things work , but nothing works as well as getting the economy going ms tumulty but can we mr romney get americans back to work get them paying taxes get get corporations growing in america , investing in america bring dollars back , as rick said , repatriation dollars bring a trillionthree \( dollars \) back from overseas invest in the united states get this economy going and i 'll tell you , these kinds of problems will disappear ms tumulty but could we get back to the actual choice that is likely to confront congress at the end of the year , which is some mix of revenues and cuts or these draconian automatic spending cuts that would include defense which of those two , if that is the choice , would you prefer \? mr romney well , my choice is not to cut defense i think it s a terrible idea to cut defense i think it s a terrible idea to raise taxes particularly at a time when the economy s struggling , the idea of raising taxes , taking more money away from the american people , so government can spend it , and can spend it right now the president has a jobs bill ms tumulty so this is mr romney how 'd his last jobs bill work out for us \? ms tumulty but this is the automatic cut mr romney not not so well ms tumulty \( inaudible \) \? mr romney yeah , the no , i do not want the automatic cuts i want to see that supercommittee take responsibility for getting the economy going again by reining in the scale of the federal government mr rose ok mr romney and saying we 're going to pull back on some of the programs we have mr rose all right mr romney and reform our entitlements , so they 're sustainable the american people want to see growth and jobs , and they believe that the right way to do it is by cutting back on the scale of government and they 're right mr rose without any increase in revenue \? \( applause \) \( cross talk \) mr gingrich i just want to say one i want to say one thing about the entire way washington works , which was just posed in that question first of all , the congress could n't figure out how to get the debt ceiling done with a president who shows zero leadership , so they adopt a truly stupid bill , ok \? and the bill basically says we 're either going to shoot ourselves in the head , or cut off our right leg and we 'll come in and around thanksgiving , and we 'll show you how we 're going to cut off the right leg and the alternative will be shooting ourselves in the head let me just say bluntly , all of the spending cuts that are built into the debt ceiling bill all of them are acts of congress they can all be repealed at any moment it is nonsense to say we 're going to disarm the united states unilaterally because we 're too stupid to balance the budget any other way \( applause \) mr rose all right congressman bachmann rep bachmann charlie , last summer i was a leading voice in the wilderness of washington , and a lone voice as a matter of fact , saying do not increase the debt ceiling by that , what i was saying is , let s not give barack obama another 24 trillion blank check to spend think of what this means our government right now this is significant we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in we all paid a lot of taxes this year we paid 22 trillion in taxes that s a lot of money from all the american people the american government spent a hundred percent of that 22 trillion \( dollars \) but the travesty is they spent 15 trillion \( dollars \) more than that that s the problem every year , we are spending about 40 percent more than what we take in our answer has to be that we cut back on the spending so we get to balance we ca n't do this because all mr rose will cutting back on the spending rep bachmann all around us are young people that are going to be paying for this burden and their tax rates wo n't be our tax rates their tax rates could come at some point , their overall effective burden i'm a federal tax lawyer that s what i do for a living and my background is in economics their tax rates some day in their peak earning years , charlie , could be as much as 75 percent who s going to get out of bed in the morning to go to work , if they 're paying 75 percent tax rates \? we 've got to get our spending house in order and cut back on spending mr rose cutting back on spending , in your judgment , will do it \? rep bachmann that s one piece of the answer that s not the whole answer mr rose yeah rep bachmann but we have to cut taxes mr rose i want you to take a look we 'll come to all of you , but let me take a look at another clip this one you will recognize as well here it is \( begin videotaped segment \) mr cain it s called the 999 plan \( applause \) it imposes a 9 percent business flat tax , a 9 percent personal flat tax and a 9 percent national sales tax \( end videotaped segment \) mr rose go ahead , julianna ms goldman thanks i said we would get back to 999 \( laughter \) mr cain , you say that your plan is revenue neutral and last year , the us collected 22 trillion in tax revenue but bloomberg government has run the numbers , and your plan would have raised no more than 2 trillion and even with that shortfall , you 'd still be slapping a 9 percent sales tax on food and medicine mr cain the problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect \( laughter , applause \) ms goldman well well mr cain the the reason the reason it s incorrect is because they start with assumptions that we do n't make remember , 9 99 plan throws out the current tax code and it starts with three simple economic driving principles production drives the economy risktaking drives growth and we need sound money measurements must be dependable now , what 999 does , it expands the base when you expand the base , we can arrive at the lowest possible rate , which is 999 the difference between the 999 plan and the other plans that are being proposed is that they pivot off of the existing tax code we 've had an outside firm independent firm mr rose all right mr cain dynamically score it , and so our numbers will make it revenue neutral mr rose all right karen go ahead i'm sorry , go ahead ms goldman but then explain why , under your plan , all americans should be paying more for milk , for a loaf of bread , and beer \? mr rose and pizza ms goldman yeah , and pizza \( laughs \) mr cain i do n't buy beer \( laughter \) you have to start with the biggest tax cut a lot of americans pay , which is the payroll tax , 153 percent that goes to 9 percent that s a 6 percentage point difference , and the prices will not go up so they 've got a 6 percentage point difference to apply to the national sales tax piece of that , and in doing so they have the flexibility to decide on how much they want to spend it on new goods , how much they want to spend it on used goods mr rose all right mr cain because there is no tax on used goods ms goldman but congresswoman bachmann , you 're a former irs lawyer do you agree \? rep bachmann i would have to say the 999 plan is n't a jobs plan , it is a tax plan and i would say that from my experience being in congress but also as a federal tax lawyer , when you the last thing you would do is give congress another pipeline of a revenue stream , and this gives congress a pipeline in a sales tax a sales tax can also lead to a value added tax the united states congress put into place the spanishamerican war tax in in 1898 we only partially repealed that in 2006 so once you get a new revenue stream , you 're never going to get rid of it and one thing i would say is , when you take the 999 plan and you turn it upside down , i think the devil s in the details \( laughter \) mr rose all right i have to mr cain you 've got to let me respond mr rose we 've given you several chances to respond i 'll come back we will continue to talk about taxes and spending we also know here that there has been a paradigm shift in the world economic order we know about china and we know about india here is our next clip , and we will respond from that here it is \( video begins \) mr romney and i will label china as it is , a currency manipulator , and i will go after them for stealing our intellectual property , and they will recognize that if they cheat , there is a price to pay i certainly do n't want a trade war with anybody , and we 're not going to have a trade war , but we ca n't have a trade surrender either \( video ends \) mr rose karen ms tumulty governor huntsman , you were also ambassador to china , and you say that this would risk a trade war but if china is indeed keeping its currency low , that means that everything they sell in this country is artificially cheap and everything that our companies try to sell in china is artificially expensive so what do you say to people who ask , are n't we already in a trade war with china \? mr huntsman well , first of all , i do n't subscribe to the don trump school or the mitt romney school of international trade i do n't want to find ourselves in a trade war with respect to china , if you start slapping penalties on them based on countervailing duties , you 're going to get the same thing in return because what they 're going to say , because of quantitative easing part one and part two , you 're doing a similar thing to your currency and then you 're going to find yourself in a trade war very , very quickly and what does that do \? that disadvantages our small businesses it disadvantages our exporters it disadvantages our agricultural producers so i say , for the first and the secondlargest economies in the world , we have no choice we have to find common ground we have to of course use our trade laws , and use them very , very aggressively but at the end of the day , we 've got to find more marketopening measures we 've got to get more governors from this country together with governors from provinces of china , mayors together with mayors , and exploit the opportunities that exist for exporters that s a job creator in this country it s a huge job creator and we have to get used to the fact that as far as the eye can see into the 21st century , it s going to be the united states and china on the world stage ms tumulty you know , governor romney , this issue does carry a lot of resonance , especially in states like new hampshire which , as you probably know , has lost a greater percentage of its manufacturing jobs to china than any other state but voters have heard candidates talk tough on china before george w bush did it , barack obama did it only to see that , once elected , the president takes a much more cautious approach , because of the complexity of the relationship and the fact that this is our biggest creditor why should voters believe that you would be any different \? mr romney i'm afraid that people who 've looked at this in the past have been played like a fiddle by the chinese and the chinese are smiling all the way to the bank , taking our currency and taking our jobs and taking a lot of our future and i'm not willing to let that happen i'm in this race to try and get america to make sure we 're strong again , we 're creating jobs , we 're the best place in the world to be middle class again and for that to happen , we 've got to call cheating for what it is ms tumulty but is mr romney and you ca n't you ca n't you know , people say , well , we might have a trade war with china well , now , think about that we buy this much stuff from china they buy that much stuff from us you think they want to have a trade war \? i mean , this is this is a time when we 're being hollowed out by china that is artificially holding down their prices , as you just said a moment ago and that s having a massive impact on jobs here it is the wrong course for us , when people have pursued unfair trade practices you have to have a president that will take action and on day one i 've indicated , day one i will issue an executive order identifying china as a currency manipulator we 'll bring an action against them in front of the wto for manipulating their currency , and we will go after them if you 're not willing to stand up to china , you 'll get run over by china and that s what s happened for 20 years \( applause \) ms tumulty but as recently as gov perry but we 're mr rose let me go to governor perry and then governor then governor huntsman governor perry gov perry we 're missing this so much what we need to be focused on in this country today is not whether or not we 're going to have this policy or that policy what we need to be focused on is how we get america working again that s where we need to be focused and let me tell you , we 're sitting on this absolute treasure trove of of energy in this country and i do n't need 999 , we do n't need any plan to pass congress we need to get a president of the united states that is committed to passing the types of of regulations , pulling the regulations back , freeing this country to go develop the energy industry that we have in this country i can promise you that we do that and we 'll create an environment in this country where the manufacturing will come back to this country we did it in texas we brought chi manufacturing , that had business in china , back to the state of texas you free up this country s entrepreneurs where they know that they can risk their capital and have a chance to have a return on investment and all of this conversation that we 're having today becomes substantially less impactful mr rose all right i want to come back to these issues , but let me introduce speaking of ceos and business this is a new hampshire native his name is david cote he is chairman and ceo of honeywell , and he is a former member of the simpsonbowles commission here he is david cote \( chairman and ceo , honeywell \) \( from videotape \) twenty years ago there were a billion people actively participating in the global economy today there are more than 4 billion active participants in the global economy , with china , india , former cis states and other emerging economies now in the game while that is a good and peaceful phenomenon , it also means we need to compete more strongly than we did in the past we need an american competitiveness agenda we need to inspire that american competitive spirit that has served us so well for over 200 years i would like to ask , what would be on your american competitiveness agenda \? and with one last small request my guess is , all of us are ready to accept that we 're a great country and a great people , so if your response could focus on specifics , it would be much appreciated thank you mr rose senator santorum , we talked about jobs in pennsylvania a competitive agenda of yours would be what \? mr santorum well , i already put forward a plan you know , mitt , i do n't want to go to a trade war i want to beat china i want to go war with china and and make america the most attractive place in the world to do business , and we need to do that with the agenda that i outlined , which , unlike herman s plan , which could not pass , because no how many people here are for a sales tax in new hampshire \? raise your hand there you go , herman that s how many votes you 'll get in new hampshire mr rose yeah mr santorum you know , we 're not going to we 're not going to give the we 're not going to give the federal government , nancy pelosi , a new pipeline , a 9 percent sales tax , for consumers to get hammered by the federal government how many people believe that we 'll keep the income tax at 9 percent \? anybody \? there there s that s why people wo n't trust mr rose all right so if you keep mr santorum giving people \( inaudible \) if you if you give us a plan mr rose if you keep mentioning 999 and herman cain , i'm going to have to go back to him every other question \( cross talk , laughter \) mr cain that s right \( applause \) mr santorum charlie , whoa , whoa i'm not done yet mr cain thank you mr rose \( chuckles \) mr santorum i'm not done yet i 've i 've only been able to answer one question , unlike everybody else here , so let let me just finish what i'm saying mr rose right mr santorum we need to repeal obamacare that s the first thing we need to do we want to create jobs i went to osippi \( ph \) today and i talked to a smallbusiness man there , and he said i will not hire anybody , i will not do i will not make a move until i find out what s going to happen with this health care bill and how it s going to crush me and and and so repealing obamacare and we can do it , not by waivers that s the wrong idea , mitt and you reason it s the wrong idea because you get a waiver california going to waive that \? no new york going to waive it \? no all these states many of them , liberal states are going to continue on , and then states like new hampshire that will waive it will end up subsidizing california mr rose all right mr santorum we need to repeal it let me finish mr rose yes , you do , but you mr santorum we need to repeal it mr rose all right , but their time mr santorum i know well , i'm mr rose time you see the red light time ! mr santorum \( spending up the \? \) time we need to repeal it mr rose all right mr santorum by doing it through a reconciliation process , and since i have the experience and know how to do that , we 'll take care of and get it rid of it the first mr rose i 've got to go to the break and i'm but i'm both give both herman cain and governor romney a chance to make their point , because they were both mentioned first cain , then romney , then break mr cain therein lies the difference between me , the nonpolitician , and all of the politicians they want to pass what they think they can get passed , rather than what we need , which is a bold solution 999 is bold , and the american people want a bold solution , not just what s going to kick the can down the table down the road mr rose governor romney \( applause \) mr romney rick , you 're absolutely right on day one , granting a waiver for to all 50 states does n't stop in its tracks entirely obamacare that s why i also say we have to repeal obamacare , and i will do that on day two with a reconciliation bill , because , as you know , it was passed by reconciliation , 51 votes we can get rid of it with 51 votes we have to get rid of obamacare and return to the states the responsibility mr \( inaudible \) mr romney no , not if you get rid of it and by the way , the supreme court may get rid of it mr \( inaudible \) mr romney let me finish let me finish mr rose ok let him finish , then we 'll go to huntsman , then we go to break and then when we come back , each of you can question each other \( laughter , applause \) mr romney all right \( that s a good deal \? \) and let me let me just say this , which is , we all agree about repeal and replace and i'm proud of the fact that i put together a plan that says what i'm going to replace it with and i think it s incumbent on everybody around this table to put together a plan that says , this is what i 'll replace it with , because the american people are not satisfied with the status quo they want us to solve the problem of health care , to get it to work like a market , and that s what has to happen mr rose all right government huntsman , then we go mr huntsman it s disingenuous to to just say that you you can can waive it all the way the mandate will be in place the irs is already planning on 19 , 500 new employees to administer that mandate that will stay , and that s the ruinous part of obamacare and that mitt , your plan is not going to do anything mr romney \( inaudible \) a way to repeal it did you miss that \? mr huntsman \( inaudible \) it does n't it does n't repeal the mandate \( cross talk \) mr santorum through reconciliation you can repeal the taxes , you can repeal the spending , and therefore the mandate has no teeth because there s no tax penalty if you do n't enforce \( them \? \) mr rose all right , we have much to talk about when we come back , the candidates will ask questions of each other , after this break \( applause \) \( announcements \) mr rose welcome back we 're at the republican presidential candidates' debate we 're at dartmouth college in new hanover \( sic \) in hanover , new hampshire and we 're pleased now to turn around a bit and have the candidates question each other they will each have 30 seconds to pose and answer will have one minute to respond 30 seconds per question , one minute to respond they 'll proceed in alphabetical order i remember that i want you to remember , as we talk about this , we 're talking about the economy or those things that affect the economy beginning in alphabetical order congresswoman bachmann rep bachmann thank you in the 1980s , ronald reagan introduced an economic miracle and while all of us were wishing and yearning for a third term for ronald reagan , governor perry , you were campaigning and cochairing al gore s election campaign for president of the united states you went on to increase spending in texas by over 50 percent , and you financed that spending by increasing bond debt by over 137 percent that s exactly what barack obama has been doing increasing debt by trillions of dollars how can we trust you to not go down the obama way and overspend and pay for that spending with indebtedness on the backs of the next generation \? gov perry well , i , like most people in the state of texas and in those southern states , grew up a democrat michael reagan and i were talking just the other day , charlie , that i came to the republican party sooner in age than his dad , ronald reagan did and let me just address this issue of the debt in the state of texas texas has the sixthlowest debt per capita when i started as the governor back in 2000 and today , texas has the secondlowest debt per capita in the united states i think that s what america s looking for , is a president of the united states that understands how to balance budgets , how to deal with the spending issue and how to get americans back working again mr rose herman cain question mr cain yes one of my guiding principles has been and will always be surround yourself with good people the 999 plan that i have proposed is simple , transparent , efficient , fair and neutral my question is to governor romney can you name all 59 points in your 160page plan \? and does it satisfy that criteria of being simple , transparent , efficient , fair and neutral \? \( laughter , applause \) mr romney \( laughs \) herman , i i 've had the experience in my life of taking taking on some tough problems and and i must admit that that simple answers are are always very helpful , but oftentimes inadequate and in my view , to get this economy going again , we 're going to have to deal with more than just tax policy and just energy policy , even though both of those are part of my plan and the other parts of my plan are these one is to make sure that we stop the regulatory creep that s occurred in washington and all of the obama regulations we say no to we put a halt on them and reverse all of those that cost jobs number two , we have trade policies that open up new markets to american goods and i lay out a number of things i 'd do in that 59 points that open up more markets to american goods and we of course stop the cheating that goes on we also have to have the rule of law by that i mean you ca n't have the federal government through its friends at the national labor relations board saying to a company like boeing that you ca n't build a factory in a nonunion state that s simply wrong and violates the principle of the rule of law we also have to have institutions that create human capital we 're a capitalist system , but we do n't do n't just believe in in physical capital or financial capital mr rose all right mr romney also human capital we need great schools , great institutions finally , you got to have a government that does n't spend more money than it takes in those are the seven major pillars of those 59 points mr cain so no , it s not simple is what you 're saying mr romney it i let me let me tell you , to get this economy restructured fundamentally to put america on a path to be the most competitive place in the world to create jobs is going to take someone who knows how to do it and it s not one or two things it s a good number of things to get america \( inaudible \) mr rose all right speaker gingrich , question mr gingrich now , governor romney , let me say first of all there s an awful lot in your plan that s very good and that i think would be very helpful if implemented a lot better than what obama is doing but one of the characteristics of obama in his class warfare approach has been to talk about going after people who made over 250 , 000 a year and divide us and i was a little surprised i think it s about page 47 of your plan that you have a capitalgains tax cut for people under 200 , 000 , which is actually lower than the obama model now , as a businessman , you know that you actually lose economic effectiveness if you limit capitalgains tax cuts only to people who do n't get capital gains so i'm curious what was the rationale for setting an even lower base mark than than than obama had \? mr romney well , the reason for giving a tax break to middle income americans is that middleincome americans have been the people who have been most hurt by the obama economy the reason you 're seeing protests , as you indicated , on wall street and across the country is middleincome americans are having a hard time making ends meet not only do we have 25 million people out of work or stopped looking for work , or in parttime jobs needing fulltime employ , we just saw this week that median income in america has declined by 10 percent during the obama years people are having a hard time making ends meet and so if i'm going to use precious dollars to reduce taxes , i want to focus it on where the people are hurting the most , and that s the middle class i'm i'm not worried about rich people they 're doing just fine the very poor have a safety net they 're taken care of but the people in the middle , the hardworking americans , are the people who need a break , and that s why i focus my tax cut right there mr rose governor huntsman mr huntsman since this discussion is all about economics , governor romney , i promise this wo n't be about religion \( laughter \) some \( laughter \) sorry about that , rick since some might see it because of your past employment with bain capital as more of a financial engineer somebody who breaks down businesses , destroys jobs as opposed to creating jobs and opportunity , leveraging up , spinning off , enriching shareholders since you were number 47 as governor of the state of massachusetts where we were number one for example and the whole discussion around this campaign is going to be job creation , how can you win that debate given your background \? mr romney well , my background is quite different than you describe , jon \( chuckles \) so the way i 'll win it is by telling people an accurate rendition of what i 've done in my life and fortunately , people in new hampshire , living next door , have a pretty good sense of that they understand that in the business i was in , we did n't take things apart and cut them off and sell them off we we instead helped start businesses and they know some of the names we started staples , we started the sports authority , we started bright horizons children centers heck , we even started a steel mill in a farm field in indiana and that steel mill operates today and employs a lot of people so we began businesses sometimes we acquired businesses and tried to turn them around typically effectively and net net created tens of thousands of new jobs and i'm proud of the fact that we were able to do that that s a big part of the american system people are not going to in my opinion , are not going to be looking for someone who s not successful they want someone who has been successful and who knows how fundamentally the economy works i look , i i would not be in this race had i spent my life in politics alone nothing wrong with that , of course but right now , with the american people in the kind of financial crisis they 're in , they need someone who knows how to create jobs , and i do mr rose all right congressman paul rep paul since the federal reserve is the engine of inflation , creates the business cycle , produces our recessions and our depressions , the federal reserve obviously is a very important issue and fortunately tonight , we have a former director of the federal reserve at kansas city , so i have a question for mr cain mr cain , in the past , you 've been rather critical of any of us who would want to audit the fed you said you 've used pretty strong terms , that we were ignorant and that we did n't know what we were doing , and therefore there is no need for a \( n \) audit anyway because if you had one you 're not going to find out everything because everybody knows everything about the fed but now that we have found and we 've gotten an audit , we have found out an awful lot on how special businesses get , you know , bailed out wall street , the banks and special companies , foreign governments and and you said that you advised those of us who are concerned and you belittled you say , call up the federal reserve and just ask em mr rose question \? rep paul to get the pr person so do you still stick by this , that this is a this is frivolous \? or do you think it s very important \? sixtyfour percent of the american people want a full audit of the fed on a regular basis mr rose mr cain \? mr cain first of all , you have misquoted me i did not call you or any of your people ignorant i do n't know where that came from rep paul \( off mic \) mr cain all right \? now , so you got to be careful of the stuff that you get off the internet because that s just not something that i have said \( laughter \) secondly , when i served on the board of the federal reserve in the 1990s , we did n't do any of the things that this federal reserve is doing i do n't agree with the actions of this federal reserve i do n't agree with the actions that have been undertaken by ben bernanke we did n't have a 14 trillion national debt to prop up with some of the actions that they are taking and i have also said , to be precise , i do not object to the federal reserve being audited i simply said if someone wants to initiate that option , go right ahead it does n't bother me so you i 've been misrepresented in that regard i do n't have a problem with the federal reserve being audited it s simply not my top priority my top priority is 999 \( laughter \) jobs , jobs , jobs ! \( applause \) mr rose governor perry , question for gov perry \( chuckles \) governor romney , your chief economic adviser , glenn hubbard , who you know well he said that romneycare was obamacare and romneycare has driven the cost of small business insurance premiums up by 14 percent over the national average in massachusetts so my question for you would be , how would you respond to his criticism of your signature legislative achievement \? mr romney you know , the the great thing about running for president is that you get the chance also to talk about your experience as governor , and i'm proud of the fact that we took on a major problem in my state and the problem was that we had a lot of kids without insurance , a lot of adults without insurance , but it added up to about 8 percent of our population and we said you know what \? we want to find a way to get those folks insured , but we do n't want to change anything for the 92 percent of the people that already have insurance and so our plan dealt with those 8 percent , not the 92 \( percent \) one of the problems with obamacare is , he does n't deal with the people without insurance , he takes over health care for everyone then he does something else that chris christie said today he said the problem with obamacare is he spends an extra trillion dollars and raises taxes and raising taxes is one of the big problems something we did n't do in massachusetts he also cuts medicare ! only but but with people out there talking about medicare it s president obama that did that and i i'm proud of what we were able to accomplish i 'll tell you this , though we have the lowest number of kids , as a percentage , uninsured , of any state in america you have the highest you have over gov perry \( inaudible \) mr romney i'm still i'm still speaking i'm still speaking gov perry mr glenn hubbard s criticism mr romney i'm still speaking we have we have less than 1 percent of our kids they 're uninsured you have a million kids uninsured in texas a million kids under president bush , the percent uninsured went down under your leadership , it s gone up i care about people now our plan is n't perfect glenn hubbard is a fine fellow i \( will \? \) take a look at his quote some people say that just because people say something does n't mean it s true \( chuckles \) the truth is , our plan is different and the people of massachusetts , if they do n't like it , they get rid of it right now , they favor it threetoone but i'm not running for governor of massachusetts i'm running for president of the united states and as president , i will repeal obamacare i 'll grant a waiver on day one to get that started and i 'll make sure that we return to the states what we had when i was governor the right to care for our poor in the way we thought best for our respective states mr rose senator santorum mr santorum romney s before me r mr rose no , i'm sorry , you 're right you 're right \( laughter \) governor romney \( laughs , laughter \) very good \( applause \) i missed school that day i missed school that day when they said r is before s \( laughter \) mr gingrich think of us as your \( inaudible \) mr rose that s right \( laughs \) mr romney you 'd think someone from pbs would know that , would n't you \? \( laughter \) mr rose i was i was thinking how much i was enjoying this \( laughter \) mr romney \( laughs \) yeah , exactly exactly right let me turn to congresswoman bachmann , and just ask you congresswoman , as we 've spoken this evening , we 're all concerned about getting americans back to work and you 've laid out some pretty bold ideas with regards to taxation and cutting back the scale of the federal government and there s no question , that s a very important element of getting people back to work and i 'd like to ask you to expand on your other ideas what do you do to help the american people get back to work , be able to make ends meet \? you 've got families that are sitting around the kitchen table , wondering how they 're going to make it make it to the end of the month you got you got young people coming out of college maybe not here at dartmouth , but a lot of colleges across the country wondering where they can get a job what would you do , beyond the tax policies you described , to get people back to work \? rep bachmann well , i do understand that i'm a mother of 28 kids 23 foster kids , five biological kids i get how difficult it is for young people right now to get jobs right out of college it s very , very tough and the solutions that i'm offering in my plan which , if i can give a commercial , are at michelebachmanncom the solutions that i'm offering are n't just a silver bullet it s not just the tax code it s also dealing with the regulatory burden , because businesses my husband and i started our own successful business i'm 55 i spent my whole life in the private sector i get job creation , too and the business world is looking at 18 trillion \( dollars \) every year in compliance costs with government regulations that has to go so i want to get rid of that it s the mother of all repeal bills but the numberone reason that employers say that they are n't hiring today is obamacare and i was the leading critic for president obama in washington , dc , against obamacare that s why i was the first member of congress to introduce that bill to repeal obamacare i understand that s what s inhibiting job creation and job growth we have to repeal that i also introduced and i fought on barney frank s committee against doddfrank , which is the housing and jobs destruction act that s why i was the chief author of that bill as well mr rose time rep bachmann there s much more to my solutions go to michelebachmanncom and you can find out \( cross talk , laughter \) mr santorum we 're in the live free or die state , and i opposed the singlebiggest government intrusion into the private sector , the wall street bailout , the tarp program i opposed it because it violated the principles of our constitution , the spirit of our constitution , because the experience i had , that if you open up the door of government involvement in the private sector , some president will , and in fact did , drive a truck through it and explode the size of the federal government and constrict our freedom the interesting thing here is , is the four people on this panel that actually supported tarp at the time of its of its passage are the people who say that they are the antiwashington candidates , that they are the business candidates , and they 're the four on this on this program that supported the washington bailout , giving washington naively , i would say tools to constrict our freedom ms so do you have a question for one of them \? more mr santorum my question is you 've you 've prompted it perfectly because here s my question mr cain \( laughs \) mr santorum my question is , since i think herman cain is giving naively a tool in his 999 plan of giving washington a huge new tax tax opportunity to get money through a sales tax , why can we trust you that , with your lack of experience , that you wo n't continually give washington the ability to take freedom away from freedomloving people here in the live free or die state \? mr cain there are three deterrents to the mr santorum and by the way , it s one the four people were governor huntsman , governor perry , herman cain and governor romney all supported tarp mr cain there are three deterrents to this nightmare scenario you described in terms of how bad things are going to be because we are trying to fix the real problem the first deterrent is that i'm going to ask the united states congress to include a twothirds majority vote before they can raise the 999 tax the second deterrent the second deterrent is the fact that because it is visible , simple and transparent , the american people are going to be the ones to hold congress congress' feet to the fire the third deterrent is that i would be president and i wo n't sign anything that raises the 999 mr santorum you 're not going to be president forever mr rose with that we take a break and come back for our final segment stay with us \( applause \) \( announcements \) mr rose we are back at dartmouth in hanover , new hampshire , talking with the eight republican candidates about a variety of issues clearly , we come back to health care i want to go to governor perry explain to me what you think the difference is about your health care ideas and governor romney s health care ideas and how you see mandates and how he sees mandates and the constitution , because not only has there been some exchange here , governor christie got involved today gov perry well , certainly the issue of health care is probably one of the biggest one that s facing us i mean , there are a lot of americans sitting out there today , and and getting those people back to work s the most important thing that we do as a country so that they can have the opportunity to purchase health care and i think that is probably the biggest issue that are facing americans there are people sitting out there around the kitchen table watching tv tonight who are looking for someone to lay out an idea that truly will get this country back working again and that s why i lay out , without having any congressional impact at all , how to get our energy industry back to work and back to work very quickly but in the state of texas , from the standpoint of what we 've done to make access of health care better , we passed the most sweeping tort reform in the nation in in 2003 we also passed healthy texas , which expands the private sector insurance , and we 've driven down the cost of insurance by 30 percent so those are some of the ways that the states but the real issue for us is medicaid and how to get the flexibility on medicaid so that the innovators can occur in the states i can promise you whether it s governor jindal or myself or susana martinez over in new mexico , that s where you 'll find the real innovation in health care the way to deliver health care more efficiently , more effectively is to block grant those dollars back to the state and keep this federal government that has this onesizefitsall mentality from driving the thought process that we 've seen that s destroyed health care in this country today ms tumulty but governor perry , as the washington post fact checker noted , texas has had 16 waivers for medicaid so how can you say that the problem is that the federal government has not given texas enough flexibility \? gov perry they have n't anywhere near given the states i think what you should see is the block granting , not having to go to washington , dc and ask them mother may i every time you come up with a concept or an idea block granting back to the states , i 'll guarantee you the governors and and their innovators in in their states will come up with ways to better deliver health care more efficiently , more effectively , more costefficiently and that s what this country s looking for , is a president who understands that we have these 50 laboratories of innovation free up these states from washington , dc s onesizefitsall mr rose julianna ms goldman thank you , charlie mr cain , you disapprove of fed chairman ben bernanke , and we all know that your priority is 999 but one of the most important appointments that you 're going to have to make your first year , should you be president , would be fed chairman so which federal reserve chairman , over the last 40 years , do you think has been most successful and might serve as a model for that appointment \? mr cain alan greenspan ms goldman why \? mr cain because that s when i served on the board of the federal reserve in the early 1990s , and the way alan greenspan oversaw the fed and the way he coordinated with the way he coordinated with all of the federal reserve banks , i think that it worked fine back in the early 1990s now , on that same point , i have already identified two candidates , which i cannot give their names , to replace the bernanke in anticipation of having that responsibility we must narrow the mission of the fed first i do n't believe in ending the fed i believe we can fix the fed by getting their mission refocused on monetary price stability and i have candidates in mind that will help us do that ms goldman so you have two appointments waiting in the wings for for 2013 , for this when his mr cain yes ms goldman term is up , 2014 \? mr cain yes i have two candidates waiting in the wings to take that job ms goldman how about a hint \? mr cain i got to keep them confidential ms goldman ok congressman paul \? \( laughs , laughter \) rep paul spoken like a true insider \( chuckles \) no , alan greenspan was a disaster \( laughter , applause \) everybody in washington liberals and conservatives said he kept interest rates too low too long of course , the solution was lower em even more , and they think that s going to solve our problems but if i had to name one person that did a little bit of good , that was paul volcker he at least knew how to end or help , you know , end the inflation but of course , with my position that i do n't think highly of the federal reserve and i think we should have sound money and we should n't have somebody deciding what the interest rates should be and how much money supply we should have , i mean , nobody satisfies me but certainly alan greenspan has ushered in the biggest bubble and what did we do \? we 've continued the same thing , doing the same thing we think the inflation of under alan greenspan was bad , so we 're trying to solve the problem by inflating even further so bernanke compounds the problem he s inflating twice as fast as greenspan was but greenspan caused so much trouble and he used to believe in the gold standard i think he s coming around to that and before he retires , he 'll write his biography and explain why he s coming back to the gold standard mr rose i want go to from the gold standard to a small business person who is from new hampshire , who s in the audience with us and has a question about small business , of which she has founded one margot thompson \( ph \) margot thompson \( ph \) businesses like mine have great difficulty obtaining credit what specifically would you do to make bank lending more accessible to small businesses \? mr rose you would direct it to q i was told to direct it to you mr rose oh , governor romney \? \( laughter \) mr romney give her the answer , charlie \( laughter \) mr rose i ask questions , not answer them , governor mr romney oh , ok , ok mr rose i forgot to explain that mr romney what s happened in this country , under the obama administration , is that you have a president who i think is well meaning but just over his head when it comes to the economy and the absolute wrong time to have the absolute wrong people put together a financial regulatory bill was right now and barney frank and chris dodd they were the wrong guys at the wrong time because what they did with this new bill is usher in what will be hundreds and thousands of pages of new regulations the big banks , the big money center banks in wall street , they can deal with that i spoke with one banker there that said they have hundreds of lawyers working on that legislation and trying to implement it for community banks that provide loans to business like yours , they ca n't possibly deal with a regulatory burden like that then you have inspectors coming in and writing down your their their assets and saying they 're not worth as much as the bank thought they were worth , and therefore the banks are unable to lend small community banks across this country are starving and struggling because of inspectors that are making their job impossible and because of regulation that s fine for the big banks , because they can deal with it it s a killer for the small banks and those small banks loaning to small businesses and entrepreneurs are what have typically gotten our economy out of recession what s what the president has done on almost every dimension mr rose all right mr romney is exactly the wrong thing to get this economy going again rep bachmann ok mr rose congresswoman bachmann rep bachmann i 'd like to add to that , because the doddfrank bill is the the jobs and housing destruction act and i have spoken to to iowa bankers , and they told me that they are going to see the collapse of community banks , just like mitt said , all across the state i talked to a banker in texas who owns multiple branch banks he said he s going to lose 20 million \( dollars \) on his bottom line this year because of all of the compliance so government is putting a huge layer of regulation on banks we will literally thousands of banks close their door that will be hard for small business owners like you and like me and so that s going to hurt real people , and it will lead to job destruction mr rose all right rep bachmann that s why i introduced the bill to repeal dodd frank , because it 'll hurt credit , not add to credit and by the way , that s why we see the new 5 debit card fee that people are paying every every month that they 're upset about , because of doddfrank and that was insider dealing , because senator durbin had former staffers that came to lobby him on behalf of retailers this is dirty dealing as president of the united states , i would end all of these payoffs to political donors by by by our legislators that s a that s wrong that s got to end mr rose ok here , and then go over here first , and then there mr cain in addition to what governor romney said , i agree , repeal doddfrank but also , get rid of the capital gains tax that s a big wall between people with ideas and people with money and we know which plan gets rid of the capital gains tax \( laughter \) rep paul i just want to add one quick thing you know , dodd frank , obviously , is a disaster it s estimated it s going to cost a trillion dollars i think one of the reasons we 're not getting anywhere , and we 're not getting anywhere in washington , is it s a partisan fight it s a fight over power because sarbanesoxley , which was done by the republicans , it cost a trillion dollars , too let s repeal that , too i mean , if you look at what we 've done as republicans , we have caused a lot of problems to say it s all in these past two years , i mean , i think that is so misleading that s why the american people are sick and tired of listening to the politics \( inaudible \) mr rose all right , i want to bring my colleagues in karen \? ms tumulty right governor perry , taxpayers stand to lose half a billion dollars in the collapse of solyndra , which is a solar energy firm that was a centerpiece of the obama green jobs initiative do you think there were inadequate safeguards there , or do you think this is just the risk we run when the government gets involved in subsidizing new industries and technologies \? gov perry well , i do n't think the federal government should be involved in that type of investment , period if states want to choose to do that , i think that s fine for states to do that ms tumulty and you have in texas done that with the emerging technology fund but your own state auditor said earlier this year that that fund is neither accountable nor transparent the dallas morning news reported that that fund gave 16 million to companies that are connected to your campaign contributors and like solyndra , some of the emerging technology fund investments have gone bust so how is this different in principle from the obama administration s efforts to pick winners in the future economy \? gov perry well , first off , the texas legislature has full oversight of that committee it s approved it for i think since 2003 so every two years the texas legislature looks at it and it s had full oversight , and i can promise you the 54 , 600 jobs that have been created and the 14plus billion dollars worth of investment that has come out of the enterprise fund in the state of texas , those people that have jobs today in the state of texas , they are absolutely happy that we 've got a program like that and and 75 percent of those emerging technology fund dollars or my appointees never made a contribution to me , period ms tumulty but you talk about you talk about oversight the fact is that in some instances your appointees have overruled the regional boards that have tried to turn back some of these deals gov perry every every one of those projects had the lieutenant governor , the speaker and the governor s office so there s extraordinary amount of oversight in those programs , and we 're proud of them i mean , we feel like that those are part of the reason that texas has led the nation in the creation of jobs while this country was losing 2 1 2 million jobs , texas was creating 1 million jobs that s the kind of leadership that america s longing for , someone that actually understands that you have to be able to give a climate where people know they can risk their capital and have a chance to have a return on that investment mr rose we have one more video i want to show here it is former president george w bush \( from videotape \) the more people who own their home , the better off america is and we 're making good progress our nation s 68 percent homeownership rate is the highest ever more people own homes now than ever before in the country s history , and that s exciting for the future of america \( applause \) mr rose speaker gingrich , is the american dream of owning a home no longer a realistic dream \? and is it too easy in america \? mr gingrich you know , there s a stream of american thought that really wishes we would decay and fall apart , and that the future would be bleak so the government could then share the misery it was captured by jimmy carter in his malaise speech it s captured every week by barack obama in his apologias disguised as press conferences \( laughter , scattered applause \) the fact is and the governor is exactly right when we get back i mean , a lot of these folks are right about a lot of things his energy plan , his industrial manufacturing plan , most of what he put down a fair amount , but not totally what my good friend said there hard money with a very limited federal reserve ms tumulty \( \? \) repeal obamacare mr gingrich what huntsman has done ms tumulty \( \? \) repeal obamacare mr gingrich and she she s right on repealing doddfrank i'm shocked that the house republicans have n't repealed doddfrank they ought to do it now ms tumulty \( off mic \) mr gingrich they ought to repeal sarbanesoxley now if we get back on track , the and you know this , as a former ambassador the chinese could n't compete with us in a hundred years if we got our act together in this country and we got back to doing the right things in this country at which point we could afford to buy houses , which would solve virtually everything else you got to be able to afford it to be able to buy it , and that s where things went wrong in the in the last decade mr rose all right julianna ms goldman mr cain \( applause \) you recently said , quoting you do n't blame wall street , do n't blame the big banks if you do n't have a job and you 're not rich , blame yourself so are you telling the 14 million unemployed americans that it s their fault that they do n't have a job \? mr cain no , the question was that response was directed at the people that are protesting on wall street , not that 14 million people who are out of work for no reason of their own other than that the economy is not growing , not the millions of people that are underemployed that statement was not directed at them it was specifically directed at the people who were protesting on wall street and i also said that they have basically targeted the wrong target it should be against the failed policies of this administration , not wall street , is where they should be protesting ms goldman governor romney , i want to ask you , because president obama s jobs bill was stalled in the senate today , and so it may have to be broken into component parts for congress to vote on if the payroll tax cut is not extended , that would mean a tax increase for all americans what would be the consequences of that \? mr romney no one likes to see tax increases , but look , the the stimulus bills the president comes out with that are supposedly going to create jobs , we 've now seen this played in the theater several times and what we 're seeing has n't worked the american people know that when he when he went into office and borrowed 800 billion for a massive jobs stimulus program , that they did n't see the jobs some of those green jobs we were supposed to get , that s money down the drain the right course for america is not to keep spending money on stimulus bills , but instead to make permanent changes to the tax code look , when you give as the president s bill does , if you give a temporary change to the payroll tax and you say , we 're going to extend this for a year or two , employers do n't hire people for a year or two they make an investment in a person that goes over a long period of time and so if you want to get this economy going again , you have to have people who understand how employers think , what it takes to create jobs and what it takes to create jobs is more than just a temporary shift in a tax stimulus it needs instead fundamental restructuring of our economy to make sure that we are the most attractive place in the world for investment , for innovation , for growth and for hiring , and we can do that again ms goldman so you would be ok with seeing the payroll tax cuts mr romney look , i do n't like \( inaudible \) little band aids i want to fundamentally restructure america s foundation economically mr rose before a closing question , i want not this hour and a half to pass without some recognition and conversation about the question of disparity in america karen ms tumulty governor perry , over the last 30 years , the income of the wealthiest 1 percent of americans has grown by more than 300 percent and yet , we have more people living in poverty in this country than at any time in the last 50 years is this acceptable \? and what would you do to close that gap \? gov perry the reason we have that many people living in poverty is because we 've got a president of the united states who s a job killer that s what s wrong with this country today you have a president who does not understand how to create wealth he has overtaxed , overregulated the smallbusinessmen and women to the point where they 're laying off people twoandahalf million americans are out there who have lost their jobs we have 14 million without work this president , i will suggest to you , is the biggest deterrent to getting this country back on track and we have to do everything we can to replace barack obama in 2012 \( applause \) mr rose all right , let me just mr santorum there s more there s more to it mr rose ok , but we 're almost out of time i want to give you a chance , and then we have to go to a final question mr santorum there s more to it than that i agree with rick , what he said but the biggest problem with poverty in america we do n't talk about here , because it s an economic discussion and that is the breakdown of the american family you want to look at the poverty rate among families that have two a husband and wife working in them \? it s 5 percent today a family that s headed by one person \? it s 30 percent today we need to do something we need to talk about economics , the home the word home in greek is the basis of the word economy it is it is the foundation of our country we need to have a policy that supports families , that encourages marriage mr rose all right mr santorum that has fathers take responsibility for their children you ca n't have limited government , you ca n't have a wealthy society , if the family breaks down that basic unit of society and that needs to be included in this economic discussion mr rose all right , i 've got one last question one last question with 30 minutes of one last question audience member \( off mic \) mr rose all right one last question as we close this evening , and each of you 30 seconds what is it about you that you want to connect with the american people in their both despair and in their hope for the future that says something essentially about who you are \? and i begin with congresswoman bachmann rep bachmann i'm sorry , charlie rep paul \( chuckles \) a little distraction \( laughter \) mr rose it is about the individual we have 30 seconds here we 've talked about issues here , but i want to talk for a moment , as a last impression , a sense of what it is about you that you want to hear and let the american people know about you and your sense of recognizing their own pain as well as their hope \? rep bachmann well , i do i grew up in a middleclass home we went to below mr rose thirty seconds i'm sorry rep bachmann we we went to below poverty when my parents divorced , and my mother worked very hard we all did we all got jobs and we were able to work our way through college and and eventually my husband and i started a business we have broken hearts for atrisk kids , charlie that s why we took 23 foster children into our home i believe the best solutions are the ones closest to home if we reach out as individuals to help people and have broken hearts for people and care for them on a personal basis , then we do n't need big government to step in and do that job the more that we can do to love people , the better off the society will be mr rose and herman cain thirty seconds mr cain i can connect with people s pain because i was po' before i was poor my dad worked three jobs i understand what that means but more importantly , with my career and with my record , i understand that leaders are supposed to make sure we 're working on the right problems , we assign the right priority surround yourself with the right people , which will allow you to put together the right plans and yes , sometimes those plans will be bold plans , because this economy is on life support we do n't need to trim around the edges we need a bold plan mr rose congressman speaker gingrich mr gingrich well , look , i grew up in an army brat family we moved all over the country in recent years i 've had relatives out of work i 've had folks who were trying to find jobs for up to a year we have , i think , a pretty good sense of the pain level but i also think it s important to say of leaders that you find solution i do n't think people hire one of us just to say i sympathize with you i think they hire us to say this is how we will solve it and i would say every person at this table is more likely to solve those problems than barack obama mr rose congressman paul \( applause \) rep paul my motivation , my goals has always been to promote liberty , believing that s what made america great if we want prosperity , if we want peace , we understand what the cause of liberty is all about and we have to understand that a free market system and sound money gives us the prosperity and it also is the humanitarian program , because once you get into the welfare state and a socialist state , it all backfires so if you care about people , you believe in liberty , that s what made america great that s what i want to restore mr rose senator santorum \( applause \) mr santorum as was mentioned , i grew up in a steel town , and one of the things that i realized is the when manufacturing left , a lot of the people in the middle income of america left and what we what i i just read a recent study that actually income mobility from the bottom two quintiles up into the middle of up into the middle income is actually greater the mobility in europe than it is in america today we need to change that , and the way you do it is by in by creating jobs in the manufacturing sector of the economy , which is what i will do it create that income mobility it 'll create the opportunity for semiskilled and lower skilled and and skilled workers to rise in society it will take those people off of occupy and bring them into the workplace , where they can they can have familysustaining jobs mr rose governor huntsman mr huntsman not only have i seen and participated in the creation of a great family business where jobs mean something , but i presided over a state that delivered the lowest level of unemployment in this country , 24 percent and when i saw on the faces of people who had the dignity of a job , you knew what it meant to moms and dads and entire families and when sheriff hardy who was here in hillsborough , new hampshire , when he talks about his deputies who for the first time are handing our foreclosure notices to the middle class and they 're seeing a rise in suicides , they 're seeing a rise in spousal abuse , they 're seeing a rise in substance abuse , it gives you a sense of what it means to have the dignity of a job we do n't have enough of them in this country mr rose governor perry gov perry charlie , as the son of tenant farmers and a young man who had the opportunity to wear the uniform of my country , and then the great privilege to serve as the governor of the second largest state in this country , i 've got not only the ceo experience but also working with the private sector to create the jobs and that s what people are begging for talking to that outofwork rig worker out in the gulf of mexico today , they 're begging for someone to make america america again mr rose governor romney mr romney you know , we talked about a crisis this evening , an economic crisis , people out of work , incomes going down but there s another crisis , and that s that people wonder whether their future will be brighter for the kids than it s been for them it s always been what it means to be american , to have a greater degree of confidence in the future than even what we 've enjoyed ourselves and what we have to do is to have the leadership in this country , like the men and women at this table , who believe in america my experience will help us get our values strong , get our economy strong , and make sure that our military is second to none in the world i am absolutely devoted to making america the strongest nation on earth and if you do n't want that as your objective , do n't vote for me we already have a president that does n't make that his first first objective mr rose all right i want to thank each and all of the candidates who sat at this table this evening as i said at the beginning , i believe in tables and i believe that places where you can come and talk about the country and its future and your beliefs is important secondly , i want to thank karen and thank julianna for joining us i want to thank all of you who came here this evening to hear these candidates thank you very much for those at home , thank you for watching a postdebate program will follow this we thank you for your time good night \( applause \) end
i see some commenters reacting to the failure of major inflation to break out by insisting that inflation is defined as an increase in the monetary base that is , the bank reserves plus currency that are what increases when the fed prints money as it happens , that s wrong very old dictionaries defined inflation as a rise in money and or credit , but the modern usage is , of course , a rise in prices but that s really a side issue nobody would care about the size of the monetary base except for the belief that increasing the base leads to a rise in prices that s not a question of definitions , it s a question of your model of the economy the underlying belief of all the people accusing ben bernanke of doing something dastardly is that printing money has caused or will cause high inflation in the ordinary sense the thing is , of course , that the past three years the postlehman era during which the fed presided over a tripling of the monetary base have been an excellent test of that model , which has failed with flying colors here are the data i ve included commodity prices \( imf index \) as well as consumer prices for the people who believe that the bls is hiding true inflation \( which it isn t \) a couple of notes for the commodity prices it matters which month you start , because they dropped sharply between august and september 2008 i use the imf index for convenience easy to download \( thomson reuters i use when i just want to snatch a picture from bloomberg \) but none of this should matter when you triple the monetary base , the resulting inflation shouldn t be something that depends on the fine details unless the model is completely wrong and the model is completely wrong you don t get more conclusive tests than this in economics by contrast , the model of an economy in a liquidity trap , in which big increases in the monetary base don t matter , comes through just fine and this in turn tells you something about the people pushing this stuff they had a model it made predictions the predictions were utterly , totally wrong and they have just dug in further
with several republican candidates struggling in the nomination race and no chris christie or mitch daniels to save them , those underwhelmed by the current field have instead turned their attention toward the one who already dropped out gov tim pawlenty of minnesota the new republic s isaac chotiner suggests that mr pawlenty made a major error by dropping out of the campaign and would have had a good chance to win the nomination the american prospect s jamelle bouie goes one step further and says mr pawlenty could be winning right now jonathan bernstein , on the other hand , thinks that mr pawlenty read the writing on the wall correctly and had already essentially lost my position is somewhere between mr bernstein s and mr chotiner s i think there is a scenario under which mr pawlenty could have won the nomination but i don t think it is was a particularly likely one and i certainly don t think he d be leading in the polls right now mr chotiner notes , and it has become commonplace to say , that several different republican candidates have surged over the course of the cycle , seeing sudden and sharp increases in their polling isn t it likely that mr pawlenty would have surged as well \? \( for convenience , we ll refer to this hypothesis as surge theory \) i doubt it there are a couple of problems with surge theory one of surge theory s major conceits is that this sort of thing happens all the time a candidate enters the race , shoots up to 20 percent in the polls overnight and then is back down to 6 percent the next day but in fact , this has not been common historically candidates usually do see some improvement in the polls when they enter a race , but it is generally modest usually 2 or 3 points and may simply reflect favorable press coverage and improved name recognition nor has there been any particular tendency for these bounces to fade a candidate s polls are as likely to continue moving upward from that point as to fall back down instead , that fact that we ve had several different surgers this cycle 10 different actual or potential republican candidates have led at least one poll since the start of the year is quite unusual you can draw a weak parallel to the 2004 democratic race , when eight different candidates led at some point in the cycle and both howard dean and wesley clark experienced fairly dramatic increases in their polling but mr dean and mr clark s numbers did not really fade until just a week or two before the actual voting began that is quite common lots of volatility in the several weeks before , and the several weeks after , iowa and new hampshire it is not at all common , however , to see such dramatic movement so early in the campaign you can cite an example like fred thompson , but you ll run out of them pretty quickly after that the second problem with surge theory is that it lumps different candidates together on the basis of what happened in their polling , while missing a potentially deeper connection between them the surgers are usually described as being donald trump , michele bachmann , rick perry and herman cain we have a slightly different story in each case donald trump was never a candidate for president , and his surge in the polls was extremely shortlived i would suggest it belonged more in the category of a noneoftheabove or notyetsure choice , as sometimes happens when a pollster inserts a wellknown name in the middle of a bunch of obscure ones in the past , pollsters have sometimes included the names of wellknown businessmen \( lee iacocca \) or former nominees \( gerald ford \) or people who have no interest in running \( colin powell \) or independent politicians \( ross perot as a republican \) into primary polls sometimes they do pretty well , but voters may simply be picking out the name they know the best rather than considering them in the context of being actual candidates the moment it seemed even slightly plausible that mr trump would actually run , his numbers dropped off a cliff michele bachmann s surge was not quite as dramatic as the others , and her fade was gradual rather than sudden it is pretty well explained by fundamental factors mrs bachmann entered the race with a boffo performance in a debate , had a natural base of sarah palin supporters to draw from and then faded once a candidate \( rick perry \) with as much tea party credibility but more traditional credentials and stronger campaigning skills entered instead as for rick perry himself , i think there s a lot of hindsight bias in implying there was anything so certain about the decline in his polling there has been some tendency historically for candidates who entered the race late to see their numbers decline after their announcements , but we re talking a 2 or 3point drop in the polls on average and not anything like the 20point decline mr perry has experienced \( such dramatic declines have rarely happened unless there was some monkey business involved \) mr perry s problems , instead , can be linked to his abysmal performance in the republican debates finally we have herman cain , who is a phenomenon unto himself and one without any good precedent at all unlike the other candidates , his surge came only after several months of campaigning unlike the others , it came despite initially very weak name recognition and unlike the others , mr cain s surge in the polls has not yet faded although we ll see how he endures his rough week  basically , i think surge theory errs by lumping four separate and distinct cases into one there are some parallels between mr perry s surge and mrs bachmann s but mr cain s and mr trump s were different sorts of phenomena except for one thing all of these candidates , with the partial exception of mr perry , are antiestablishment candidates they are not considered acceptable choices at all by republican elites the lack of elite support may be some of the reason that they faded in the polls \( for the record , i am persuaded that elite support matters , i m just not sure that it can t ever be outweighed by other factors \) but perhaps also , the lack of elite support explains why these candidates rose in the polls in the first place the republican establishment is not very popular right now even among republicans republicans perceive it as having delivered a failed candidate in john mccain , and having been complicit in unpopular things like the iraq war , rising deficits and the federal bailouts some republicans , even some staunch conservatives , also do not think highly of george w bush , perhaps the republican establishment s most recent real success the tea party movement that helped to revitalize conservatives in 2010 was a reaction to much of this tim pawlenty was never going to pass for an antiestablishment candidate not when he had been in elected office since 1993 , not when he had more support among pundits than he seemed to have among voters , and not when his personality and his campaign were so cautious and predictable but he sometimes tried to run as one , particularly late in the race when he frequently went toe to toe with mrs bachmann mr pawlenty also had problems as an establishment candidate especially his poor fundraising numbers , which as much as anything explained why he ended his campaign but mr pawlenty might have had a chance to win that way this would have involved taking the side of the bet that what republicans really are looking for an alternative to mitt romney and mitt romney in particular mr pawlenty would have run as an explicitly antiromney but implicitly proestablishment candidate i don t know that i buy this theory it seems at least as likely that the reason no credible establishment alternative has emerged to mr romney is that having the establishment s support is a bug rather than a feature for many republican voters and is therefore mr romney s foremost flaw as well as his biggest advantage that is , being the antiromney candidate is tantamount to being an antiestablishment candidate hence , efforts by the establishment to seek an alternative to mr romney are doomed to fail but the other case is certainly plausible republicans bypassed mr romney in 2008 for another candidate with establishment support and the bet on it would have been worth mr pawlenty s time and effort had he the money to make it \( or had he not blown his chance during the saint anselm debate \) this scenario , though mr pawlenty making no pretense of being anything other than a traditional establishment candidate who would run a traditional establishment campaign would have involved a traditional path toward victory winning iowa , then hoping for the best it would probably not have involved a highly novel concept like surge theory
when kathy nickolaus , the county clerk in waukesha county , wisconsin , spoke to the press on thursday after revealing that she had failed to count more than 14 , 000 ballots in the hotly contested state supreme court election , one might have expected her to offer her resignation instead , ms nickolaus blamed human error for the problem , which resulted in the failure to tally any votes from the city of brookfield , which accounts for about 11 percent of her county s voters most of the 14 , 315 uncounted votes were cast for the more conservative candidate , david prosser as a result , mr prosser who had been about 200 ballots behind joanne kloppenburg in a contest that seemed bound for a recount had a net gain of more than 7 , 500 votes , and now has an overall lead of about that size although the election may still go to a recount , it is now highly unlikely that the outcome will change , unless another county discovers a discrepancy of the same magnitude , but in ms kloppenburg s favor the human who made the error was none other than ms nickolaus , who said she had failed to save a computer file after entering brookfield s results it is hard to excuse the mistake , which was of a considerably larger magnitude than anything that happened in an individual county during the controversial recounts in florida or minnesota there are , of course , suggestions in some liberalleaning blogs that ms nickolaus \( who has worked for republicans in the past \) is attempting to steal the election but a look at the turnout estimates in waukesha county , before and after the problem was corrected , suggest that her mistake was probably an honest one the original turnout figure was somewhat lower than what might have been expected statistically , and the revised one is more in line with reasonable expectations in the gubernatorial election in 2010 , waukesha county , a republican stronghold , had the highest turnout among the 72 counties in wisconsin of its 261 , 405 registered voters , 188 , 278 , or 72 percent , cast a legal ballot in that race , well above wisconsin s statewide turnout of 62 percent the county also had aboveaverage turnout in the primary in february , in which mr prosser , the incumbent , and ms kloppenburg won the two spots on the generalelection ballot in a fourcandidate contest the county s turnout in the primary was 14 percent , compared with the state average of 12 percent the same holds true for the presidential race of 2008 , when 89 percent of the county s registered voters cast ballots , compared with 86 percent for wisconsin as a whole by contrast , when waukesha county s results in the judicial election were first announced results on tuesday night , the turnout appeared to have been 423 percent , slightly below the statewide average of 427 percent now , with the brookfield ballots included , the county s total is now 478 percent , more consistent with its past pattern of slightly exceeding the statewide figure each election is different , of course the fact that waukeshans voted at higherthanaverage rates in the past wouldn t guarantee anything this time around and this election was unusual a contest for a pivotal court seat , but also something of a confidence vote on gov scott walker , who has been engaged in a fierce battle with unions and their supporters and has seen his popularity wane in public opinion polls so it might be useful to look at turnout figures from other counties in wisconsin , whose figures \( as far as we know \) are reasonably sound here is a graphic , for instance , comparing turnout rates in last year s gubernatorial election with the judicial election on tuesday the red circle represents the originally reported figure for waukesha county , and the green circle its vote after the recanvassing the blue circles represent the other 71 counties in wisconsin as you can see , turnout in 2010 was a reasonably good predictor of the turnout this week based on 2010 , waukesha county s turnout should have been about 515 percent , plus or minus some margin of error its revised figure of 478 percent is closer to that expectation than the 423 percent figure originally reported we can also look at how turnout in the presidential election of 2008 compared with this week s election this model predicts that waukesha county s turnout ought to be about 446 percent , which is in between the original and revised figures note , however , that the data does not fit quite as well the results from the other counties are more spread out along the regression line what that means is that 2008 turnout did not predict this year s voting as well as 2010 turnout did though this evidence is more equivocal as to which turnout figure is the right one , it s also less salient to the question the same holds true for the february supreme court election here again , waukesha county s expected turnout falls between its original and revised figures but again the fit is not terribly strong , so this represents a rougher guess than we get from using the 2010 data a better way to think about this is in terms of a 95 percent confidence interval , or margin of error for instance , based on the 2010 data , we d estimate that waukesha county s turnout should have been 515 percent , plus or minus 78 percent , meaning that there was a 95 percent chance that the true figure was in the range of 437 percent to 593 percent the original turnout estimate , 423 percent , falls outside this range , meaning that we can be fairly confident that something unusual \( like failing to count an entire city s ballots \) had occurred true , if we attempt to forecast waukesha county s turnout based on the 2008 or february 2011 data instead , the original turnout figure falls well within the margin of error but so does the revised one , so this doesn t tell us anything especially interesting if one wanted to argue that waukesha county s turnout ought to have been moderate or low despite its having been aboveaverage in the past a reasonable justification might be that the county doesn t have very many unionized workers , and is dominated by whitecollar private businesses like general electric , which has a large complex there union workers , especially in the public sector , probably had the most at stake in the judicial election , since the winner is likely to be called on to rule on the controversial legislation that state republicans passed to roll back collective bargaining rights no data is available on unionization rates at the county level in wisconsin what we can look at , however , is the percentage of workers in each county who work in state or local government , about half of whom are unionized statewide this data is available in the census bureau s american community survey it turns out that about 75 percent of the employed population in waukesha county works for state or local government , as compared with 11 percent for wisconsin as a whole so far , the best predictor we ve found of turnout in this week s election is turnout in 2010 if we run a regression analysis and also include the share of state and local government employees as an explanatory variable , it does have a statistically significant effect \( provided that we weight the regression by the number of registered voters in each county \) however , this reduces the turnout prediction for waukesha only slightly , and the figure that was originally reported still falls outside the 95percent confidence interval the same holds true if we run a kitchen sink regression analysis that includes a couple of other variables that appear to have some predictive power , like the percentage of people who voted for governor walker in november and the percentage of voters who are white i m deliberately not going into very much detail on this analysis because it basically tells us the same story that the simpler approaches did there is no evidence that waukesha county s revised vote count is unusually high , whereas there is some evidence that its original vote count was unusually low this evidence is reasonably \( though not overwhelmingly \) convincing waukesha county s turnout rate was too low according to some versions of the model , but it was a modest outlier rather than an extraordinary one put differently , if there hadn t been some concrete reason to suspect that the original figure was off , i don t know that it would have raised any red flags from a statistical perspective nevertheless , if you want to allege that there s a conspiracy afoot , the statistical evidence tends to work against you waukesha county s revised turnout figures are pretty normal for waukesha county , a wealthy , white suburban county that usually votes at high rates , whereas its original figures were at the low end of reasonable expectations , given the way the rest of the state voted also of note is that the number of votes that ms nickolaus says she failed to count in brookfield , amounting to 11 percent of the county total , is in line with the proportion brookfield normally represents the city supplied 11 percent of waukesha county s total vote in both the 2008 and 2010 general elections if this was a conspiracy , it was one executed with an extraordinarily high degree of cunning and competence i m more inclined to think that ms nickolaus , who has drawn complaints for her sloppy management practices in the past , is no savvier than she seems if you re still not persuaded , you re welcome to play around with the data yourself , which you can download as an msexcel file here
terrence mcnally s 1995 play master class imagines what happens when the opera diva maria callas leads an emotional master class for several students at the juilliard school in the early 1970s the new broadway revival , which opened on thursday , stars tyne daly as callas \( zoe caldwell , who played the role in the original production , won a tony award \) in his review , ben brantley writes that mr mcnally s drama is not , by even a generous reckoning , a very good play , yet ms daly gives a remarkable performance that transforms the script into one of the most haunting portraits of life after stardom what did nytimescom readers think \? following are excerpts from selected online reviews  most readers focused their reviews on ms daly s performance those who liked it praised her for her ability to transform into a powerful diva who commands the stage and terrifies her students i ve crushed on ms daly since her turn as the tough young cop of the enforcer in 1976 , stayed with her over time and through different weights , and i would still hug her in my arms and kiss her after seeing her last night in master class funny moving chilling riveting , new york nothing prepared me for the magnitude of this accomplishment there has never been a better maria , never , except maybe the lady herself , new york well , here she is boys , here s callas fiery , funny , angry , she really gets it , and gets us too great supporting cast in a play by terrence mcnally that is even better than i remembered let s hope that tyne is not forgotten at tony time , as the new season is just beginning , but i don t expect to see a better performance all year , new york but a few people weren t totally convinced of ms daly s ability to believably channel callas tyne daly is a magnificent actress , but she is sadly miscast here many people mention the word broad when describing her past roles callas was not a broad tyne daly cannot quite capture the elegance and a certain class callas had , although from humble beginnings she was grand and certainly cultured , and we miss that in this impersonation , spain i was very disappointed this is a great play unfortunately ms daly was not up to the task i felt i was watching a cheap caricature of maria callas none of it seemed believable the supporting cast was equally mediocre , new york tyne daly is still wonderful she is , however , not believable nor authentic as the great maria callas she should have worked with a vocal coach and watched a million of callas s interviews to get the voice right because maria callas is all about the voice , whether speaking or singing , new york what did you think of master class \? post your review
amar'e stoudemire soars , and the hopes of every fan rise with him he is airborne for fractions of a second , but in the moment there is elation , anticipation , a breathless , palpable thrill as he flies toward the basket for eight years , the experienced the euphoria and all of the benefits that came with it emphatic dunks , 60win seasons , deep playoff runs , championship dreams then they let stoudemire leave last july , in spite of it all it was not about the soaring , but the landings the repeated pounding , the wear and the tear and the belief that eventually , perhaps in just two or three years , stoudemire s surgically repaired knees would wither under the strain that the highflying allstar would be grounded and rendered ordinary so when stoudemire asked for a fully guaranteed 100 million contract , the suns balked and bid farewell to one of the most riveting players in franchise history it was a remarkable , excruciating decision , made more painful over time stoudemire is now leading a knicks resurgence , while the suns are rapidly fading in the western conference there may be visible cringing at us airways center in phoenix on friday night , when stoudemire makes his first appearance as a knick it was sad , and it was disappointing , robert sarver , the suns' majority owner , said of the parting stoudemire , 28 , is playing at his peak , averaging 264 points , 9 rebounds and 23 blocks for the knicks but the suns saw a player who had six operations in eight years , none more worrisome than the left knee surgery he had in october 2005 stoudemire had microfracture surgery , a procedure designed to spur cartilage growth , providing a critical buffer between bones stoudemire s existing cartilage had become damaged and the knee had become painful although microfracture has been associated with the rapid decline of star players like penny hardaway , chris webber , allan houston and tracy mcgrady , stoudemire s prognosis was excellent he was 22 at the time , and the damage was minimal and in a nonweightbearing area indeed , stoudemire has thrived since the operation and has played in at least 79 games in three of the last four seasons \( his 20089 season was cut short by a detached retina \) by all appearances , he is in the clear suns officials were not so sure doctors advised them that the new cartilage might last for only six or seven years if it deteriorated , stoudemire s valued athleticism could go with it our best estimate was that we thought amar'e had two or three really good years left in him , said steve kerr , the former suns general manager , who now works as an analyst for tnt stoudemire is now five years removed from microfracture surgery year 7 would coincide with the 201112 season the second year of his fiveyear , 100 million contract with the knicks the suns offered stoudemire the same terms , but guaranteed only the first three years for the final two years to become guaranteed , stoudemire would have had to play 2 , 200 minutes in the third and fourth seasons \( an average of 268 minutes over 82 games \) it was n't based on performance , sarver said it was just based on health stoudemire opted for maximum security , signing a fully guaranteed deal with the knicks , who expressed no such concerns over his longterm viability did the knicks assume a tremendous risk \? is there an expiration date on stoudemire s left knee \? the answer is not entirely clear dr richard steadman , who pioneered the microfracture procedure in the 1980s , said his followup studies with patients who were , on average , 11 years removed from surgery had shown no decline in function in general , if the procedure s successful , the tissue remains resilient indefinitely , he said the patients in those studies were not nba players but steadman has performed the surgery on many athletes , including the denver nuggets' kenyon martin and the portland trail blazers' greg oden i think in general , if people have gone six years and there s no signs of slowing , they have a good chance of going indefinitely , steadman said yet there is some debate in orthopedic circles according to dr david altchek , the cochief of sports medicine and shoulder service at the hospital for special surgery , the scar cartilage created through microfracture surgery differs from normal cartilage the differences can be seen at the cell level when the tissue is examined under an electron microscope people have observed and hypothesized that this scar cartilage does not have the durability of normal cartilage and may in fact break down after five to seven years , altchek said altchek said he would not dismiss that view but in assessing microfracture s purported lifespan , he said i do n't think you can put an expiration date on it i think there s something in between it makes sense you 're not putting normal cartilage back in there without the benefit of an electron microscope , or a crystal ball , the suns deemed the risks to be too great the nba s insurance carrier has excluded stoudemire for careerending injuries to either knee \( the right one had arthroscopic surgery \) or his eye losing a player making 20 million a year would devastate the suns , who are privately owned the knicks , who have the backing of madison square garden , have a much greater margin for error the knicks' medical staff reviewed stoudemire s magnetic resonance imaging tests and consulted with outside experts , the team president donnie walsh said none of them indicated that stoudemire s knee might have only two years left walsh called that assertion suspect it helped , too , that stoudemire was renowned for his work ethic and his diligence when it came to training and diet we felt pretty good , walsh said look , there s not a player on the market today that when you get into years four and five that you 're not worried about it there is no ambiguity about the present the knicks , at 2014 , are having their best season in a decade the suns , who made the conference finals last spring , are 11th in the west at 1419 they have used four different starters at power forward , i really did n't understand what the future was there in phoenix if it did n't involve me , stoudemire said thursday the suns saved some money , and a lot of fretting over scar cartilage , mris and unhappy landings all it cost them was the thrill
the mayoral campaign provided drama again this week with the jerry springer showlike scene of s launching into an animated tirade directed at patricia van pelt watkins a longshot candidate and , until that moment , lowprofile rival in the feb 22 election the cementing of s residency and candidacy by the illinois supreme court could have ushered in discourse that at last would focus on the daunting issues facing whoever replaces richard m daley , chicago s longestserving mayor but the race , while still long on spectacle , remained short on specifics the sharply personal feud over what drugs ms watkins did or did not abuse decades ago was not the only sideshow that allowed the candidates to continue avoiding substantive discussion of arguably the most difficult and vital topic the city s dire financial picture at first glance , it might seem that gery chico , the former president of the city school board , broached a serious fiscal matter with his campaign s incessant email and news conferences about what mr chico dubbed the rahm tax on luxury services mr emanuel said the revenue generated by the tax would be offset by a reduction in the sales tax , while mr chico disputed that accounting in either case , the plan would barely factor into a city budget that is hundreds of millions of dollars out of balance every year the candidates for mayor have not yet explained what they think the city should do to prevent spending from continuing to far outstrip revenue none of them are offering any kind of plans to close that 600 million or 700 million gap , said alderman scott waguespack \( 32nd ward \) they are talking in terms of things that sound flashier and less about the ways they would actually come in and shake up the system , which would n't make them any friends aides to mr emanuel and mr chico say the candidates will soon present financial platforms for now , you can see how much detail they are willing to go into at there , you will find questionnaires that four of the candidates completed with their positions on city fiscal matters ms braun and william walls , a perennial candidate , were the only two mayoral hopefuls who did not return completed questionnaires although she has n't detailed it , ms braun said she also has a plan after accusing ms watkins of being strung out on crack a substance that ms watkins said she has never seen , much less smoked and before she ultimately said she was sorry , ms braun found time to defend her remarks at a live , instudio appearance on a tv news program this is a huge race , ms braun said this is about what we are we going to do to address the problems of the city of chicago i have a platform , i have a plan , i have a record , i have the experience to do the job , and that s what i would like to talk about for all of the candidates , time is running out

my column this week looks at the extraordinary efforts of times staffers as they responded to the news of osama bin laden s death in a raid by navy seals because the news broke late on print deadlines , the times took extraordinary measures to stop the presses , remake print pages and rush to get updated copies not only to new york readers but to many readers in major cities nationwide on top of that , the times mounted an intense global reporting effort aimed at delivering fresh stories through the night for publication on nytimescom , which became the key venue for breaking developments after the print edition closed at 12 45 am monday the result was an outpouring of fresh copy that was published onlineonly and then superseded eventually by new stories on monday , some of which ultimately fed a 10page special print section titled the death of bin laden that was delivered tuesday since my print column does not have additional space for displaying graphics , i ve included some images below to show how this transformation occurred rebooking the space in the front section of the new york times on short notice is no easy task but that s just what deputy director of news design brian fidelman was asked to do late into sunday evening mr fidelman returned to the office around 10 30 to help reallocate space to fit the additional news into the section without the addition of any extra pages moving all of the original stories off of a1 to make room for the four new bin laden stories , the news designers found space in the front section and in business to hold the original stories this was accomplished by removing ads , and in the case of elisabeth rosenthal s story on tilapia farming , shrinking the main photo that accompanied the article it seemed obvious to me , given the late hour , that as important and historic as our front page would be , the main platform for our coverage would be our web site , managing editor jill abramson told me by email i imagined that many people would get little sleep this night and would spend the predawn hours wanting to find great information that would help explain what had happened into the wee hours of monday morning , the times newsroom staff was thinking about a new way to present this breaking news we decided that we needed to move to an even bigger presentation , given the importance of the news , jonathan ellis , assistant editor for digital platforms told my assistant joseph burgess we do have several different home page templates , which allow us to lay out our big news packages in different ways smaller photos , bigger photos , banner headlines , no banner headlines , etc however , we determined that none of our available home page templates provided the emphasis this story deserved thus , we made the decision to go to a customized layout , outside of what our templates are designed for this customized layout seen above would make the bin laden package even wider on the page than usual , expanding into the area usually occupied by opinion content and pushing the opinion content over into the area usually occupied by our facebook module a few weeks before , one of our home page producers , ariane bernard , had presciently been working on such a customized layout just in case a huge news story were to occur but since this was not a standard template , this customized layout required a lot of work with the page s html code , and all of the kinks were not worked out we were unable to roll out the bigger layout as soon as we would have liked fortunately , a number of producers and editors , including hamilton boardman , seth carlson and nathan ashbykuhlman , either rushed into the office or worked from home on this and it was this level of dedication , from the editors , reporters and producers working from the newsroom and their homes in new york , coupled with the efforts of times staffers working from washington and around the globe , that made this a special and memorable night for the times
andy benoit is previewing all 32 nfl teams this week , he is analyzing the afc south last year , there was an unofficial national movement to declare the indianapolis colts old people looked only at the unusually lengthy list of injuries striking this team and chalked it up to father time never mind that all of the key players who missed significant time tight end dallas clark , running back joseph addai , wide receivers austin collie and anthony gonzalez , safety melvin bullitt , linebacker clint session and cornerbacks jerraud powers and kelvin hayden were all , save for clark , under 30 years old in truth , time is closing in on this team but it s closing in on everybody and , with 31yearolds dwight freeney and gary brackett being the defensive elder statesmen but still firmly in their primes , it s fair to say that father time is chasing only the offense clark is 32 so are reggie wayne and right tackle ryan diem the esteemed center jeff saturday is 36 and that guy who takes the snaps from saturday is 35 we can stop right here really , if father time wants to take down this franchise , he need only sack peyton manning as 31 nfl teams can attest , that s not easy but for the first time in 14 years , it doesn t seem impossible manning spent virtually the entire offseason recovering from a second neck operation to correct a bulging disk he originally said he wouldn t have even had the surgery if the lockout hadn t wiped out offseason team activities but with nearly three months now gone by and manning still not practicing \( which is akin to you or i not eating or sleeping \) , our antennas of suspicion are effectively raised still , this summer , the colts owner jim irsay followed through on his mission to resign manning long term and make him the highestpaid player in the nfl or he tried , anyway manning threw the organization a bone by signing on for five years at 90 million \( 69 million the first over three years \) , which is a few hairs below his market value that s a considerable investment in a 35yearold quarterback , but no one batted an eye , as it s common knowledge that irsay didn t have a choice the colts organization can replace coach tony dungy with jim caldwell and not skip a beat it can endure significant player personnel moves like replacing , say , the superb marvin harrison with an unknown like pierre garcon it can cycle through defensive personnel without much hiccup it can stand to lose a longtime offensive assistant like tom moore \( who left his consultant post and has now been completely replaced by the offensive coordinator clyde christensen \) it can even handle a passing of the torch from the team president bill polian to his son chris polian without drifting from the blueprint that has led to seven afc south titles in eight years \( we assume it can handle this , anyway it s early in that transition , but so far so good \) but what this organization cannot survive is a change under center the colts can survive all those other changes only because of who s under center lose manning and that s it era over so long , thanks for the memories it was fun all the best ! oh , and by the way , just a heads up you ll probably be remembered as football s version of the atlanta braves the 90s braves , that is nothing personal or too pejorative , really just , you know , the consistent regular season dominance and lone world title this is what the colts are fighting from here on out there is still plenty of time but yes , the clock s also ticking offense we re not going to bother analyzing what this offense might be like if dan orlovsky or \( colts fans , cover your ears \) curtis painter has to run the show for a little while just know it wouldn t be good as for peyton manning running the show , there is no arguing against his magnificence there was once a time when people questioned whether the presnap gyrations and neurotic preparation and attention to detail robbed this offense of its flexibility and personality but that was many mvps and several 4 , 000yard seasons ago the remaining scrap of doubters were hushed last season , when manning posted career highs in yards and pass attempts to prove once and for all that he can carry this unit no matter which 10 guys line up with him this year shouldn t be as challenging dallas clark is back posing matchup problems off the line of scrimmage or out of the slot and it s now known that his backup , jacob tamme , has the fluidity and soft hands to beat linebackers underneath and even the occasional safety down the seams tamme isn t a good inline blocker , though , so don t be surprised if the colts use the more physical brody eldridge in their base twotightend sets at receiver , everyone is praying austin collie , victim of at least two nasty concussions late last fall , can stay safe for 16 games the colts would not put him back in the slot if they did not trust doctors who say he s fine collie has a good feel for seeing what manning sees , which is what sets him apart from blair white if collie is unavailable , the quicker anthony gonzalez \( barring one of his regularly occurring injuries \) will get another opportunity to fulfill his firstround promise starting outside receiver pierre garcon is one of the physically strongest catchandrun weapons in the nfl the colts will need a breakout season from garcon , a fourthyear pro , because , with the exception of center jeff saturday , none of their older veterans have shown as stark a decline as reggie wayne this may sound preposterous considering wayne is coming off a 111catch , 1 , 355yard season but in an offense as proficient as this , the numbers will always be there \( especially when your quarterback attempts 679 passes \) what s more important is how those numbers are obtained are they coming against double teams and coverages tilted his direction over the top \? or are they against a lot of soft zones , where a receiver can get by on timing and precision \? this is not a rhetorical question there s an answer zones wayne can still feast on zones but in a private moment with all walls down , the colts brass would probably tell you that wayne is no longer explosive enough to consistently separate against quality man coverage \( which may be why he has not received the longterm contract he desires \) we ve seen the colts succeed without an effective ground game before , but they would make life easier on themselves \( and perhaps a little longer for manning \) if they had one most of indy s rushing production comes from manning audibling against a sevenman front but in shortyardage situations , the futility of this front five , and specifically the painfully weak interior three , gets exposed saturday is strictly a movementoriented player at this point he can t win many power battles the secondyear left guard jacques mcclendon is an unknown it would be sensible for the secondround rookie ben ijalana , a gifted 317pound right tackle at villanova , to start inside ahead of the hardworking but overwhelmed mike pollak but the colts insist that ijalana is strictly a tackle \( and thus , relegated to backup duty for now \) too bad he would most likely be an upgrade over recent years fillin starters kyle devan and jamey richard  it s a matter of time before the firstround rookie anthony castonzo starts ahead of the unqualified jeff linkenbach at left tackle the longarmed ryan diem is still one of the league s best right tackles but not quite the force he was a few years ago \( hence the ijalana pick \) fortunately , manning is decisive in the pocket and does not need firstclass blocking \( defenses don t even bother gameplanning to sack him they focus only on making him move his feet before throwing something he s not always comfortable doing \) running back joseph addai , and especially the hesitant firstround bust donald brown , however , do need firstclass blocking addai has unusual lateral acceleration that allows him to create his own wiggle room , but usually not until he breaks the line of scrimmage because he is a fervid passblocker and brown a mechanical runner who is perhaps less effective than even the undrafted thirdstringer javarris james , indy would probably love to ride the 28yearold addai as a threedown back in 2011 problem is , he has never shown that kind of durability , which is why the colts will probably use the fourthround rookie delone carter  defense it wouldn t be a gargantuan stretch to say that dwight freeney is as important to indianapolis s defense as manning is to indianapolis s offense this statement , though , held more water before the thirdyear defensive coordinator larry coyer s arrival , when this defense ran almost strictly zone schemes that relied on a straight fourman rush to be clear , this is still a finesse unit built to take advantage of the fast lucas oil surface but coyer has incorporated more interior blitzes and eightman run fronts into the early down packages , saving the club s hallmark tampa 2 concepts predominantly for long passing situations \( which is really how the passive zone defense is meant to be played these days \) that said , take away freeney \( who , as of right now , is the best pure speed rusher and best pure bull rusher in the nfl \) and the highspeed fumbleforcing machine robert mathis , and this defense would be hurting the polians know their ends are essential to almost everything their defense does that s why they drafted 255pound jerry hughes in the first round last year \( they may regret this pick , too , considering hughes made about as much impact on this team last season as danica patrick \) the absence of offseason team activities prevented the coaching staff from getting a good look at the thirdround rookie drake nevis and whatever undrafted gems they probably would have uncovered \( indy always find one or two \) thus , to augment depth along the defensive front , the colts took the unusual step \( for them \) of signing the free agents jamaal anderson and tommie harris although disappointing as a firstrounder in atlanta , anderson is a premier runstopping end who can offer 15 quality snaps a game harris can do the same as an explosive interior pass rusher it is apparent , though , that his longailing knee will not allow him to recapture his everydown allpro form because of this , the underappreciated and energetic 26yearolds fili moala , eric foster and antonio johnson will handle a bulk of the work at defensive tackle the colts fastflowing style against the run can lead to stops on the outside but also open the door to plenty of 7 and 8yard gashes in this scheme , the strong safety is often counted on to allay these gashes if healthy , melvin bullitt is up to task while no bob sanders , bullitt , a undrafted fifthyear pro , is one of the fastest run attackers in football he benefits from operating alongside a free safety with superb runpass recognition in antoine bethea instincts and familiarity allow bethea to play with much better range than his fairly ordinary athleticism suggests he should as important as bullitt and bethea are in the box , stopping the run still comes down to middle linebacker gary brackett and his two outside mates last year s secondround pick , pat angerer , has the recognition skills and physicality to be a longterm cog on the strong side he has a tad more speed than you would guess but is still not fast enough to play will linebacker in this scheme but last year s seventhrounder , kavell conner , may have the requisite speed conner , a supple athlete who sees the field fairly well , will get a chance to work ahead of the utility backup phillip wheeler the colts also signed the free agent ernie sims , but he gets lost in coverage and probably will not earn the trust of the linebackers coach mike murphy  as for the rest of the coverage , the thirdyear pros jerraud powers and jacob lacey will be asked to headline a razorthin cornerbacking group powers is a physical underneath defender but does not have the quickness to regularly make big plays lacey is similar , only less assertive when the ball is in the air on most teams , lacey would be a fringe nickel back but most teams don t have guys like the utterly untested kevin thomas \( missed all of his 2010 rookie season with a knee injury \) or the special teams veteran justin tryon vying for serious snaps special teams adam vinatieri is pretty good in the clutch you know punter pat mcafee is good if he can get arrested for public intoxication during the season and still remain part of this familyvalues organization this year he may get a chance at kicking longdistance field goals the colts return games have always been one of the most boring things in professional football right up there with the fullback handoff and halftime interviews because of this , we will no longer bother listing their return guys names \( they change from week to week anyway \) bottom line put em down for at least 10 wins and , more likely , 12 or 13 it is surprisingly easy to forget , but the last time this team stayed healthy , it started 140 and reached the super bowl the lockout figures to favor clubs that have built familiar , successful systems over the years thus , the question is is this system familiar enough to operate without manning having practiced in it for six months \? predicted finish 1st afc south andy benoit is the founder of and covers the nfl for he can be reached at andybenoit

tripoli , libya in the emerging postqaddafi libya , the most influential politician may well be , who has no formal title but commands broad respect as an islamic scholar and populist orator who was instrumental in leading the mass uprising the most powerful military leader is now the former leader of a hardline group once believed to be aligned with al qaeda the growing influence of islamists in libya raises hard questions about the ultimate character of the government and society that will rise in place of col muammar elqaddafi s autocracy the united states and libya s new leaders say the islamists , a wellorganized group in a mostly moderate country , are sending signals that they are dedicated to democratic pluralism they say there is no reason to doubt the islamists' sincerity but as in egypt and tunisia , the latest upheaval of the arab spring deposed a dictator who had suppressed hardcore islamists , and there are some worrisome signs about what kind of government will follow it is far from clear where libya will end up on a spectrum of possibilities that range from the turkish model of democratic pluralism to the muddle of egypt to , in the worst case , the theocracy of shiite iran or sunni models like the taliban or even al qaeda islamist militias in libya receive weapons and financing directly from foreign benefactors like qatar a muslim brotherhood figure , abel alrajazk abu hajar , leads the tripoli municipal governing council , where islamists are reportedly in the majority in eastern libya , there has been in july of the leader of the rebel military , gen abdul fattah younes , suspected by some to be the work of islamists mr belhaj has become so much an insider lately that he is seeking to unseat , the americantrained economist who is the nominal prime minister of the interim government , after mr jibril obliquely criticized the islamists for an uprising that presented a liberal , westernized face to the world , the growing sway of islamists activists with fundamentalist islamic views , who want a society governed by islamic principles is being followed closely by the united states and its nato allies i think it s something that everybody is watching , said , assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , visiting here on wednesday first of all the libyan people themselves are talking about this the highestranking american official to visit libya since colonel qaddafi s fall , mr feltman was optimistic that libya would take a moderate path based on our discussions with libyans so far , he said , we are n't concerned that one group is going to be able to dominate the aftermath of what has been a shared struggle by the libyan people mr sallabi , in an interview , made it clear that he and his followers wanted to build a political party based on islamic principles that would come to power through democratic elections but if the party failed to attract widespread support , he said , so be it it is the people s revolution , and all the people are muslims , islamists , mr sallabi said secularists are our brothers and they are libyans they have the right to offer their proposals and programs , he said , and if the libyan people choose them i have no problem we believe in democracy and the peaceful exchange of power many libyans say they are not worried the islamists are organized so they seem more influential than their real weight , said usama endar , a management consultant who was among the wealthy tripolitans who helped finance the revolution they do n't have wide support , and when the dust settles , only those with largescale appeal , without the tunnel vision of the islamists , will win yet an antiislamist , antisallabi rally in martyrs' square on wednesday drew only a few dozen demonstrators many , like aref nayed , coordinator of the transitional national council s stabilization team and a prominent religious scholar , say that the revolution had proved that libyans would not accept anything but a democratic society , and that the islamists would have to adapt to that there will be attempts by people to take over , but none of them will succeed because the young people will go out on the streets and bring them down , mr nayed said some are concerned that the islamists are already wielding too much power , particularly in relation to their support in libyan society , where most people , while devout , practice a moderate form of islam in which individual liberties are respected mr sallabi dismissed those fears , saying islamists would not impose their traditionalist views on others if people choose a woman to lead , as president , we have no problem with that women can dress the way they like they are free adel alhadi almishrogi , a prominent businessman who began raising money for the antiqaddafi insurgents early in the revolution , is not convinced by the islamists' declarations of fealty to democratic principles he pointed to a wellorganized islamist umbrella group , etilaf , which he said had pushed aside more secular groupings most libyans are not strongly islamic , but the islamists are strongly organized , and that s the problem , mr mishrogi said our meetings go on for hours without decisions their meetings are disciplined and right to the point they 're not very popular , but they 're organized he complains that etilaf and mr sallabi are the ones who are really running things in libya now others say the picture is much more diverse and chaotic than mr mishrogi suggests , although it is true that etilaf , with no fixed address and still apparently operating underground , continues to issue decrees of all sorts as if it were some sort of revolutionary guide all offices here must make sure that they are headed by an acceptable person within seven days of this notice , read a leaflet pasted to the doors of offices throughout tripoli central hospital , dated sept 3 and signed , simply , etilaf they are behind everything , mr mishrogi said youssef m sherif , a prominent libyan writer and intellectual , said every day the islamists grow stronger when there is a parliament , the islamists will get the majority abdel hakim belhaj is in effect the governor of tripoli just because he was elected by an islamist militia , mr sherif said echoing debates in egypt , mr sherif argued for a longer transition to elections than the planned eight months , to give liberals a better chance to organize the growing influence of the islamists is reflected in their increased willingness to play a political role until recently the islamists have kept a low profile , and even many secular libyan officials have expressed a reluctance to criticize them , saying they should focus instead on the common enemy while colonel qaddafi remains on the loose that seems to be changing after the interim government s acting prime minister , mr jibril , appeared recently in tripoli and indirectly as premature with a war still in progress , mr belhaj and mr sallabi began agitating for his replacement jibril will be gone soon , one aide to mr belhaj said and mr sallabi said that mr jibril , along with the americaneducated finance and oil minister , ali tarhouni , were ushering in a new era of tyranny and dictatorship , al jazeera reported during the 42 years of colonel qaddafi s rule , underground organizations like mr belhaj s libyan islamic fighting group and the muslim brotherhood were the only opposition although outlawed and persecuted , they had a network through mosques that secular opponents of the government could not match that has also given them a head start in political organizing now , and they appear to be wasting no time there will be attempts by some parties to take over it s only natural , said one prominent official with the transitional national council , who spoke anonymously so as not to alienate islamists and definitely etilaf is trying to increase its influence and we 're hearing much more from the islamists in the media because they are more organized and they are more articulate mr nayed conceded that might be true , but was unconcerned my answer to anyone who complains about that you must be as articulate as they are and as organized as they are , he said and i think we 're starting to see that among various youth groups fathi ben issa , a former etilaf member who became an early representative on the tripoli council , said he quit his position after learning that the muslim brotherhood members who dominate that body wanted to ban theater , cinema and arts like sculpture of the human form they were like the taliban , he said we did n't get rid of qaddafi to replace him with such people the final straw , he said , came when etilaf began circulating a proposed fatwa , or decree , to bar women from driving most libyans are quick to bristle at suggestions that their own islamists might one day go the way of iran , where after the fall of shah mohammed reza pahlavi , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini stomped out a shortlived liberal government by denouncing democracy as unislamic mr sallabi said he hoped libyans could find a leader on the model of george washington , whom he had been reading about lately after his struggle he went back to his farm even though the american people wanted him to be president , mr sallabi said he is a great man referring to mr sallabi , mr ben issa , who said he has received death threats since breaking with the islamists , retorted he is just hiding his intentions he says one thing to the bbc and another to al jazeera if you believe him , then you do n't know the muslim brothers

a dot earth commenter , sas from new york , posted a constructively provocative retort after my latest piece on eating alien invasive species where possible considering that humans are the ultimate invasive species , the whole concept of labeling any other species as invasive seems like a conceit of little value if humans , in our natural comings and goings , have managed to aid another species to relocate to an additional hospitable environment so successfully that it becomes indigenous and endemic it s really more of an invitation than an invasion , isn t it \? watch the spread of deforestation in bolivia from 1984 to 1988 and compare it to bacteria on agar and you get the idea this afternoon , eric from massachusetts posted a valuable reply , building a powerful case against a laissez faire attitude toward the biological mashups we re creating his long and thoughtful comment , pasted below , meshes with my view that humans , increasingly , will have to make conscious choices about which species or ecosystems to protect , which to let go and which to manage for the properties we care about the norm here is to reserve your dot posts for nonanonymous contributors one of my experiments in trying to foster constructive discourse through positive reinforcement of good behavior but , it s more of a rule than a guideline and , well , i am in charge the initiating comment above is a bit biting , but there is always some merit in pausing for a little self reflection , given that humans too often look at the living world as something separate from us this is part of what i was getting at in proposing that a dose of anthropophilia is needed in charting a smooth path in this century one answer , of course , is that we are the organism that has risen \( at least for now \) to a position allowing us to make choices about other species fates , whether they are invasive , indigenous , useful or simply to our eyes beautiful we could also make such choices based purely on an ethical obligation to conserve everything around us as is that may be fine in places where there is the luxury of making such choices , but don t count on this happening in , say , java where the last 40 or so javan rhinoceroses are making a last fragile stand someone will have to pay for that bit of conservation \( which is one reason i was glad to see leonardo dicaprio retweet my post last night \) increasingly , societies will have to make choices about spending to blunt invasions of overabundant intruders or rare , but cherished , species none of this will be easy the choices will go beyond answering , how much nature is enough \? another way of framing this moment in human history is , which comes first , peak everything or peak us \?  here s eric s contribution pushing back against letting go in the face of ecological invasions \( i ve added a couple of contextual links \) to those who raise the humans are invasive species too point i recently participated in a debate on this topic i just find that perspective so utterly unhelpful , i just don t get what we re supposed to do with it , does it mean we should ignore species we see doing harm , because we do harm \? it would seem to lead to inaction , which we stewards of our \( admittedly damaged \) world cannot accept in any event , i here offer my comments from that discussion debate i often hear this sentiment from people both with and without ecological training , from novice gardeners to phd level ecologists i would like to encourage some reflection on the implication of what i think we could call a kind of let nature take its course view when it comes to invasive species the view could also be described perhaps as survival of the fittest or who are we to say a species is bad or something along these lines let s take up the point that humanity has invaded continents , the implication being , since we do it , who are we to feel dismayed about japanese knotweed \? senior environmental planners make this point , in response to my referring to species like garlic mustard as biological pollution they have asked me if i view humanity as biological pollution too \? by equating humanity to knotweed , are we raising knotweed up in the moral sphere , or lowering humanity \? if we re ready to somehow equate humanity with knotweed , and admire \( or regret \) both for their ability to occupy niches , well how about aids \? its an impressive little life form , one dazzling virus , the way it occupies our immune system s t lymphocytes is so clever this is silly of course , we don t take a let nature take its course approach to infectious disease no matter how cute the microbe , at least not for diseases that affect humans we spend billions of dollars , in the us alone , to push back against pathogens through vaccines , sanitation programs , health education , r and d on antibiotics , etc those microbes that harm the things we care about are deemed threats , and we work hard to avoid them eradication of some of the most harmful , including smallpox \( globally \) , polio \( we re globally close \) , and in the us malaria , dengue , yellow fever , and cholera , have been deemed among the great successes of public health we are aiming to extinguish entire species of microbes , and yes we will celebrate when it happens we choose to fight things that threaten what we care about  in forestry there is also little debate that gypsy moths and the asian longhorned beetle \( alb \) among others have warranted and warrant enormous expenditures of money and personpower in nearby worcester the aphis officer in charge of the alb control effort is overseeing 90 employees , with the objective of complete eradication of that beetle some may argue the alb is occupying an unfilled niche , living maple tree phloem , but it threatens things we care about , namely the 4 billion per year maple industry in new england \( maple timber syrup fall foliage \) we choose to fight things that threaten what we care about this brings us to knotweed or garlic mustard , etc these are not public health menaces like cholera , and its harder than the alb to quantify their harm we can t totally eradicate them but in our parks and gardens they create monospecific stands replacing native vegetation garlic mustard releases chemicals that reduce our native trees fungal partners \( mycorrhizae \) to near zero these two plants occupy niches so exclusively they harm a thing we care about parks specifically created to conserve and showcase native species because the harm is less costly , or at least less perceptible , than the alb and similarly conspicuous threats , there is less call for public expenditure to control them in sum , biological entities from viruses to beetles to aggressively invasive herbs exist on a spectrum of concern , and of course this thing we call concern is an anthropocentric one humans have preferences ! in this light , we see how misguided is the let nature take its course attitude rather , we each decide where on the spectrum of concern to act , to protect the things we care about we all seek to protect humans from disease , we all support control of the alb , and i also choose to protect my town parks from knotweed and garlic mustard thanks , both of you , for weighing in addendum in keeping with eric s comment , i plan on testing some recipes for garlic mustard pesto once the crop in our woods comes up this spring \( i ll try to enlist mark bittman as a taster \) also , i encourage you to visit a blog i just discovered , invasivore , for a lot more on ways to exploit that which you can t eradicate
some of the blogs i follow marginal revolution , ezra klein have given ample attention to tim harford s new book , adapt why success always starts with failure so i solipsistically assumed that everybody must be aware of it but then i happened to glance at this book s amazon ranking , which as i write is down on the wrong side of 1 , 500 this is an outrage , people ! for the good of the world , a bigger slice of humanity should be aware of its contents so i m doing my bit to publicize it \( i don t know harford in any way , shape or form \) harford starts out with the premise that the world is a very complicated and difficult place at the dawn of the automobile industry roughly 2 , 000 car companies sprang into being less than 1 percent of them survived even if you make it to the top , it is very hard to stay there the historian leslie hannah identified the ten largest american companies in 1912 none of those companies ranked in the top 100 companies by 1990 harford s basic lesson is you have to design your life to make effective use of failures you have to design systems of trial and error , or to use a natural word , evolution most successful enterprises are built through a process of groping and adaptation , not planning the russian thinker peter palchinsky understood the basic structure of smart change first seek out new ideas and new things next , try new things on a scale small enough so that their failure is survivable then find a feedback mechanism so you can tell which new thing is failing and which is succeeding that s the model variation , survivability , selection harford then illustrates how this basic process can work across a variety of contexts , from business to war to poetry he s an able guide to the world of human fallibility for example , he cites james reason who identifies three kinds of error first , there are slips in 2005 a young japanese trader meant to sell one share of stock at 600 , 000 yen but accidentally sold 600 , 000 shares at 1 yen then there are violations , when someone intentionally breaks the rules this is what bernie madoff did then there are mistakes things you do on purpose but with unintentional consequences errors can be very hard for outsiders to detect a study by alexander dyck , adair morse and luigi zingales looked at 216 allegations of corporate fraud regulators and auditors uncovered the fraud in only one out of six of those cases it was people inside the companies who were most likely to report fraud , because they have local knowledge and yet 80 percent of these whistleblowers regret having reported the crimes because of the negative consequences they suffered this is not the way to treat people who detect error harford is an economic journalist , so he doesn t get into the psychological and spiritual traits you need to live with error and look it in the face , but he offers a very useful guide for people preparing to live in the world as it really is
the united states is home to 11 million illegal immigrants the undocumented hold jobs , have children , pay taxes , use government services and too often live in fear what is to be done about them \? it s a difficult question , and one the republican presidential candidates in the last two debates spent a great deal of effort avoiding unlike ronald reagan , none of these republicans favor amnesty , and president george w bush s comprehensive solution tougher enforcement and legalization , with penalties has gone nowhere comprehensive reform is president obama s answer , too , which means no republican today dares support it asked about illegal immigrants , the candidates settled on the simplestsounding response seal the border what about immigrants already here \? same answer seal the border this was both a nonanswer and a call for billions in new government spending , which was very strange to hear from politicians also determined to slash even the most basic public services any chance they get the sealtheborder answer is not only not a solution , it cynically misrepresents what s happening on the ground it falsely paints the border region as a dangerous place when american border cities are among the safest in the country it also denies the fact that presidents bush and obama have already spent years and billions on border fencing , more border patrol officers and national guard troops , spy planes , even seismic sensors as for spending billions more to stanch the flood , illegal crossings are at the lowest they have been in decades , because of the fence and the terrible economy we were hoping that mitt romney of massachusetts , rick perry of texas and jon huntsman of utah would at least offer sensible solutions , having dealt with the reality of immigration in their years as governors but reality is clearly not on the agenda mr romney has slipped into and out of practically every immigration position possible he endorsed president bush s call to create a path to citizenship , but when senators john mccain and edward kennedy offered a bill to do just that , he opposed it as governor he blocked instate tuition for undocumented students he now opposes amnesty , rejects a special deal on legalization and supports building a fence , technologically mr perry maintains that fencing off texas s 1 , 250mile border is too expensive instead , he favors more troops and spy planes mr huntsman , who once endorsed comprehensive reform and driver s licenses for the undocumented , called mr perry s skepticism about a fence pretty much a treasonous comment mr perry was also attacked for signing a bill giving instate tuition to the undocumented i'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them , you go be on the government dole , ' he explained for that he was booed but even this assertion of an old american ideal of immigrants as contributing members of society was only a faint echo of mr perry s former moderation in 2001 , he told the dallas morning news that he was intrigued by and open to president bush s comprehensive reform approach a legalization plan , he said then , was better than illegal immigrants living in fear of the law and afraid to access basic services that s the definition of a sensible , proamerican immigration policy today , it s also republican heresy
just days after a debate in california , the eight republican presidential candidates will square off again monday night at a forum in tampa , fla the debate is being jointly sponsored by cnn and the tea party express the moderator , cnn s wolf blitzer , will be asking some questions submitted by tea party members a move that could inject a different feel into the exchange follow the action on our new live debate dashboard we will bring you the highlights , quick analysis , fact checking and scenes from tampa and then come back to nytimescom for the best coverage of the 2012 campaign the tea party debate is over , but the conversation will clearly reverberate for days after what was the most spirited clash of the 2012 campaign so far from the exchanges over social security , the hpv vaccine and immigration to a backandforth over afghanistan , viewers were treated to some memorable moments and republican voters got a lot to chew on as they move toward deciding which candidate would be better to run against president obama stay with the caucus and my colleagues here at the new york times as we continue to cover this campaign and the other political activity in washington and come back here next week for another debate , this time from orlando , fla  michael d shear romney says that obama s healthcare plan will ultimately create a panel that will tell people what kind of care they can get true \? mr romney said the federal health care legislation championed by president obama would ultimately lead to panels that dictate to people what kind of health care they can get while it is not clear precisely what panel mr romney was referring to , the health care law did create the independent payment advisory board , which is tasked with slowing the growth in medicare costs , and the board has drawn criticism from many republicans and some democrats for taking too much power away from lawmakers the board will consist of 15 voting members drawn from among physicians , other health professionals and experts in health care finance and delivery , nominated by the president and approved by the senate but while the board does have the power , starting in 2015 , to propose specific cuts to medicare if spending appears likely to exceed projected levels in any given year , those proposals are not binding on congress , though the law makes it relatively hard to overrule the recommendations and the law spells out that the board s recommendations shall not include any recommendation to ration health care , raise revenues or medicare beneficiary premiums  nicholas confessore the political crosscurrents in the tea party can be rough and unforgiving mr perry discovered that tonight mr perry has shot to the top of the polls in the republican presidential campaign in part by embracing the tea party and conservative , evangelical voters in his party but , as measured by the reaction in the hall tonight , those voters will have some reasons to look at mr perry skeptically when the conversation turned to mr perry s executive order on the hpv vaccine , the audience was clearly not happy having applauded and cheered him earlier , the audience suddenly turned sour a few minutes later , mr perry again found himself on the outs with the audience as he sought to explain his decision to support instate college tuition for illegal immigrants there were plenty of boos from the audience , and cheers for mr perry s rivals , who reject such help for people who are not legally in the country of course we do not give instate tuition credits to people who have come here illegally , mr romney said mrs bachmann added , i think the american way is not to give taxpayer subsidies mr perry s campaign has been animated by tea party members and their sense that he is the candidate who can best bring their philosophy to washington but that support is clearly still up for grabs , and if tonight is any indication the tea party movement still has questions for the governor of texas  michael d shear mr huntsman is trying really , really hard to inject himself into this debate , and , more to the point , into the campaign but so far , his attempts tonight seem to have fallen mostly flat , at least as measured by the audience in the hall his first attempt was a jab at mr perry for suggesting that the entire border with mexico would never be totally secured that , mr huntsman suggested , was almost treasonous the second was a reference to mr romney s reputation for having changed many of his positions over the years we could spend all night talking about where mitt s been on all the issues , and that would take forever , mr huntsman said both were clearly attempts to get off a good line that will get attention but they seemed forced , and the audience hardly reacted he will have to do more than that to move the needle , it seems  michael d shear a viewer asked the candidates how they would achieve energy independence , but only mr cain was allowed to answer he said the united states had sufficient natural resources to eliminate all imports of oil , which is technically true , but it would require opening public lands and waters that are now off limits , including the atlantic and pacific coasts and the arctic ocean , a plan supported by most republicans and oil companies but opposed by many other americans mr cain further said that he would create a commission to review regulations at all federal agencies , beginning with the environmental protection agency , a proposal he has made before he said the panel would be composed of people who had been abused by the epa that would presumably include executives of businesses , including utilities and oil and gas companies , who have complained for years about the burden of meeting a variety of federal clean air and water laws  john m broder mr perry has a complicated relationship with immigration he s had to balance securing the border with the cultural and emotional connection texas has to mexico , and to the state s hispanics , who make up 38 percent of the population but he got the first boos of the night for his decision in 2001 to allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay instate tuition at public universities in texas hit hard on this by mrs bachmann and mr santorum , who joked that it might be mr perry s effort to attract latino voters , mr perry quickly switched from his compassionate approach to the pragmatic one tea party voters want to hear this is a states rights issue , mr perry said in the state of texas , where mexico has a clear and a long relationship with this state , we decided it was in the best interest of those young people to give them the opportunity to go on to college meanwhile , while his opponents suggested that texas needed a border fence , mr perry continued to demand that the federal government step up with border patrol agents on the ground ms ramshaw is a reporter for the texas tribune mr perry s rivals pounced with a vicious fervor on his decision \( later withdrawn \) to require young girls in his state to receive inoculations against the virus that can cause cervical cancer mr perry has said he made a mistake in issuing that executive order , and he repeated that apology tonight he said he should have worked with the legislature instead that was not nearly enough for his rivals mrs bachmann accused mr perry of having put forth a policy in which innocent little 12yearold girls have a government injection by an executive order she followed it up with a financial allegation as well , accusing mr perry s former top aide at the time a lobbyist for the vaccine maker , merck of benefiting from the executive order there was a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate , mrs bachmann said the governor s former chief of staff was the chief lobbyist for this drug company \( her aides quickly followed it up with a fact sheet titled rick perry s crony capitalism the 2007 vaccination executive order fiasco \) and she was not the only one mr santorum piled on i believe your policy is wrong , mr santorum said there is no government purpose served by having little girls inoculated this is big government run amok and it should not have been done in an email to reporters , mr perry s campaign wrote , governor perry has always been a strong believer in protecting parental rights , which is why this executive order allowed parents to make the final decision about whether or not their daughter was vaccinated it will be interesting to see whether the issue catches fire , or whether the governor s repeated acknowledgment that he was wrong will be enough  michael d shear mrs bachmann had a turn in the spotlight after wolf blitzer asked her to respond to mr perry s executive order mandating the human papillomavirus vaccine for adolescent girls \( texas lawmakers overruled the mandate , which mr perry has always said was designed to protect young girls from cervical cancer \) mrs bachmann reminded the audience that mr perry s former chief of staff was a lobbyist for merck , which manufactures the vaccine , and that mr perry got campaign contributions from the drug maker the contributions were 5 , 000 but there s no question that the lobbyist , mike toomey , played a major role in mr perry s decision to issue the executive order if you re saying i can be bought for 5 , 000 , i m offended , mr perry fired back mrs bachmann had her own choice line i m offended for all the parents and little girls who didn t have a choice also on rick perry s 5 , 000 contribution from merck the texas tribune s ryan murphy just ran the numbers merck \( courtesy of merck pac \) has given almost 30 , 000 to perry in the past 10 years ms ramshaw is a reporter for the texas tribune perry says the first stimulus bill created zero jobs true \? like most of the republican candidates , mr perry takes a dim view of the american recovery and reinvestment act , which was championed by president obama and approved by congress in 2009 the stimulus bill , mr perry said tonight , has created zero jobs but the reality is more complicated there is no question that mr obama is presiding over a period of profound economic misery and high unemployment since mr obama became president in january 2009 , according to the bureau of labor statistics , the country has lost 1 , 705 , 000 jobs and while the president s advisers had once predicted that the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent , they were wrong according to the department of labor , it is now at 91 percent , a level the white house believes will not abate before the end of next year but without the federal stimulus bill the situation would probably be worse , most fiscal and budget analysts , including many wall street firms , agree according to data collected by the nonpartisan congressional budget office , the stimulus bill , between its passage in february 2009 and june 2011 , has increased the number of people employed by 1 million to 29 million , figures that include jobs created and jobs preserved moreover , while the stimulatory effect of the bill peaked in 2010 and is now declining , according to the research , it is still preserving jobs that might otherwise be lost and during the second quarter of 2011 , the bill raised real gross domestic product by 08 percent to 25 percent the bill has proved somewhat more expensive than originally estimated , however , with a total budget impact of about 825 billion over 10 years rather than 787 billion mr romney repeated his line , we re an energyrich nation , but we re living like an energypoor nation he has never quite explained what he means by this , but the united states consumes more energy per capita than any nation on earth outside the persian gulf  john m broder mr paul said the united states embassy in baghdad cost 1 billion and was bigger than the vatican almost the congressional research service says the final cost was 736 million \( a 140 million cost overrun \) the embassy compound covers 104 acres vatican city covers about 110 acres  john m broder as mr perry was assailed by some rivals for his misleading claim that social security is a ponzi scheme , he also seemed to be debating himself at times mr perry used the debate to talk about the need to shore up social security , which politicians on the left and the right agree is needed if the program is to be able to continue paying out full benefits a quarter of a century from now but in making his case , mr perry both exaggerated the problems facing social security and adopted a very different tone than he did in his book fed up just a year ago , in which he described social security as a failure that we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now tonight , mr perry said social security had to be fixed so that our children actually know that there s going to be a retirement program there for them but in the past , as mr romney correctly pointed out , mr perry has repeatedly suggested that social security , which pays benefits to 56 million americans , is undesirable , and that it may even be unconstitutional read more  michael cooper mr perry used a question on balanced budgets to talk about how he saved money by consolidating 12 state agencies into 5 but that move in 2003 has been often debated and highly controversial under the legislation , the state outsourced a large number of services to private companies , paying them billions of dollars a year many of mr perry s own aides and staffers , as well as state lawmakers , have gone to work for the contractors providing these services ms ramshaw is a reporter for the texas tribune one of the biggest challenges for mr romney will be the jobs and economic record in texas , where mr perry has presided as governor for the last decade but he s clearly got a strategy describe the success in texas as having little to do with mr perry and more to do with the environment that mr perry oversaw during the debate tonight , mr romney cited the state s oil , its lack of an income tax , its righttowork laws and a republican legislature as evidence that just about anyone could have done well as governor if you re dealt four aces , that doesn t make you a terrific poker player , mr romney said mr perry couldn t have expected that exact attack , but he had a pretty good retort you were doing pretty good until you got to talking poker , mr perry said the serious question , though , is whether mr perry s record of job creation and the economic situation in texas will mean more to regular republican voters than the background that mr romney cites  michael d shear newt gingrich , peacemaker \? at least in the past two debates , that s the role mr gingrich has been playing , trying to turn the focus away from republican squabbles and back to president obama at the debate in california last week , mr gingrich told the moderators , well , i m frankly not interested in your effort to get republicans fighting each other and tonight , after a backandforth between mr perry and mr romney over social security , mr gingrich sought to break up the fight yet again i m not particularly worried about governor perry and governor romney frightening the american people , when president obama scares them every day , mr gingrich said  ashley parker does the audience matter at these debates \? if so , then mr perry might have the edge over his main rival , mr romney the hall is filled with members of the tea party , a group that views mr romney with suspicion and that was clear in just the first few minutes of the debate mr perry got much applause for his answers about social security mrs bachmann got some applause for calling for an ownership society , in which personal responsibility and property ownership takes precedence over government handouts even mr paul got applause but the audience seemed downright tepid toward mr romney as he attacked mr perry on social security and defended his own experience on jobs mr romney might take solace in the fact that the audience in tampa is hardly representative of the overall republican electorate \( much less the overall country \) but if the disparity continues , it might make harder for mr romney s spinners to convince people that their man won the debate after it s over  michael d shear two of the candidates who have to make a real impression at the debate tonight have taken very different approaches early on mrs bachmann was thrown a softball , getting the first question , about social security , from a tea party member but instead of going after rick perry and maybe getting a bit of attention she quickly shifted the conversation to her talking points about obamacare meanwhile , mr huntsman , the former utah governor , who has been totally overshadowed at previous debates , showed a lot more energy asked about social security , he basically said of mr romney and mr perry a pox on both your houses we ve got the answers , a spirited mr huntsman said we don t have leadership  michael d shear michele bachmann , asked about social security and medicare , said , we know president obama stole over 500 billion out of medicare to switch it over to obamacare this is a distortion of the health care law passed last year in its effort to stem the inexorable rise of medicare spending , the law carves out 500 billion in savings over 10 years , through a combination of higher medicare payroll taxes and reduced payments to providers those savings were credited toward expanding health care to those who are currently uninsured although it s roughly correct to say 500 billion was shifted from the medicare program to the new health care program , it s a stretch to say the money was stolen , especially since the medicare savings were also adopted in the budget that house republicans passed earlier this year \( but the senate rejected \)  trip gabriel gov rick perry was hit early with a predictable question on social security , which mr perry has called a monstrous lie and a ponzi scheme in an opinion column published in usa today on sunday , he toned it down a little , saying social security needed to be saved mr perry , who mr romney has said wants to away with the entitlement program , started off with a firmly worded promise that people who currently rely on social security won t be weaned off it and that those nearing retirement will be safe , too at the debate , mr romney is trying to portray mr perry as a flipflopper , saying he used to want to abolish the program , and has now changed his tune mr perry is doing the same thing , quoting from mr romney s book , in which he suggested that social security was effectively a criminal enterprise on paper , the two candidates apparently believe the same thing in practice , they re each accusing the other of changing his tune ms ramshaw is a reporter for the texas tribune well , that didn t take long on the very first question of the night , and without all that much prompting , mr perry and mr romney began a spirited exchange over social security the exchange was an indication of how much mr romney is worried about mr perry s surge in the polls and also an indication of how much mr romney thinks mr perry s statements on social security could be fatal for him mr perry , who has called social security a ponzi scheme and a failure , sought to defend his comments , but mr romney was having none of it over and over , mr romney directed questions directly at his rival do you still believe that social security should be ended as a federal program like you did six months ago \? mr perry was ready for it , saying that his book was designed to spark a conversation we re having one of those now , mr romney said  michael d shear those watching the republican debate may be missing monday night football but watching the debate s intro on cnn , they might have been confused like a good sports contest , a deepvoiced announcer offered viewers a list of the contenders mitt romney the early frontrunner rick perry the newcomer michele bachmann the firebrand and the rest of the field jon m huntsman jr the diplomat ron paul the libertarian rick santorum the fighter herman cain the businessman newt gingrich the big thinker the announcer did not call it a smackdown but the candidates were introduced by wolf blitzer , the moderator , in a way that made you expect to hear about their height and college \( as in at 6foot6 , from north carolina \) and the announcer did say eight candidates one stage one chance to take part in a groundbreaking debate  michael d shear just days after a debate in california , the eight republican presidential candidates will square off again tonight at a forum in tampa , fla on the agenda an expected clash over social security as rick perry , the governor of texas , refuses to back away from calling the retirement program a ponzi scheme mr perry s rivals have spent the weekend hammering him on the issue , which will probably take center stage tonight also at play will be efforts by the other candidates to seize the spotlight from mr perry and mitt romney , the former governor of massachusetts that is especially true for representative michele bachmann of minnesota , whose campaign has faded since she won the ames straw poll in iowa last month others on the stage will include representative ron paul of texas jon m huntsman jr , the former governor of utah herman cain , the former ceo of godfather s pizza newt gingrich , the former house speaker and former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania one thing that could be different tonight \? the debate is being jointly sponsored by cnn and the tea party express the moderator , cnn s wolf blitzer , will be asking some questions submitted by tea party members a move that could inject a different feel into the exchange stay with the caucus as we unveil our new live debate dashboard we will bring you the highlights , quick analysis , fact checking and scenes from tampa and then come back to

beijing landed like hand grenades in the world of chinese philanthropy one showed her wearing sunglasses and leaning on the hood of a white maserati another revealed her closetful of herm s handbags yet a third showed her sipping a drink in a businessclass cabin on an airline flight none of it was outrageous by the standards of s nouveau riche what ignited a firestorm was the fact that the woman , guo meimei , 20 , appeared to hold a senior position at the , a government organization that is the country s largest charity under the name guo meimei baby , she had boasted on her microblog that her title was commercial general manager at the red cross , a claim that had apparently been verified by sina , the internet company hosting the microblog at the same time , she posted photos and entries detailing her jetset life , writing of the orange lamborghini she drove in the south \( her little bull \) and the white maserati she had in beijing \( her little horse \) since an internet user pointed out the scandalous posts in late june , ms guo and the red cross have been on the chinese internet the red cross of china , which is a member of the international federation of red cross societies , has denied any ties to ms guo , who some internet users speculate got her title because she is the mistress or relative of a top red cross official the police are investigating her some chinese news reports said monday that ms guo was the girlfriend of wang jun , a much older man who organizes charity drives for the red cross some people fear the scandal and the accompanying increase in suspicions of corruption in charities could deal a major blow to philanthropy here , even as some officials increasingly rely on nonprofit groups to help cope with growing social needs like health care and education people have had doubts for a very long time , said jia xijin , director of the nongovernmental organization research center at tsinghua university in beijing the issue is public trust or accountability of charities , the accountability of philanthropy organizations in china philanthropy is only beginning to develop here as more and more chinese enter the middle and upper classes forbes this year listed , up from 64 last year some are looking to do good through charity donations the sichuan earthquake in 2008 led to a rise in civic consciousness , and the next year the government recorded 8 billion in donations flashy philanthropists have emerged , like the recycling magnate chen guangbiao still , there have been questions raised about whether wealthy chinese are too stingy , a topic that came up when warren buffett and bill gates flew to beijing last year some say many chinese are reluctant to donate their wealth for fear that the money will end up in a corrupt organization that fear is mostly rooted in the government s insistence on controlling charity work and promoting its own vast organizations , while setting limits on the activities of private foundations so large staterun charities , especially the red cross , are suspect in the eyes of many chinese those groups have wide latitude in soliciting donations from the public , and are designated by the government to be focal points of charity collection during times of disaster , when people are looking for any outlet to help the needy official figures published in february 2009 showed that the red cross collected more than 735 million in donations after the sichuan earthquake , even though some prominent people , like the real estate tycoon wang shi , advised against giving to the group several recent episodes have raised suspicions in april , a photograph circulating on the internet showed a 1 , 500 restaurant bill for a meal had by a small group of people employed by the shanghai branch of the red cross then on june 26 , in the middle of the guo meimei scandal , the national audit office issued a report on the red cross that listed five financial problems it had uncovered one that drew widespread criticism was that the organization , which had an approved budget in 2010 of almost 45 million , had overpaid an equipment procurement contract by 650 , 000 a typical online attack during the guo meimei scandal came from yu jianrong , a prominent scholar at the chinese academy of social sciences , who said on his microblog that if the red cross did not initiate reform to build an open system , it will lose all credibility with the people and then i will personally boycott it many chinese do not trust the red cross because of its special legal status it is one of 25 large organizations that register with an office that answers to both the communist party and the state council , china s cabinet virtually all other nonprofit groups in the country are supposed to register with the ministry of civil affairs , which counts 420 , 000 such entities on its rolls they get public financial support , their staff is paid by the government and their function is to serve as an agency of the government , ms jia said the group also has affiliated organizations that are not legally registered at all one example that has emerged during the guo meimei scandal is a shadowy group called the red cross of the commercial sector , about which there is little information in general , only the red cross and a smaller government organization , the chinese charity federation , can ask for public donations , ms jia said during times of crisis , like the sichuan and yushu earthquakes , the government might allow other groups to raise money , but officials always put the red cross on the front lines of charity drives feng lun , a real estate mogul who started a charitable foundation under his company , the vantone group , said in an interview that the staterun organizations do n't have transparency and are n't efficient enough , largely because they lack managers with professional experience running charities the guo meimei scandal erupted june 21 , when someone on the chinese internet pointed out the photographs that ms guo had been posting and the red cross job title on her microblog , a sina weibo account her blog had been marked with a v , meaning her identity had been verified by sina , even though she had claimed earlier she was an actress internet users quickly began condemning ms guo she first defended herself by saying her group was a commercial operation separate from the red cross as public pressure grew , the red cross and ms guo said they had nothing to do with each other internet users soon pointed out the existence of the murky group called the red cross of the commercial sector , which has ties to the red cross the red cross reported ms guo to the police on june 24 two days later , ms guo apologized online for her stupid and ignorant behavior and madeup identity paparazzistyle photographs showed her arriving in the beijing airport on june 27 from shenzhen , where she also lives , and rushing off in a private sedan on tuesday , beijing news reported that the police had begun an investigation although chinese newspapers have been running articles and editorials about the controversy , censors last week deleted some of the original microblog posts that accuse the red cross of corruption that scramble to censor underscores the delicate nature of the scandal this is just the beginning of the unveiling of the problems of staterun nonprofit organizations and charities , mr feng said i think this can be a positive force to push chinese civil society to promote more transparency
washington to become an effective fighting force , the amateurish groups of volunteers that are the fighting force , such as it is , of the libyan rebellion would require far more than just shipments of weapons from army special forces sergeants , who specialize in building guerrilla militias from scratch , and all the way to the secretary of defense the assessment is the same the rebels have plenty of small arms , such as automatic weapons the introduction of heavy weaponry , such as longrange artillery , should not be the priority what could blunt government assaults by armored vehicles on rebel positions and antiqaddafi cities would be modern , precise antitank weapons but rebels would need weeks of training to put them to use , as they are not as easy to operate as the movies and video games would suggest the true gamechanger on the ground in libya would be training the rebels to carry out what the army calls fire and maneuver combat at the smallunit level that could bring some logic , coherence and effectiveness to their efforts on the battlefield rebel offensives thus far have been disorganized , ad hoc , relying mostly on allied air cover and luck better communication would be vital to that effort but while radios and other communications equipment could easily be brought to the rebels through the porous eastern border with egypt , any outside effort to turn rebel bands into a militia with formal commandandcontrol structures able to pursue specific , tactical advantages over a betterorganized government force would take weeks , if not months robert haddick , the managing editor of small wars journal and a columnist for foreign policy magazine , said the rebels most significant need is basic instruction in both offensive and defensive tactics at the smallunit level and in identifying and training commanders you could train hundreds of men in those skills , maybe even thousands , in two months , probably , mr haddick said but i think the more difficult task , and something that would take far more time , would be to select leaders squad leaders , platoon leaders and company commanders , he said there is no good estimate on how many libyans have taken up arms on the side of the rebellion many are not even fulltime , but show up for a fight and then return home they are of questionable physical conditioning they have little training in weapons and none in military discipline among the rebels , according to american intelligence estimates , are about 1 , 000 men who have trained with the libyan army , as both officers and foot soldiers , before changing sides the government s force is estimated at roughly 30 , 000 additional small arms probably would not be enough to change the balance on the ground , said andrew m exum , founder of the abu muqawama blog and a fellow at the center for a new american security who , as an officer in the army rangers , the military s elite light infantry , commanded units in afghanistan and iraq more sophisticated weapons systems , especially antitank weapons , might make a difference , as would some armored vehicles , he said mr exum , who wrote a doctoral dissertation on hezbollah in lebanon , noted that the first antitank weapons were given to the radical militia in the 1980s but even with statesponsorship from iran and syria for their terrorist activities and military actions , hezbollah was unable to become a proficient fighting force against the israelis for at least a decade the issue with any type of advanced weapons system is the amount of training required , mr exum added there is no shortcut to addressing the imbalance between qaddafi s forces and the rebels while the americanbacked rout of the taliban government in afghanistan after the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , is an example of where outside assistance turned the tide of a war , that initial victory has little in common with the situation on the ground in libya the antitaliban militias , in particular the northern alliance , had a dedicated leadership structure atop a seasoned fighting force in quality , they were the taliban s equal they were just fewer in number and held less territory so , with the help of army special forces units and small cia teams to pinpoint airstrikes and manage the infusion of weapons , the antitaliban forces swiftly altered the balance on the ground one concern that is in the back of some minds is the possibility that more sophisticated weapons might fall into the hands of qaeda sympathizers but with little likelihood of the united states providing arms to the rebels , few analysts have raised that concern publicly
trenton in the middle of a bright manhattan summer afternoon , the ' 46 million pitcher steps from his fashionable east side apartment building and slips into a waiting lexus for a chauffeured ride to the ballpark but the car does not turn north for the fivemile drive to yankee stadium the destination is instead trenton or scranton , pa , where for the last five years kei igawa has pitched for two yankees minor league teams day after day , start after start , complete with the return trip to manhattan plucked from a japanese baseball allstar team roster in 2007 and introduced at a lavish news conference , igawa was expected to be a staple in the yankees' starting rotation he lasted 16 games , most of them regrettable outings that were sometimes spectacularly inept booed off the field , he was called one of the worst freeagent signings in yankees history after his last , losing appearance for the yankees in early 2008 , he was banished to the farm system and he has not come back except for his nightly returns to manhattan but igawa s unusual commute is only part of a long , strange journey the fiveyear saga is a story of a giant mistake of a contract and an overmatched pitcher , a huge organization digging in and a quiet , somewhat mysterious japanese pitcher with a sense of honor and a durable love of the game the yankees made it pretty clear igawa would never pitch again in the bronx , but they were determined that he pitch somewhere for his 4millionayear salary they tried to return him to japan , too igawa refused to go , standing fast to his childhood dream of pitching in the american big leagues and so , the stalemate remarkable , if almost entirely unremarked upon continues the yankees let him gobble up innings before small crowds in distant outposts as a cavalcade of younger prospects push past him on their way to yankee stadium igawa never complains , and in a tribute to either willpower or lower level longevity , he has set farm system pitching records and with just a few months left on his contract , he still dreams of the major leagues , if no longer as a yankee about two weeks ago , on a rare day off , igawa celebrated his 32nd birthday alone at his manhattan apartment he did not consider attending a yankees game in the bronx , nor did he tune them in on his television i do n't watch their games anymore , igawa said i never follow them igawa had a 23 record and a 679 earned run average when the yankees sent him to class aaa scranton wilkesbarre in august 2007 three pitching instructors had already executed a kind of pitching intervention igawa had been told to give up his old motion and learn a new delivery , which included changes in the coil of his left arm , the swing of his right leg and even where he stood on the pitching rubber that did n't work out too well , igawa said last week , recalling the spring of 2007 as he sat in the small , crowded locker room of the yankees' class aa trenton thunder affiliate this season , igawa has been shuttled between trenton and scranton , frequently making just one start at class aaa before being demoted again to class aa in 2007 , i did what the coaches told me in tampa , but i was not effective , he said they let me go back to my old delivery , and i produced for the team indeed , he produced a 54 record with a 369 era , but that team was still the scranton wilkesbarre yankees yes , scranton , igawa said with a laugh , something he does easily and often about 2 hours and 10 minutes from manhattan because his english is limited , igawa travels everywhere with an interpreter , subaru takeshita \( pronounced tahkahshetah \) igawa will engage in brief conversations in halting english , especially when joking with teammates , but relies on takeshita , who is paid by the yankees , for most communication takeshita helps igawa answer reporters' questions , picks him up for the daily commute , accompanies him on road trips and goes onto the field during games should the manager or pitching coach visit igawa on the mound i have learned some english and spanish , igawa said through takeshita i can use it to get around my neighborhood i know restaurant menus but a broadway show or a movie \? i ca n't do that because i do n't understand what they are saying he has made some friends in new york , but not many , he said in the five years he has maintained an online diary , he has rarely mentioned another person the only photo on his is a picture of himself , jogging alone in the locker room , even on a team where the players are 8 to 10 years younger , igawa is welcomed into the frequent poker games , popular for having an that teammates can borrow and appreciated for his sense of humor for someone who does n't speak much , trenton catcher austin romine said , he has a lot of funny oneliners currently on the disabled list with tightness in his elbow , igawa usually sits in his corner locker by the door and reads several players said igawa s curious predicament a celebrated yankees freeagent acquisition and a threetime japanese league allstar now playing in places like bowie , md , and altoona , pa rarely comes up although on payday last week , his fellow pitcher pat venditte did switch the envelope left in his locker with the one left for igawa igawa returned venditte s check and said , no , thanks an average salary at class aa is about 2 , 500 a month igawa makes roughly 130 times more everybody respects what he s done and he never has an attitude that he s too big for this , romine said whether they send him up or down , whether they put him in the bullpen or the starting rotation , his disposition is always the same but come on , we know how he feels during trenton games , there is often no room for igawa to sit in the dugout he will trundle out to the makeshift bullpen in foul territory along the rightfield line he sometimes sits under an umbrella beside a children s playground he rarely reacts to the action on the field he does n't want to be here , romine said he s doing what he s told it s hard when someone owns you igawa is occasionally recognized as a professional baseball player on the streets of new york people think he is hideki matsui until recently , he said a common second guess was chienming wang , the former taiwanese yankees pitcher at 6foot1 and 215 pounds , with a thick shock of black hair , igawa has a calm but notable presence , although he says he dresses conservatively to avoid attention during his first years in new york , igawa struggled to find japanese food stores , especially ones open late , and he lost weight it bothered him that he might go weeks without hearing his native tongue the winter temperatures were new to him so he remained inside if he felt lonely and missed japan , he would visit an electronics store because examining all the new models and emerging technologies reminded him of something he would do at home it has been 16 years since hideo nomo became the first modernera japanese professional to play in the united states there have been other distinguished japanese successes since , like ichiro suzuki , and dozens of largely unnoticed flameouts about 15 players have returned to play in japan an equal number retired igawa fits neither category he is the stillfamous flameout he cannot escape that he was a big star in japan , winning 75 games in his last five years and leading the japan central league in strikeouts for three of those years in recent years , when a japanese team has qualified for the little league world series , the players have made the pilgrimage to scranton to greet the great igawa , before whom they stood in awe a few days ago , the trenton sales office got a call a group of 20 japaneseamericans wanted to come to a game , but only when igawa was scheduled to pitch my fans' support adds motivation , said igawa , who is accessible and good with crowds in public , even englishspeaking ones but away from the ballpark , igawa is exceedingly private , almost reclusive takeshita said in the two years he has been his interpreter , he has been inside his apartment once , very briefly takeshita lives in queens and keeps igawa s car , picking him up on the street when they are driving to the ballpark igawa decided years ago to commute from manhattan for the simplest of reasons he thought his stay in scranton would be temporary after the first year , once he had learned his way around new york , it seemed easier to stay than to pick up and learn a new city besides , would n't his second season be mostly in the bronx \? or , in some way , would n't moving from manhattan be admitting failure \? by the time his minor league existence became more permanent , the driving habit had become routine , and igawa likes a routine somehow , his minor league managers say , he has never been late to the ballpark in five years igawa is married and has children , and they visit him in new york for a couple of months each year , usually just as the baseball season is ending but takeshita has never met any member of the family asked when he was married and how many children he has , igawa smiled and said he does not give out that information he also declined to give the name of his wife it is just safer that way , he said , somewhat cryptically on trips , teammates said igawa keeps to himself and does not accompany groups of players going out after a game the one place they do see him is outdoors running during the day maintaining a grueling exercise regimen is customary for japanese professional baseball players for the last five years , igawa s teammates arriving at the ballpark knew they would see igawa already doing sprints in the outfield or running the stadium steps then he would do the running assigned by the team as well during igawa s first spring training in america , joe torre , then the yankees manager , was astonished when his coaches discovered igawa throwing a baseball against a fence unsupervised the yankees had their own throwing schedule for igawa , but he wanted to throw more and was perplexed that the yankees disapproved bobby valentine , now a broadcaster with espn , has managed in the american and japanese professional leagues the concept that less might be more does not compute in japan , valentine said it s a problem for japanese pitchers over here if igawa was throwing when the yankees did n't know it , he was n't doing it to be a contrarian in japan , they think if you do n't throw every day you not only wo n't be successful , you do n't deserve to be successful so that does n't surprise me but valentine was surprised that igawa was still in the yankees minor league system i thought he had gone back to japan years ago , valentine said asked last week to assess igawa s five years in the yankee organization , general manager brian cashman answered it was a disaster we failed cashman quickly added that in 2008 and in 2009 he had negotiated a deal to return igawa to two different japanese professional teams i drove to scranton , sat him down and told him it was our assessment that his abilities did n't translate into a major league career , said cashman , who added the yankees would have been relieved of some financial obligations in the japanese deals i told him that it was our fault our mistake not his but i said , if you stay , you 're not going anywhere' and he refused the trade both times major league teams have not expressed an interest in trading for igawa in the last four years , cashman said , although he conceded igawa s fiveyear , 20 million contract the yankees also paid 26 million in bidding rights could be keeping some teams away in 2007 , the san diego padres claimed igawa off waivers and cashman was ready to make the trade but he said , ownership was not willing to let him go yet kevin towers , who was the padres' general manager at the time and now holds the same title with the arizona diamondbacks , said he thought igawa might have had more success in the national league and at san diego s petco park getting him out of the new york market might have helped , towers said by telephone the expectations in new york are enormous and immediate , and if you do n't succeed right away , for japanese players , there has to be added pressures and cultural adjustments last year , towers was a special assistant scout to cashman and spent two weeks with the scranton team i was amazed that kei was still there grinding it out , towers said igawa s best minor league season was in 2008 when he had a 146 record with a 345 era the next year he was 108 with a 415 era in time , using a deceptively sharp curveball and sneaky changeup while spotting an average fastball , igawa set the scranton wilkesbarre franchise record for career victories with 33 he has set or is close to setting several other franchise pitching records but cashman said none of igawa s minor league accomplishments brought him closer to the bronx looking at his 2008 minor league totals , cashman noted that igawa s qera or quikera a statistic that estimates what a pitcher s era should be based on his strikeout rate , walk rate and ground balltofly ball ratio was 452 that tells me he s a fly ball pitcher and that s not good in the major leagues , cashman said look , we 've had plenty of pitching holes if he could have filled one , he would have been here cashman called igawa a great clubhouse guy and denied that he was taking a spot normally reserved for a top prospect he said luxury tax penalties sometimes cited for igawa s lengthy minor league stay had no impact on how igawa was used he did n't block anyone who was moving up , he said again , if he could help us or help us get another player we could use , the luxury tax would n't have stopped us in the end , cashman sounded mystified by igawa it s the most curious case i 've ever heard of , he said and frustrating the lesson is to be very careful with japanese pitchers i give him credit for living a dream and for fighting the fight it ca n't be easy it has to bother him , too cashman added , he does things his own way like commuting to and from manhattan yeah , he s passed me on the drive down to trenton , cashman said he drives faster than his fastball igawa , who often snickers when he begins to answer a question , was stoic and straightfaced last week when he was told he had now pitched in 104 minor league games and thrown more than 525 minor league innings he had sat on the bench or waited in the bullpen through more than 5 , 700 innings , riding buses from maine to kentucky and from richmond to rochester teammates , managers , trainers and pitching coaches came and went igawa stayed , the only journeyman left who could tell new prospects where to park their cars so they would not get hit by a foul ball or explain how the outfield walls were different at the home park five years ago was this the odyssey he envisioned when he agreed to leave japan in 2007 \? no , igawa answered before another trenton game , sweaty from the pregame sprints and toweling off so he could slip into his game uniform but it is still baseball i get to pitch i love being on the mound it is my job , but it s also what i want to do i get to see new places i would never have seen otherwise and it is my duty to do my best igawa , whose complete major league record from 20078 was 24 with a 666 era , concedes he did not pitch well in his time with the yankees but he also thinks he could have done better had he been given more than  america is a different world from japan and so is american baseball , he said i had never pitched out of the bullpen i had never pitched on four days rest the hitters here also have more power another adjustment i look back now and i have developed a cut fastball , i throw my changeup differently i understand american hitters better so i think i would have done better if i had more time the first season and i wish i had then what i have now the goal next year is to show off what he has learned to another team , anywhere in the world he would even return to the minors again , if he thought he had a legitimate chance to make his new team s major league roster towers believes some american and japanese clubs will show interest once his yankees contract is out of the way , towers said , the landscape might change it s like he s been out of sight in the minors forever as valentine said , i 've seen lefties with less stuff than he has have success in the majors igawa is aware that baseball fans , and especially yankees fans , view him as a renowned bust yankees fans may always think of me as not being successful , said igawa , whose record this season at trenton and scranton is 32 with a 368 era but i 've grown as a pitcher and as a person i 'll be better for these five years i do not regret coming here spend enough time with igawa , however , and it becomes clear that he has moments when he is dismayed on july 14 , the yankees signed j c romero , a 35yearold lefthander who had just been released by the washington nationals romero was assigned to scranton wilkesbarre igawa got the news standing at this locker in trenton his shoulders sagged slightly and he slumped to a chair he was asked if he ever wants to shout , what about me \? he shook his head i am japanese , he said i do n't go crazy too often i'm not going to throw things or make a scene in five years , i have seen this happen over and over four days later , cashman burst through the trenton clubhouse door and nearly stumbled over igawa , whose locker is next to the entrance the two have not had a conversation longer than hello since 2009 , but cashman gave igawa a smile and a playful jab in the arm as he walked toward the office of trenton manager tony franklin cashman was there to discuss a promotion to the big leagues back in his yankee stadium office the next day , cashman summoned to the yankees igawa s trenton teammate , steve garrison , a 24yearold lefthander with no major league experience garrison s trenton record this season is 36 with a 626 era the team made the announcement in the early afternoon igawa was already in his car , on the road from manhattan to trenton he had to be on the field for a pregame workout at 3 pm
two of my favorite analysts , rhodes cook and josh putnam , have a good debate going about just how plausible it is that a republican who is not currently running for president could enter the race later and potentially win it \( probably necessitating a brokered convention \) those of you who follow my twitter feed will know that i think mr cook has the stronger side of the argument i think there is a small but nontrivial chance that the republican nominee could be someone like jeb bush , paul ryan , mitch daniels , tim pawlenty or chris christie \( in fact , i was speculating about these scenarios as long as a month ago \) i m not going to describe the means by which this would occur mr cook covers that in great detail instead , i m more interested in the motive the motive is simple republicans are dangerously close to having none of their candidates be acceptable to rankandfile voters and the party establishment it s not clear what happens when this is the case there is no good precedent for it but since finding a nominee who is broadly acceptable to different party constituencies is the foremost goal of any party during its nomination process , it seems possible that republicans might begin to look elsewhere a recent gallup poll asked republican voters directly about which candidates they d consider acceptable nominees only two , newt gingrich and mitt romney , were deemed acceptable by a majority of republican voters the other six candidates \( including herman cain , who has since dropped out \) were considered unacceptable by a majority of the party s voters unfortunately , this particular question is not asked all that often by pollsters \( a shame , since it s a really important question \) so i cannot offer categorical proof that this situation is unprecedented gallup did pose the question to both republican and democratic voters in 2007 , however , and the results from that poll suggest that the predicament that republicans now find themselves in is at a minimum unusual in 2007 , both democrats and republicans had four broadly acceptable candidates rather than two of course , a party does not need four acceptable candidates it needs only to settle on one but the two republicans who fit this description for the time being , mr romney and mr gingrich , might become unacceptable to a majority of the party depending on how nasty the nomination fight gets mr romney is already considered unacceptable by 41 percent of republican voters , and his favorability ratings have been fading recently although he is still ok for now , he does not have all that much margin to spare it s plausible that his ratings could turn negative if he runs a negative campaign , as other candidates begin to criticize him , or if he makes one or two significant gaffes mr gingrich has a fair amount of personal baggage and his favorability ratings were quite poor with republican voters at points earlier in this cycle he is now taking fire from all sides , including from mr romney , from other candidates , like ron paul , and from portions of the conservative media but say that mr gingrich survives this , as he certainly could he wins iowa and then either wins new hampshire or finishes a respectable second there he continues to lead in national polls of republican voters , as he does now what happens then \? one possibility probably the most likely one is that mr gingrich wins south carolina , wins florida and holds on to win the republican nomination but mr gingrich might nevertheless be considered an unacceptable choice by much of the party establishment that would put us in uncharted waters there hasn t really been a case in the past where a candidate who held the national polling lead after new hampshire was considered unacceptable by the party elite most of the time , the establishment \( as measured by endorsements \) and the rank and file \( as measured by support in national polls \) have agreed upon a candidate by that point there have been six cases in recent decades in which there was no clear frontrunner after new hampshire these are discussed briefly below 1972 democrats edmund s muskie , the clear favorite of the party establishment , won both iowa and new hampshire the performances were perceived as disappointing , however , and mr muskie was at only about 20 percent in national polls \( still good enough to put him in a rough tie with hubert h humphrey \) a third candidate , george mcgovern , who had helped to design the reformed nomination rules and cagily exploited them by dominating in caucus states , won the nomination despite taking only about 25 percent of the national popular vote 1976 democrats party leaders were slow to endorse any candidates in 1976 , but jimmy carter surged to the national polling lead after wins in iowa and new hampshire although mr carter was a relatively obscure figure who was not beloved by the party establishment , he nevertheless took the nomination this is among the more favorable precedents for mr gingrich , although it differs slightly from this year in that there was no consensus among the establishment about whom to support in place of mr carter 1984 democrats walter mondale was the clear favorite of the establishment and seemed headed for an easy nomination after a dominant performance in iowa the favorable media attention to gary hart s secondplace showing , however , gave him momentum that he rode to a victory in new hampshire , after which he drew into a rough tie with mr mondale in the national polls mr mondale eventually prevailed in a close race 1988 democrats michael dukakis , the eventual nominee , had won new hampshire but had lost iowa to dick gephardt mr dukakis was roughly tied for the endorsement lead with al gore , and was roughly tied in the national polls with jesse jackson thus , mr dukakis was in the strongest overall shape , although he was not dominant in any one category , so the nomination took some time to sort out 2008 democrats this was a strange case hillary rodham clinton regained the national polling lead after her comeback win in new hampshire however , barack obama who had once considerably trailed mrs clinton in party support announced a series of important endorsements from senators like john kerry and claire mccaskill in the week just after new hampshire , making the question of who had the party establishment s support ambiguous 2008 republicans john mccain pulled into the national polling lead after his win in new hampshire , although it took further wins in states like south carolina and florida before endorsers \( who had long been split between mr mccain , mr romney , rudolph w giuliani and fred thompson \) closed ranks around him although there are some loose parallels to this year in the 1972 and 1976 democratic primaries , none of them involved an acute conflict between the establishment and the rank and file of the sort we have this year between mr romney and mr gingrich it is not a year like 2008 , when the democrats had at least two broadly acceptable nominees , in which you d expect to see a brokered convention or a darkhorse candidate emerging instead , it s a year like this one , in which all the choices are unacceptable to some degree or another there are deterrents , of course , to a candidate like mr bush or mr ryan entering the race late most notably , there is no guarantee that they would succeed if they tried and failed , that could be an unmitigated disaster for the republican party , undermining its eventual nominee but the odds of a darkhorse candidate or brokered convention will increase to the extent that any of the following conditions hold 1a mr gingrich leads the delegate count , but does not have more than about 50 percent of delegates 1b mr gingrich holds more than 50 percent of delegates but is involved in a significant gaffe or scandal at some point later in the campaign 2a mr romney has performed poorly enough in the early states that he is no longer viable 2b mr romney is viable but his unfavorability ratings have considerably increased to the point that he no longer qualifies as a consensus choice 3 a factional candidate like ron paul holds 10 percent or 15 percent of the delegates all of these conditions seem plausible based on what we know right now , which is what leads me to believe that a brokered convention is plausible as well
baton rouge , la \( ap \) experience at quarterback was not the only advantage topranked louisiana state held over no 17 florida spencer ware rushed for 109 yards and two scores , and each of lsu s senior quarterbacks passed for touchdowns as the tigers comfortably defeated the gators , 4111 , on saturday jarrett lee gave the tigers \( 60 , 30 southeastern conference \) the lead for good on their second offensive play , hitting rueben randle deep over the middle for a 46yard touchdown jordan jefferson used a jump pass to mitch joseph for another score florida \( 42 , 22 \) was forced to start the freshman jacoby brissett at quarterback because of injuries to the senior john brantley and the freshman jeff driskel brissett was intercepted twice on deep throws , once each by safety brandon taylor and the star cornerback tyrann mathieu but lsu did not seem to need the help it led by 170 after its first three possessions and was never threatened in what became its sixth doubledigit victory the tigers , who have trailed for only 6 minutes 33 seconds all season , more than doubled the gators in total yards , 453213 lsu had 238 rushing yards alone alfred blue added 70 yards on 14 carries and a late 2yard touchdown run to cap the scoring for lsu after a week of deception by florida coach will muschamp , who said driskel was his likely starter in place of brantley , muschamp instead went with brissett , who became the first florida freshman to take his first snap as a starter brissett was able to buy time with his scrambling ability and complete intermittent passes , but struggled to sustain drives taylor s interception came on brissett s seventh career pass brissett finally got florida in the end zone on a 65yard connection to andre debose , who mathieu appeared to let run free after shoving him out of bounds and apparently thinking he was out of the play mathieu did not let it happen again , stepping in front of brissett s next deep pass for his second interception of the season that was only the latest defensive highlight for the lsu star , who also has forced four fumbles , and has returned two of his three fumble recoveries for touchdowns this season brissett finished 8 of 14 for 94 yards driskel , who injured his ankle in relief of brantley during the gators' 3810 loss to alabama a week earlier , did not play at all instead , muschamp tried rotating in receiver trey burton and chris rainey as singlewing quarterbacks none of it amounted to much against an lsu defense that entered the game ranked ninth nationally in total defense and scoring defense , despite playing three ranked teams away from tiger stadium including powerhouse oregon in dallas in its first five games lsu found the end zone on its first two possessions after the quick strike to randle , the tigers had a methodical eightplay drive that included seven runs and covered 57 yards , with a little help from an offside penalty ware capped it with a 2yard touchdown run the tigers appeared to have scored a third touchdown when punter brad wing covered 52 yards on a fake late in the first quarter , but he raised his arms moments before crossing the goal line that drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty , which took the score off the board lsu retained possession , but had to settle for a 35yard field goal by drew alleman wing still got credit for a 44yard run , which made him the second leading rusher of the second half behind ware s 63 ware scored his second touchdown on an 8yard run in the second quarter , helping lsu take a 243 halftime lead
following up on my review last week of via verde , a groundbreaking green housing project soon to be completed in the melrose section of the south bronx , i took a walk around that neighborhood with amanda m burden , director the department of city planning under mayor michael r bloomberg we shot some video of our tour please watch it by clicking here  via verde aside , nearly a dozen public housing complexes have been built in melrose during the last decade , as part of the mayor s 85 billion initiative to preserve and add some 165 , 000 subsidized apartments around the city it seemed like a good idea to make the video to give times readers a look at a few of the buildings and some sense of the scope of the change that has come to the south bronx none of the citysponsored housing developments is as architecturally ambitious as via verde , a publicprivate initiative , and they are not as meticulously built , but they are examples of the latest thinking about what subsidized housing should look like in this neighborhood the idea is to increase urban density , with largescale apartment buildings modeled after what you might call traditional brickfaced new york city apartment houses so there are retail spaces on the ground floor and trees along the sidewalks and the best of the places roughly mimic an old upper west side building st ann s , just around the corner from via verde , is a prime example occupying an entire city block , the facade is varied to make it appear as if there were several buildings instead of one giant one , and to bring the appearance of the scale down to something a little less overwhelming we didn t show in the video enough of the single family , brownstonestyle housing that has also restored a little stoop life to various blocks , along with homeownership the latest census shows that people have been moving back to the south bronx in big numbers it s a still a poor neighborhood housing isn t the same as jobs , after all , but as ms burden remarks in the video , one is dependent on the other and in the end , because all parts of the the city are interdependent , the entire city benefits when this area improves we re still figuring out the best way to open up a forum for discussion of architecture and urbanism , but meanwhile we re welcoming comments and hoping you ll follow me on twitter kimmelman  an earlier version of this post misstated the amount of money dedicated to the initiative to preserve and add subsidized housing

given how much sway the tea party has among republicans in congress and those seeking the republican presidential nomination , one might think the tea party is redefining mainstream american politics but in fact the tea party is increasingly swimming against the tide of public opinion among most americans , even before the furor over the debt limit , its brand was becoming toxic to embrace the tea party carries great political risk for republicans , but perhaps not for the reason you might think polls show that disapproval of the tea party is climbing in april 2010 , a new york times cbs news survey found that 18 percent of americans had an unfavorable opinion of it , 21 percent had a favorable opinion and 46 percent had not heard enough now , , tea party supporters have slipped to 20 percent , while their opponents have more than doubled , to 40 percent of course , politicians of all stripes are not faring well among the public these days but in data we have recently collected , the tea party ranks lower than any of the 23 other groups we asked about lower than both republicans and democrats it is even less popular than much maligned groups like atheists and muslims interestingly , one group that approaches it in unpopularity is the christian right the strange thing is that over the last five years , americans have moved in an economically conservative direction they are more likely to favor smaller government , to oppose redistribution of income and to favor private charities over government to aid the poor while none of these opinions are held by a majority of americans , the trends would seem to favor the tea party so why are its negatives so high \? to find out , we need to examine what kinds of people actually support it beginning in 2006 we interviewed a representative sample of 3 , 000 americans as part of our continuing research into national political attitudes , and we returned to interview many of the same people again this summer as a result , we can look at what people told us , long before there was a tea party , to predict who would become a tea party supporter five years later we can also account for multiple influences simultaneously isolating the impact of one factor while holding others constant our analysis casts doubt on the tea party s origin story early on , tea partiers were often described as nonpartisan political neophytes actually , the tea party s supporters today were highly partisan republicans long before the tea party was born , and were more likely than others to have contacted government officials in fact , past republican affiliation is the single strongest predictor of tea party support today what s more , contrary to some accounts , the tea party is not a creature of the great recession many americans have suffered in the last four years , but they are no more likely than anyone else to support the tea party and while the public image of the tea party focuses on a desire to shrink government , concern over big government is hardly the only or even the most important predictor of tea party support among voters so what do tea partiers have in common \? they are overwhelmingly white , but even compared to other white republicans , they had a low regard for immigrants and blacks long before barack obama was president , and they still do more important , they were disproportionately social conservatives in 2006 opposing abortion , for example and still are today next to being a republican , the strongest predictor of being a tea party supporter today was a desire , back in 2006 , to see religion play a prominent role in politics and tea partiers continue to hold these views they seek deeply religious elected officials , approve of religious leaders' engaging in politics and want religion brought into political debates the tea party s generals may say their overriding concern is a smaller government , but not their rank and file , who are more concerned about putting god in government this inclination among the tea party faithful to mix religion and politics explains their support for representative michele bachmann of minnesota and gov rick perry of texas their appeal to tea partiers lies less in what they say about the budget or taxes , and more in their overt use of religious language and imagery , including mrs bachmann s lengthy prayers at campaign stops and mr perry s prayer rally in houston yet it is precisely this infusion of religion into politics that most americans increasingly oppose while over the last five years americans have become slightly more conservative economically , they have swung even further in opposition to mingling religion and politics it thus makes sense that the tea party ranks alongside the christian right in unpopularity on everything but the size of government , tea party supporters are increasingly out of step with most americans , even many republicans indeed , at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum , today s tea party parallels the antivietnam war movement which rallied behind george s mcgovern in 1972 the mcgovernite activists brought energy , but also stridency , to the democratic party repelling moderate voters and damaging the democratic brand for a generation by embracing the tea party , republicans risk repeating history
in 2003 , espn significantly expanded its coverage of the world series of poker , which was eventually won by a 27yearold nashville accountant named chris moneymaker , an amateur who had qualified for the tournament on the web site pokerstars mr moneymaker , averagelooking and slightly overweight , was a proverbial everyman , betting and bluffing his way past hundreds of pros en route to a 25 million purse his win , along with the increasing availability of internet poker , inspired an untold number of americans to quit their jobs or at least cut down on their other hobbies and pursue the dream of being a poker champion the poker boom was under way within three years , the number of participants in the world series of poker s 10 , 000 main event skyrocketed from 839 to 8 , 773 more people played in the event in 2006 than in the first 33 years of the tournament combined but last week , the department of justice unsealed a 52page indictment against the chief executives of three largest companies that offer online poker games to americans pokerstars , full tilt poker , and absolute poker and a related civil complaint against the companies themselves no players including wellknown professionals like phil ivey and howard lederer who hold equity in full tilt poker were charged in the indictments but the web sites and their chief executives were accused of a variety of crimes , ranging from bank fraud to running an illegal gambling operation the doj seeks 3 billion in compensation from the online companies , and up to 65 years of prison time for some of the 11 defendants the indictments , quickly dubbed black friday by the poker community , came as a shock to the large number of americans estimated variously at between 13 million and 15 million who play poker online for real money at web sites like the two plus two forums , american players went from bragging about their winnings and bemoaning their bad beats to contemplating an uncertain future that would deprive some of them of their income , with one of dozens of threads on the indictments generating more than 13 million page views conversations with a number of elite american players and people with knowledge of the legal and business issues some of which were confidential because of legal sensitivities revealed nearly as many reactions as there are ways to play a poker hand , and varying degrees of optimism and pessimism about poker s future an unstable status quo the indictments represent the biggest threat to american poker players since oct 13 , 2006 , when the congress in virtually its last act before the recess for the midterm elections passed the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act the legislation , attached to a must pass port security bill , had passed the house 31793 earlier that year , but it had been considered unlikely to pass the senate because of procedural holds placed upon the legislation the thenmajority leader , bill frist of tennessee , put a renewed emphasis on the legislation , seeking favor with values voters as he was contemplating running for the republican presidential nomination in 2008 the bill , which did not redefine online gambling but instead criminalized various actions related to facilitating financial transactions for it , spurred the thenlargest poker company , party poker , to leave the us market meanwhile , the department of justice was stepping up enforcement of the industry , including the january 2007 arrest of the principles of neteller plc , an online ewallet that allowed players to transfer funds into and out of poker sites the game was never completely the same for american players during the poker boom years of 2003 through 2006 , the online player pool was at least doubling in size every year , according to dan stewart of pokerscoutcom the number of new and inexperienced players made the games relatively easy to beat , and between 2004 and 2006 , i played a substantial amount of online poker , using it as my primary source of income despite playing essentially in my spare time in 2007 , however , the games became more competitive casual players were the most sensitive to the new regulations and new impositions to withdrawing and depositing money , removing some of the weakest players from the poker ecology i went from a significantly winning player to a modestly losing one , giving back about onethird of the money that i had made during the boom years , and withdrawing the other twothirds other players and the poker sites themselves soldiered on , however while party poker , a publiclytraded company that was under shareholder pressure to avoid legal liability \( it preemptively settled with the department of justice for 105 million to further reduce its legal exposure \) , withdrew from the american market , other companies like full tilt poker and pokerstars asserted that federal gambling laws , including the federal enforcement act , were not inclusive of poker , and continued offering games with full tilt poker and pokerstars gaining much of partypoker s share in the us market , the number of online poker players has increased slowly , if somewhat unsteadily , at an annualized rate of about 20 percent , according to data provided to the times by mr stewart , of pokerscout but most of that growth has occurred outside of the united states according to taylor caby , a poker player and entrepreneur who owns cardrunners , a web site that offers poker coaching and instructional videos , about 70 percent of the sales of his software products now occur outside the united states , and the fraction is increasing every year on a percapita basis , americans are only about half as likely to play poker online as their counterparts in canada and europe , where online poker is explicitly legal and beneath the surface , the regulations contained within the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act which were implemented slowly because their ambiguous language had drawn a number of objections from banks were beginning to have their desired effect several months ago , i was told by brandon adams , a highstakes poker player and teaching fellow at harvard , that pokerstars and full tilt poker were having increasing trouble finding reliable payment processing companies , which act as intermediaries between the poker sites and commercial banks some companies , a number of which were cited in the department of justice s complaint on friday , were absconding with funds intended for players , or had those funds seized by the government mr adams estimated that at least 10 percent of the transactions between americans players and the poker sites were compromised in this fashion although the poker sites always made good on player withdraws , they would sometimes credit a player s account with a deposit before the intermediary company had debited the funds from the player s bank account , allowing players to essentially play for free if the intermediary disappeared before the transaction was completed the difficulties with payment processing were something the poker companies were willing to tolerate for access to the american market the department of justice s complaint , however , alleges that some of the techniques they used to secure the services of the payment processors were illegal , and constituted money laundering or bank fraud player deposits at two sites likely to be returned the indictments on friday left millions of dollars in deposits from us players in limbo mr adams estimated that pokerstars and full tilt poker collectively had on the order of 500 million in deposits from us players another highstakes player that i spoke with , tom dwan better known in the poker community for his online handle durrrr and his relentlessly aggressive style of play thought mr adams s estimates might be too conservative both had heard rumors of american players with as much as 5 million in their poker accounts on wednesday , however , the department of justice announced that it had brokered an agreement with two of the three sites , full tilt poker and pokerstars , that would allow them access to their seized domain names in order to assist in the return of funds to us players in exchange , full tilt poker and pokerstars agreed not to offer realmoney games to american players although player funds could conceivably still be at some risk if the sites were to cease operating entirely , these companies still have viable businesses outside of the united states pokerstars , according to various public and private estimates , does between 70 and 75 percent of its business in the international market , and full tilt poker does between 50 and 60 percent but players with deposits at the third company charged in the indictment , absolute poker \( which also offers games under the ultimate bet brand \) could be at substantially greater risk unlike full tilt poker and pokerstars , absolute poker did not reach an agreement with the justice department on player funds , and instead has continued to offer games to americans the damages that the department of justice is seeking from absolute poker 500 million represent a much higher fraction of their revenues , putting its survival into greater question nor do players necessarily expect absolute poker to act honorably the company has a reputation in the poker community for unscrupulous behavior , largely because of a scandal in which players with connections to the owners of the sites were alleged to have cheated by playing in the games while having access to every opponent s cards , essentially making them clairvoyant an uncertain future although pokerstars and full tilt poker collectively accounted for about 80 percent of the usfacing market , some other companies will probably continue to offer service to the united states there are plenty of other sites that are still facing the us market , said mr caby , the cardrunners owner none of them had the reputation that the ones that were indicted have but people wll move to sites that will take their action that is assuming , however , that the doj s probe does not expand further , something which is highly uncertain some of the potential replacements for full tilt poker and poker stars , such as bodogcom , flout the law much more flagrantly by offering sports betting for the time being , the department of justice especially its manhattan office , which tends to pursue highimpact , highprofile defendants like bernard l madoff might not have interest in such lowhanging fruit but if these sites were to grow , they would make themselves easy targets the way that these cycles work is that they tend to be slowmoving and it s likely that they get worse in time rather than better , said mr adams another concern is that poker coverage on television could significantly decrease , since it relies heavily on advertisements placed by companies like pokerstars in some cases being tantamount to infomercials espn , which has been responsible for much of the coverage but tends to be very cautious about how it applies its brand , has pulled pokerstars advertisements from its web site , and is reviewing whether to continue poker programming at all , although there are indications that they will continue to broadcast the world series of poker some smaller tournaments have already been cancelled a spokesman for the world series of poker , ty stewart , which could see its sponsorship opportunities and coverage cut back , did not return email messages and phone calls the prospects for legislation poker s future will probably depend on efforts to legalize the online version of game in july of last year , a bill sponsored by representative barney frank of massachusetts , which would have superseded the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act and legalized , taxed and regulated online gambling , was approved 4122 by a house panel although the bill then stalled , a version of it which would have granted online poker licenses to a select number of landbased casinos and racetracks was being pushed by the democratic majority leader , harry reid , and was extremely close to being included in the budget compromise that was passed during the lameduck session of congress in december , according to john pappas of the poker players alliance , a lobbying group that advocates for legalization of online poker one way the indictments could spur legislation is by unifying the poker community behind the efforts of the poker players alliance when provisions to legalize online poker were under discussion last year , some players opposed them because the regulations would have established a 15 or 18month moratorium during which no operator could offer games to the us , an effort to level the playing field demanded by the american gaming association with the benefit of hindsight , that is a trade that american players would gladly have taken the status quo was obviously untenable , yet many online players believed that even without legislative clarity online poker would exist , said mr pappas the downside case is that the allegations could taint online poker with the stench of illegality and scare legislators away from an issue that rankandfile voters are at best indifferent about but mr frank thought the indictments were a boon to his legislation i think frankly it will help us in our efforts , mr frank told me you don t want to have laws that are on the books but not enforced , he said , noting that the arrests could help underscore the hypocrisy of the government s current position on gambling , which permits online wagering on horse racing , the lottery , and bricksandmortar and riverboat casinos , but not online poker large casino companies , like caesars and mgm , which were once lukewarm on online poker , were behind the push for legislation last year , and are increasingly of the view that promoting some forms of gambling at the expense of other , highly similar forms is not a good longrun strategy nevada people have talked about it , mr frank said they re aware its just not a good idea for them to be aligned with people who think gambling is the work of the devil mr pappas , meanwhile , said that the ppa had an increasingly good relationship with horse racing companies like churchill downs inc although it was not widely reported outside of the horse racing press , the national thoroughbred racing association came out in favor of efforts to legalize online poker last year the support of these companies could be crucial because the republican leader in the senate , mitch mcconnell , is from kentucky , where churchill downs runs the kentucky derby and contributes significantly to his campaign if there is an alignment of interests between mr mcconnell and the democratic leader , mr reid of nevada , the prospects for legislation improve mr pappas thought there was a realistic chance that a poker bill could be passed as soon as the end of this year , particularly in a case where the regulations were attached to a larger bill in the context of something like a budget negotiation , mr reid and mr mcconnell would have more influence over the content of the legislation although the house could be a bigger obstacle than the senate , mr pappas noted that support for poker legislation does not split cleanly along partisan lines we now have a republican lead bill in the house now and we are working with other republican lawmakers to introduce more propoker legislation soon , mr pappas said it is also important to note that the new freshman class of republicans have a different mindset than the social conservative republicans that pushed uigea in 2006 the eightyplus new lawmakers tend to be more libertarian minded but poker players , who tend to have vaguely libertarian but mostly indifferent views toward politics , may not be aware of how difficult it is to get anything done in washington , even when there are a number of interests coalescing some people inside the poker industry are delusional when it comes to the likelihood of legislation , mr adams said the doj s indictments on friday were the bookend to mr moneymaker s fairy tale if the golden , innocent age of american poker wasn t already over , it truly is now whether there is a another poker boom on the horizon , or the game instead enters a sort of dark ages , remains to be seen
paris was pindrop quiet , which was both welcome and eerie for anyone who has listened to her shrieks and wails and come onnns echo through the chambers of grand slam tournaments all these years was quiet but hardly at peace , focusing on the serve she was about to hit to stay in the match a second serve that had been failing her repeatedly in the swirling wind and pressure of her semifinal against  she has a huge , big serve , li said later and i was like , please , double fault , and i can win the match bounce bounce think think thousands in the stadium all bracing for the same thing , and then it was on its way , smacking all too predictably into the tape , sending li and presumably quite a few of her chinese compatriots into the kind of euphoria that only comes with a big sporting surprise i never believe myself i can be in the final of the french open , and today i got it , the sixthseeded li said after her 64 , 75 victory she will face , the defending champion with the effervescent personality and baroque onehanded backhand from where else \? italy schiavone defeated marion bartoli , the last french player remaining , 63 , 63 , in thursday s second semifinal schiavone has not won another tournament since her surprise run to the title in paris last year , but she clearly is in symbiosis with roland garros when i come here , i feel something special , that s all , she said schiavone is 30 this year , while li is 29 their combined age makes this the oldest women s grand slam final since jana novotna beat nathalie tauziat at wimbledon in 1998 it has been a rough two weeks indeed for the youngsters , including the no 1 seed , caroline wozniacki , 20 , who was upset early age just paper , li said it s just plus one , does n't mean anything unlike schiavone , li had never been past the fourth round in paris until this year , but she has saved her best for the big events this season in january , she became the first chinese player to reach a grand slam singles final , losing in the australian open final to kim clijsters since then , she has done little of note , but now , on her least favorite surface , she has become the first chinese player to reach the french open singles final , too li , who is a solidly built 5 feet 7 inches , has now snuffed out three threats in a row she needed three sets to defeat no 9 seed petra kvitova of the czech republic in the quarterfinals but needed just two sets to defeat no 4 victoria azarenka of belarus in the quarterfinals on wednesday as it turned out , facing azarenka was an ideal warmup for facing sharapova both go for returns and the lines with ferocious , flat power both make a lot of noise classic claycourt tennis this is not , but then of the final four this year , only schiavone , with her flamboyant topspin and acrobatic slides , plays classic claycourt tennis this has been a warm and sunny year when the has played more like a hardcourt , and the high bounces have not hurt schiavone s topspin , either neither li nor sharapova made any extended slide on thursday their quick feet moving about the clay as if it were the cushioned acrylic of melbourne park or flushing meadows but flat power hitting on a gusty day like thursday is risky , and while there were plenty of eyecatching rallies where the ball repeatedly cleared the net by tiny margins , there were also errors in abundance , more from sharapova , who does not move laterally as well as li she played a very good match , and she certainly played a lot better than i did and a lot more solid , and she played the crucial points better , said sharapova , who finished with 12 winners and 28 unforced errors , none more demoralizing than her 10 double faults sharapova has occasionally struggled with her serve since returning to the game from shoulder surgery in 2009 she has other strengths that can compensate , but her serving demons surfaced at crucial moments thursday she doublefaulted three times at 34 in the opening set to lose her serve though she broke li back in the next game , she appeared to be going for less power than usual on her first serve in the next game she was broken again , losing the set when she misjudged a highbouncing midcourt forehand and knocked it into the tape in the second set , with li struggling early on her shakier forehand wing , sharapova served with a 43 lead and ended up doublefaulting on break point in the final game , she doublefaulted twice more at 15all , eliciting a groan from the crowd , and then again on match point the result was a muted end to a noisy match and a missed opportunity for sharapova , who has won the other grand slam titles and had an unexpected chance to complete her collection i'm quite proud of what i 've achieved here , but i still feel like i have a lot of work to do , sharapova said li , however , need only worry about preparing for the final and about trying to become the first player from the world s most populous country to win a major singles title this time i know what i should do in the final , she said
the federal deposit insurance corporation has proposed rules for clawing back compensation paid to executives of too big to fail financial institutions that do , in fact , fail the rules are disappointingly weak and because they are watered down , bank executives may again be encouraged to take excessive risks why are these compensation rules important \? clawback rules are needed because the financial crisis was caused in part by insufficient penalties for financial executives' poor performance executives took excessive risk , which doomed their institutions and caused the government to spend hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to rescue many of them yet these same executives were rewarded for their failures and have retained tens of millions of dollars in pay james e cayne , the former chief executive of bear stearns , still lives in his 2824 million apartment at the plaza hotel joseph j cassano the former chief executive of aig financial products , kept more than 100 million in compensation and e stanley o'neal , who was the chief executive of merrill lynch , retired with a pay package valued at more 300 million if you are a financial executive , you may want to try to play the same game in the future why not \? you keep millions in gains , and if you mess up , the government stands behind your institution ending this type of incentive system is therefore critically important to prevent the next financial crisis strongly penalizing executives when their institutions fail will help ensure they take care to prevent such disaster the doddfrank act contains provisions intended to address such distorted incentives the law provides that when a toobigtofail institution is put into receivership , the fdic can recover the last two years of compensation from any current or former senior executive or director substantially responsible for the failed condition of the institution the details of this requirement are to be spelled out by the fdic , but the agency s proposed rules destroy the law s letter and spirit the fdic has proposed that an executive be held substantially responsible for an institution s failure if he or she failed to conduct his or her responsibilities with the requisite degree of skill and care required by that position the agency proposes that there is a presumption that executives were substantially responsible if they were the chairman of the board of directors , chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the failed institution at first blush , these would seem to be good rules the problem is defining requisite degree of skill and care courts and other regulations often look to state law to flesh out this concept , and most big financial institutions are governed by delaware law in delaware , the state courts have set a high threshold for finding that an executive failed to exercise due care it is a definition that requires gross negligence , a legal standard that essentially requires that the executive be shown to have acted in bad faith or otherwise willfully committed a known misdeed the next time you see a delaware judge , ask how many executives of bailedout institutions have been found to have breached this duty in the wake of the financial crisis the answer will be none the fdic has thus set up a straw man , a definition that appears appropriate but will instead allow the executive to escape a clawback despite its weakness , the fdic proposal still has critics who think the wording is too strong the law firm davis polk wardwell , which represents many large financial institutions , promotes its client memos as cited within the profession as the definitive treatises on their given subjects in a memo on the fdic plan , davis polk calls it unreasonable , exceedingly vague and possibly unconstitutional davis polk also criticizes the rules for failing to reference a legal definition of care like gross negligence perhaps davis polk is performing a public service by pointing out deficiencies but if you are cynical , you might say the firm is acting for its clients and trying to push the fdic to adopt rules that are more favorable to financial executives and if the fdic sticks to its proposed rules , davis polk will be in a good position to represent these executives if their institutions fail davis polk s comments are emblematic of an unfortunate development the heart of the doddfrank act will be put into action through rulemaking by various agencies few people have the motivation to keep track of the estimated 243 administrative rules required by doddfrank the financial industry and its representatives are the exception the result can be seen in the comments on the first iteration of the fdic s rules covering the procedures for resolution of toobigtofail institutions twentyeight of 35 comment letters by my count were from the financial industry , and the fdic met personally with bank of america , metlife and financial services representatives , which included davis polk there were no meetings with public interest groups with only one voice speaking , the rules are bound to be biased , however unintentionally , to the financial industry s favor what to do \? first , systemically important financial institutions are different from other corporations executives and directors of these institutions probably enjoy a federal too big to fail subsidy because of this , if they engage in excessive risktaking and fail , they should be automatically penalized whether or not their conduct met a legal standard of care like negligence big financial institutions will complain that this will mean that they will be unable to recruit executives or board members but berkshire hathaway seems to have no problem having bill gates as a director even though the company declined to obtain insurance for directors and officers , which leaves them personally liable if they are found to have breached their fiduciary duty moreover , compensation for financial services executives remains quite high if executives are going to make tens of millions of dollars a year should n't they be penalized if their institution fails \? second , the substantial responsibility term used in the doddfrank act is not a legal standard of care , and the fdic should say so explicitly congress almost certainly meant this to refer to a person who was part of the decisionmaking process of the institution in this case , the board , the chief executive and chief financial officer are clearly substantially responsible if the institution fails , being substantially responsible for its governance there does not need to be financial test or quantitative loss measure as the fdic is considering this would be a simpler and more effective definition for the fdic to use the alternative is to continue a system where executives can take excessive risks to earn outsize gains the executives can then rely on exaggerated legal standards of care to keep their millions and avoid responsibility public interest groups also need to be more engaged in the rulemaking process if these organizations do n't submit comments , why ca n't the fdic and the other rulemaking agencies seek them out \? the heart of doddfrank is about setting the right incentives the cynical question is whether the fdic is catering to the right ones this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print drawing \( drawing by harry campbell \)
with tax day fast approaching , many americans are thinking hard , and perhaps a little creatively , about finding deductions to help lower their tax bills nobody , after all , likes paying more taxes than they have to so why in the world should we expect the mighty general electric to act any differently \? because it s a giant , profitable multinational corporation \? if anything , the fact that ge is a big company should give it even more incentive than we mere human taxpayers to minimize its tax bill the executives who run america s corporations have a fiduciary duty to maximize profit for their shareholders that s what they 're programmed to do one way to maximize profits is to minimize taxes , something ge does better than just about any other company if i were a ge shareholder , i would be thrilled to learn that its vaunted 1 , 000person tax department is viewed within the company as a profit center yet the article the new york times saying that ge was likely to pay no federal income tax at all in 2010 has landed like a bombshell , arousing the kind of populist outrage that has n't been seen since those derivatives traders at aig got their last big bonuses in responding to the article , ge did not exactly help itself with its defensive tweets and conflicting statements a week ago , a ge spokeswoman told a reporter that ge did not pay us federal income taxes last year because we do n't owe any on monday , its tune changed in , a company spokesman said , we expect to have a small us income tax liability for 2010 whatever the point remains that the company is going to pay little or nothing in federal income taxes for 2010 and the unambiguous reason for this is that ge took full advantage of the various tax loopholes in the us tax code that are available to it would n't you \? the real villain here is n't ge for gaming the corporate tax system rather , the villain is a political system that makes the corporate tax system so easy to game there are two primary reasons why ge s 2010 tax bill is so low the first is pretty straightforward its finance arm , ge capital , lost billions of dollars during the financial crisis like any business entity , it is allowed to use those losses to help reduce its tax bill this is known as a taxloss carryforward , and it is n't remotely controversial the second tax break , though , called the active financing exception , is a whole different kettle of fish according to robert willens , a corporate tax expert , this tax break was first enacted in 1997 it allows companies to avoid paying us taxes on overseas profits if those profits were derived by actively financing some activity or deal \( the rationale is that this is supposed to help equal the playing field with foreign multinationals that get the same tax breaks from their home countries yadda , yadda , yadda \) the active financing exception was never supposed to be a permanent part of the tax code indeed , it still is n't but every year or two after the usual campaign contributions and armtwisting it winds up back in the tax code temporarily the treasury now estimates that it costs the government 5 billion a year is ge one of the companies that lobbies for the active financing exception \? you bet it is as willens nicely puts it , they are taking advantage of a loophole they helped create but ge has also taken the next obvious step it has managed , over time , to shift billions of dollars in profits from its us income statement to its overseas income statements would n't you know it \? most of their profits are also financing related there is nothing illegal or even unethical about any of this it s congress the same congress that is now screaming bloody murder about the deficit that has paved the way for ge s tax creativity the corporate income tax rate for american corporations is around 35 percent if you talk to american executives for more than five minutes on the subject , they 'll tell you it s too high andrew liveris , the chairman and chief executive of dow chemical , claims in his new book , make it in america , that the us has the secondhighest corporate tax rate in the world a lower tax rate , he argues , could help spur a manufacturing revival in america and , maybe , just maybe , if american multinationals actually paid 35 percent of their profits in taxes , he might have a case but it s not just ge none of them do mr willens told me that the typical multinational pays about half the stated tax rate as for ge , it says that its worldwide tax burden for 2010 was far lower than that 74 percent the bonuses should be pretty good this year in the ge tax department
brandon dubinsky is getting the playing time and responsibility a team s leading scorer deserves but as the rangers enter game 3 of their firstround playoff series against washington on sunday , dubinsky will need to put the first two games in his rearview mirror dubinsky was on the ice for all three of the capitals evenstrength goals this series , which they lead by two games to none this includes the overtime goal by alexander semin in game 1 on wednesday , when all three rangers forwards prematurely left the defensive zone , stranding defenseman marc staal , who turned over the puck dubinsky received the most ice time among rangers forwards over the two games after playing 26 14 on wednesday , dubinsky had 21 minutes in the 20 loss in washington in game 2 on friday , more than twice the playing time of forwards chris drury , wojtek wolski , sean avery and artem anisimov but dubinsky has only three shots on goal in the series , has won just 36 percent of his faceoffs and has not been the physical , energetic presence his coaches have come to rely on in a discussion with reporters on saturday after a brief practice at the team s training center in greenburgh , ny , dubinsky spoke of the need for his team to stay positive and keep our confidence he called for the rangers to play a more forceful game instead of cycling the puck to death , dubinsky said , we need to get to the net dubinsky was then asked if he needed to make adjustments to his own play , especially since the newlook capitals have improved their team defense i have to make sure i m harder on the puck , said dubinsky , a fourthyear forward who will turn 25 on april 29 i have to be much more aggressive i have to play more in the dirty areas he praised washington s rookie goaltender , michal neuvirth , who has allowed one goal over the two games but dubinsky wants to make neuvirth s job more challenging i don t think he s seen enough rubber , dubinsky said i don t think he s seen enough traffic dubinsky is far from the only culprit in the rangers failures so far it would be stretching to declare any rangers forward as a standout in the two games in washington but the rangers need more from dubinsky , who led the team in goals \( 24 \) and points \( 54 \) in the regular season the rangers are counting , in part , on a positive change in atmosphere at madison square garden for game 3 on sunday afternoon to ignite their offense we need a good start , rangers coach john tortorella said hopefully we get the building behind us , and some guys relax a little bit , and we find our way it s not so much mistakes , but trying to get ourselves on track offensively , trying to release some of the pressure there i think we have defended well , but we re not creating enough offensively it s a matter of confidence it s spread throughout our offense we ve been down this road before where we ve struggled scoring goals , and we ve bounced out of it hopefully , tomorrow we find a way it will be easier if dubinsky takes the lead notes tortorella said his 20man lineup would most likely be the same sunday as it was for game 2 , but his line combinations were not set during the 30minute practice i don t think the personnel will change , but we may change things , as far as lines , he said after the workout , rangers forwards said they had yet to be told the identity of their linemates tortorella also acknowledged that he may make some alterations to his club s struggling power play unit
chicago , the governor turned prisoner turned reality television star turned radio talk show host , is scheduled to get a new trial starting as early as wednesday , eight months after proceedings ended with a jury divided on most of the corruption counts against him for some chicagoans , fatigued by the former governor s often circuslike legal travails , the notion of a new trial inspired only shrugs this week yes , they explained , mr blagojevich , whose political unraveling had mortified an entire state and brought government to a standstill , ought to be tried on charges that he tried to sell the united states senate seat that once belonged to but no , they did not really care to watch it not again for some in this state s democratleaning political universe , the worries and threats of such a trial against a fellow democrat also seemed to have faded the election of gov patrick j quinn , who served as lieutenant governor during mr blagojevich s administration , was sealed last fall and democrats held onto their control of both chambers of the state legislature still , the possibility that new details might emerge of mr blagojevich s political dealings and from his phone conversations , secretly recorded by federal authorities , posed risks a new trial and mr blagojevich s return to the headlines certainly were not part of the inauguration script for , a fellow democrat and a former white house chief of staff who takes over as mayor of chicago next month mr emanuel , who had telephone conversations with mr blagojevich and with mr blagojevich s chief of staff shortly after mr obama s election as president in 2008 , received a subpoena to appear at mr blagojevich s first trial but was never called to testify a white house report found that mr emanuel had indeed provided the names of some possible replacements to fill the senate seat mr obama would be giving up \( an appointment assigned , by law , to the governor \) but the report said he did not discuss governor blagojevich s getting anything in exchange for appointing a particular person yet , if mr blagojevich , 54 , a former member of congress and of the legislature , has shown anything since his arrest at his north side home in december 2008 and his impeachment , it is that he defies the predictable behavior of a criminal suspect \( since his troubles , he has sold his autograph at a , at a block party and in a commercial \) you do n't know what he s going to say , said kent redfield , a political scientist at the university of illinois if blagojevich takes the stand this time , he could dirty some people up if anybody has vulnerability to that , it s probably emanuel some grumble about the new trial as a rerun , though it will look different mr blagojevich s legal team has shrunk the charges have shrunk a bit , too after a jury deadlocked on 23 of 24 counts against him last august , prosecutors streamlined the case to 20 counts , including attempted extortion and bribery , the most serious counts carrying maximum penalties of 20 years in prison mr blagojevich s first jury convicted him of one of the least serious charges lying to federal agents , a conviction that could carry up to five years in prison some people are hoping that the initial fury does n't fade entirely it s understandable that people sort of want him to just disappear , said cindi canary , director of the , which has pressed for campaign finance reporting and increased access to public records what concerns me is that there s a sense on the part of some that this incredible outrage has died down , so let s just edge back a bit on reforms
6 28 pm updated one year into its tenure , the mets' new front office is continuing to make emphatic moves in recent weeks , the team announced that terry collins , who recently completed his first season as manager , would be kept on through the 2013 season , and revealed that major alterations to the dimensions of their home stadium , citi field , were likely to be forthcoming and on wednesday , the team announced that ken oberkfell , the bench coach chip hale , the thirdbase coach mookie wilson , the firstbase coach and jon debus , the bullpen coach would not return to those roles for the 2012 season terry and i did sit down and talked about the coaching staff , anticipated the possible loss of chip hale , and for a variety of reasons decided that some changes needed to be made , general manager sandy alderson said wednesday hale declined an offer to remain with the club , and shortly after the mets' announcement , the oakland athletics said they had signed him to a twoyear contract to be their bench coach hale worked with a s manager bob melvin when the two were with the arizona diamondbacks and is native of san jose , calif wilson and debus were offered unspecified positions with the club oberkfell was not tim teufel , who managed the organization s class aaa team in buffalo , will become the mets' thirdbase coach ricky bones , the pitching coach in buffalo , will become the mets' bullpen coach alderson said the other staff additions would be announced in the coming weeks sometimes changes are made for individual reasons , and sometimes they are made for the overall composition of the staff and how it fits together , alderson said for the bench coach job , alderson and collins said they wanted someone with more experience coaching at the major league level oberkfell had served the organization in a variety of capacities , generally in the minor leagues , before becoming the bench coach last season collins said , one of the qualities i 'd be looking for is a guy who s had some experience in that role , as a bench coach , who s done it before at our level , perhaps a guy who has some familiarity with the league and the majority of players that have been in the major leagues for a while the mets bullpen has been under the spotlight after a disastrous showing this year , and alderson said he thought the coaching role there would be better served by someone who has a pitching background , unlike debus , who had none wilson , meanwhile , served as the outfield and baserunning instructors , two areas for the mets that also left much to be desired mookie was responsible for the outfield and base running , and it s not a criticism necessarily of his work in those two areas , but we just felt that mookie might actually be more valuable to us in some other capacity in the organization , alderson said the two coaches that have the highest profile on the staff dave hudgens , the hitting coach , and dan warthen , the pitching coach will remain unchanged hudgens has another year on his contract warthen , a holdover from the previous administration , impressed alderson and collins with his demeanor and work ethic he has a great relationship with our pitching staff , collins said of warthen i watched him prepare on a daily basis and come up with a plan that , when executed , worked this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
marilyn michaels , a singer and comedian , wrote a theater talkback post last week with suggestions for the people who will be casting the demanding role of fanny brice in the coming revival of funny girl ms michaels , who played fanny in the national touring production after barbra streisand originated the role on broadway in 1964 , wrote that the character demands not only a great voice but also a solid understanding of a certain kind of humor fanny brice was a comedienne who understood the yiddish dialect she got her start in burlesque , and created her character strongly based on her jewish roots any actress playing her need not necessarily be jewish , but must possess a genuine ear for jewish cadences , along with the timing and ability to finesse the great comic scenes so who should play fanny \? readers offered wideranging suggestions , from theater insiders like lea michele , idina menzel and sutton foster to outsidethebox choices like lady gaga , sarah silverman and fran drescher following are excerpts from comments on the artsbeat blog  the name that generated some of the most interest was lea michele \( glee \) , who performed some would say auditioned with the number don t rain on my parade at the 2010 tony awards ceremony one reader wrote lea michele has the voice , the nose , the yiddishkeit , the italian bel canto , the stage presence , and the comedic and acting chops \( she deserved a tony for her lead role in spring awakening \) she ll put tocheses in the seats , sacramento , calif another actress who was also mentioned several times was leslie kritzer \( a catered affair \) , known for being a brassy comedian she s a true broadway baby , she s got the vocal chops , she s a brilliant comedienne and a talented actress she knows how to embody a character and make em laugh at the same time i really hope broadway won t look to hollywood on this one , but will give one of its own the spotlight , new york another contender was idina menzel \( wicked \) , who sang don t rain on my parade when ms streisand received the kennedy center honor in 2008  if you re questioning idina menzel s comedic abilities timing , you ve yet to experience her outside a theater performance i ve seen her in concert many times , and she leaves the audience in absolute stitches i say a for that choice ! but would she take the role \? she says she s not a revival girl and has given up on the chance to play funny girl , newark lady gaga , known for her musical theatricality , if not for musical theater , got a few votes lady gaga is an interesting choice she s got the technical vocal skill and certainly has the anythingforattention personality but we ve only ever seen her playing one role , so who knows how good she d be at comedy \? , atlanta another unlikely name that kept popping up was nina arianda \( venus in fur \) , an actress known for her way around comedy \( she received a tony nomination this year for playing billie in the revival of born yesterday \) , but not broadway musicals i adore nina arianda and would gladly see her in the role i think if she could sing it , she d be great , new york if she can t sing , teach her , new york a few readers suggested actresses who at one point in their careers would have been good for the part twentyfive years ago , bernadette peters would have nailed it , but she was then occupied \( and rightfully so \) with sondheim s sunday in the park with george and later into the woods i agree that donna murphy would have been perfect a decade ago , broomall , pa because of the inevitable streisand comparisons , i say go another direction completely a woman of color let s face it , whitney houston in her first decade had the pipes ! , los angeles at least one reader suggested none of the above  the new fanny should be a complete unknown who will come from an open casting call she should be a triple threat whomever is chosen will become a brand new broadway star , los angeles who do you think would be right for the role of fanny brice \? post your comments here
, the 19thcentury texas justice of the peace and saloonkeeper , called himself the law west of the pecos not until the 1960s was judge bean s legend challenged by billy sol estes mr estes was a gladhanding wheelerdealer who used cash from his 100 million agricultural empire to practically purchase the town of pecos , buying up businesses ranging from a tractor dealership to a funeral home mr estes had two planes , a barbecue pit big enough for 10 sizzling steers and decidedly nonindigenous palm trees in his front yard a monkey climbed the trees until he got mumps mr estes was also well connected politically , boasting that the president of the united states took his calls on his wall at the time were autographed pictures of president john f kennedy and a longtime friend , vice president  in , population 12 , 728 then , mr estes essentially ruled until a 29yearold journalist named oscar griffin jr toppled him mr griffin , who died on nov 23 at 78 , was the city editor of a semiweekly pecos newspaper that competed fiercely with a daily paper owned by none other than mr estes on a fiveperson news staff , mr griffin was by necessity a jack of all trades , as much reporter as editor and it was as a reporter that he brought down mr estes , unraveling an elaborate fraud scheme in four that earned mr griffin and his little newspaper , the pecos independent and enterprise , a in 1963 for distinguished local reporting the series , which was as understated and meticulous as mr griffin and took months to prepare , at first caused no particular fuss or fanfare in pecos the articles carried no byline , ran under headlines smaller than those for the major articles and did not even mention mr estes by name but their description of how that businessman masterminded a byzantine scheme to borrow money using nonexistent storage tanks as collateral caught the attention of the fbi congressional hearings into this and other estes flimflams led to the highest levels of the kennedy administration , particularly johnson , who had been a business associate of mr estes s in several ventures some histories say the vice president tried to help mr estes in questionable dealings with the agriculture department that emerged after mr griffin exposed the tank fraud some say kennedy may have considered dropping johnson from his ticket in 1964 , partly because of the johnsonestes connection in 1963 , mr estes was convicted of a battery of fraud charges by federal and state courts and was sentenced to 24 years in prison \( the united states supreme court overturned the state conviction on the ground that television and radio coverage of his pretrial hearing had violated his rights \) after six years in prison , mr estes was released on parole in 1971 eight years later , he was convicted of other fraud charges and served four more years as the estes story unfolded and the national news media picked up on it , mr estes s supporters outnumbered his detractors in pecos , nestled at the juncture of the pecos river and the old comanche trail you have to remember that billy sol was like god in this town , one man told the new york times in 1962 , adding , anyone opposed to him might just as well pack up their bags and leave town the episode began in 1961 , when dr john dunn , a physician who bought the independent the year before with three partners , grew suspicious of mr estes s maneuvers dr dunn s mother , who ran a retail credit shop , had told him of the unusual number of mortgages being carried by farmers dealing with mr estes dr dunn soon discovered that mr estes had borrowed 24 million 180 million in today s dollars using as collateral fertilizer tanks that turned out not to exist mr estes had persuaded farmers in a cottongrowing area to pretend to buy tanks by taking out mortgages on them he offered the farmers 10 percent of the purchase price in effect , something for nothing dr dunn told the fbi , but federal agents found no violation of banking laws before long dr dunn sold his interest in the paper and turned over his material on the estes case to the independent mr griffin said he first became suspicious of mr estes s easymoney scheme when he overheard farmers talking in a small cafe it s like pennies from heaven , he quoted one as saying , recounting the case in an interview with united press international in 1962 in pursuing the estes story mr griffin was taking on a competitor mr estes started his newspaper in august 1961 after the independent refused to back him as a candidate for the local school board mr estes s paper slashed advertising rates to force the independent out of business and warned advertisers to avoid it the strategy appeared to be working the independent cut its editorial staff from five to two the independent s trump card was mr griffin s investigative series , which came out in february and march 1962 mr estes was arrested on march 29 in addition to the fertilizer tank scam , he was convicted of defrauding the federal government s grain storage program in a scheme that in one instance involved taking three federal agriculture officials on a shopping spree at the neiman marcus store in dallas the day before mr estes was arrested , mr griffin said he went to see him and asked him point blank if the fertilizer tanks existed he told me that there were n't as many tanks as the mortgages showed , mr griffin wrote that sure was the understatement of the year mr estes , now 86 , still nurses hard feelings about mr griffin , the reporter who helped put him in jail it s a good riddance that he left this world , mr estes said friday in a brief telephone interview oscar o'neal griffin jr was born in daisetta , tex , on april 28 , 1933 he served in the army in the 1950s , graduated from the university of texas in 1958 and worked at several other small texas papers before joining the independent after his series appeared , he joined the houston chronicle in 1962 and covered both the kennedy and johnson administrations he was later a spokesman for the federal transportation department , worked at small texas oil companies and earned an mba from harvard business school his family said he died of cancer in new waverly , tex , where he lived mr griffin is survived by his wife of 56 years , the former patricia lamb a brother , red a sister , peggy marino three daughters , gwendolyn pryor , amanda ward and marguerite griffin a son , gregory and seven grandchildren the independent not only got the goods on mr estes it also defeated his newspaper , the pecos daily news , which mr estes had started in the hope of grinding the independent out of existence after the scandal broke , the daily news went into receivership \( the independent survives as \)
augusta , ga with highdefinition television and superslowmotion replays increasingly playing a role in how golf s rules are implemented , the sport s governing bodies took a step back thursday , revising a rule so that some golfers in unique situations would be only penalized , not disqualified at issue is the occasion when a player is not aware he has breached a rule and could not reasonably be expected to have known recently , with the use of advanced video technologies , minor breaches of the rules have been discovered on television in the past , a player who signed a scorecard without applying the appropriate penalty was disqualified under the new interpretation , the player would still receive the penalty but not a disqualification this is a solution to a modern phenomenon that the rules never contemplated , said mike davis , executive director of the united states golf association these are things that could not happen in daytoday competition and could n't be discovered without specialized cameras that zoom in and make a golf ball look the size of a basketball earlier this year , padraig harrington was disqualified after he shot an openinground 65 at the abu dhabi championship when a slowmotion replay on highdefinition television revealed that his ball moved ever so slightly as he was removing his ball mark on the green harrington was unaware the ball moved and none of his playing partners or anyone else on the green reported the ball moving if they had , a twostroke penalty should have been assessed because the rules violation was not assessed at the time , harrington signed an incorrect scorecard , which led to a disqualification with thursday s change , which was announced just before the first round of the masters and goes into effect immediately , harrington would still have two shots added to his score but could have continued to play another celebrated case this year involved camilo villegas , who was disqualified for signing an incorrect card after a television viewer noticed he had tamped down a divot near where his ball was rolling down a slope villegas would still be disqualified under the new rule because the rules violation in this case was for not knowing a rule ignorance of the rules is not what this interpretation applies to , peter dawson , chief executive of the scotlandbased ra , which along with the usga announced the new rule it is for a limited number of circumstances we do n't think it will arise too often but we were troubled by disproportionate disqualification penalties for small breaches of the rules the change is not actually to the rules of golf , but to the large book of decisions on the rules that guides officials in specific cases the new interpretation is of decision 337 45 and in practice it gives officials far greater latitude when determining if a player should be disqualified this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
that bears team that absorbed an from the detroit lions on monday has as much chance of making the nfl playoffs as what \? ok , as much chance as the as their general manager wait , that s also happening \? sure , and ron zook s wellschooled  it is \? i'm thinking i should have passed on that last round when some old buddies were in town the other night chicago sports can be confusing in the best of times but none of this makes any sense what was particularly unsettling about the bears' loss was how bad they looked with jay cutler playing very well cutler , the whippingboy quarterback , put up credible numbers against a pass rush out to decapitate him , at times neutralizing it by being resourceful , nimble and tough imagine how good he 'd be behind an offensive line that can protect him understanding the snap count would be a start or with a goto receiver whose size and speed suggest something more than a volkswagen beetle cutler and matt forte aside , the bears looked as clueless and inept as they routinely did in the prepayton '70s remember kent nix \? the coaching staff bears some of the responsibility lovie smith and his crew had to know the lions' 40 start and first monday night appearance in a decade would have the ford field crowd amped up and fratparty boisterous the bears responded with nine falsestart penalties how s that for preparation \? putting points on the board even 3 points is one way of quieting a rambunctious crowd the bears had a chance to score first late in the first quarter , but they disdained a 43yard field goal attempt and went for the first down on fourthandone they got smothered , but not before burning their final timeout of the half and instead of calming down , the crowd got charged up enough for a virtual storming of the field , crazed vigilantes with lanterns and pitchforks and plenty of beer good luck , jay here s a sobering thought the lovie smith bears have always been a defenseoriented team that prides itself on a tenacious refusal to surrender a big play the lions gashed that defense for 73 and 88yard touchdowns one week earlier , carolina rolled up 543 yards behind a rookie quarterback , cam newton the week before that , aaron rodgers could have sampled the united club s lunch buffet while waiting for his receivers to break free on a 297yard , threetouchdown afternoon matt ryan and drew brees combined for 589 passing yards in weeks 1 and 2 if the bears are not a good defensive team , they 're not a good team , period too flawed to make the playoffs \? maybe not they 're not in the packers' class , obviously or new orleans' , and probably not the lions' but who else in the nfc is really scary \? san francisco is 41 on the manic energy of firstyear coach jim harbaugh let s see if that survives a season philadelphia s dream team splurge looks like the worst expenditure of freeagent money since the white sox fell for adam dunn atlanta \? scuffling already lost to the bears tampa bay \? the bucs just took a 413 whomping from the 49ers the cowboys , redskins and giants \? throw a blanket over them they 're the same team with winnable games against the vikings and bucs up next , the bears could get to 43 at their bye week then it s back to teasing us sort of like the cubs' pursuit of theo epstein , but with less satisfying results yes , epstein , the boywonder general manager , delivered two world series titles in four years to a boston franchise that had been 86 years without one , but if those salary figures being tossed around are accurate , you 'd think epstein had invented baseball he did n't , but he s widely credited with perfecting the moneyball version , combining ample resources and numbersdriven smarts that s the brand the tom ricketts cubs intend to play , and thus the attraction turns out it was mutual the red sox have become the new england yankees every year they do n't win is deemed a failure , with this year s 720 collapse just unacceptable expectations like that wear on a man the cubs , by comparison , are a softball team at the company picnic the dreamiest chatter depicts epstein as the closer on a wrigley field ballpark deal , as if he 'd been out there in hardhat and boots overseeing the muchadmired fenway renovations not really epstein is a baseball guy , and a good one , though hardly perfect the red sox are two years without a playoff berth , and they 'd probably take al soriano s contract for john lackey s equally bad one , or carl crawford s what the cubs want from epstein is the eye for talent and developmental knowhow that brought dustin pedroia , jon lester , jacoby ellsbury and other homegrown prospects to boston that sort of package does n't arrive via overnight mail the cubs have some work to do before they 're any good , even if epstein shows up with a couple of starting pitchers and an outfield bat with some pop in tow terry francona \? ryne sandberg \? interesting either way the question then is who gets the lake named after him if the cubs finally win
five chineseamericans are among the candidates on the mayoral ballot in tuesday s election ed lee , interim mayor david chiu , president of the board of supervisors phil ting , san francisco s assessorrecorder and leland yee , state senator , share their thoughts on the history and progress of the chineseamerican community in san francisco in january , ed lee became an instant icon for san francisco s chinese after the board of supervisors appointed him , the littleknown city administrator , as interim mayor he is the first chineseamerican to hold the city s highest office i went to over 150 chinese new year events , mr lee said , and people attended in extraordinary numbers whether i was appointed or elected , it did n't make a difference mr lee , 59 , grew up in seattle , one of six children of a restaurant owner with roots in the taishan region of china san francisco had laws on the books that prevented chinese immigrants from voting , from owning property , he said there were physical and social restrictions and hurt placed on coolies he added that even his mother and father faced discrimination when we were growing up , getting cursed by his white customers mr lee began his career as a tenants' rights lawyer and came to political maturity steeped in the world of chinatown nonprofits his opponents now accuse some of those groups of illegally helping his campaign none of the nonprofits should be involved in political dealings , mr lee said but if they 're drawn into it , it s because of the political knives of candidates who want to make an association look bad leland yee has been in the spotlight in the final weeks of the mayoral race for leveling a series of highprofile attacks against ed lee and mr lee s supporters mr yee , a state senator , has also been criticized as running a negative campaign recently , a group of the mayor s prominent supporters held a news conference to chastise mr yee s campaign after he released a 53page satirical biography of mr lee that included accusations that mr lee s supporters committed voter fraud and laundered money , allegations that mr lee has distanced himself from but mr yee , 63 , the son of immigrants from the taishan region who speaks cantonese and who received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university , is unfazed on the campaign trail he glides through chinatown , the richmond and the excelsior with the familiarity of a veteran legislator who has a 21year winning streak in local races i 've fought all my life to encourage the chinese to vote , he said these issues that i 've raised are about the integrity of the chinese vote mr yee said he had attracted criticism because he had not been willing to associate himself with power brokers you 're not in one camp versus another , he said the only camp you 're in is the people s camp david chiu , president of the san francisco board of supervisors , sees himself as part of a new wave of asianamerican leaders that includes his fellow candidates phil ting and jeff adachi freed from the language constraints that limited the career choices of their parents , mr chiu and others in his generation took up civil rights work and eventually ended up in san francisco politics the son of a doctor , mr chiu , 42 , grew up in boston and entered harvard as a premed student he changed his concentration to government in his second year after protesting a hate crime on another boston campus with a lot of patterns , the first generation goes into occupations and professions that they could easily break into , he said the second generation and their children , who are more assimilated , have more opportunities mr chiu came to san francisco in 1996 to work as a staff attorney at the lawyers' committee for civil rights under law , representing mostly latino restaurant workers in the mission i represent a younger generation that grew up in an era when people of different backgrounds are comfortable interacting with each other , mr chiu said it s reflective of a postobama era , where voters are finally able to look beyond the race of a candidate phil ting , 42 , the city s assessorrecorder , has

six critics examine the place of criticism in the age of instant , ubiquitous opinion our jan 2 issue on why criticism matters drew a large number of letters from readers , and we wanted to share more than the few we were able to publish in print the letters here touch on several themes the critic s ability to connect with readers , the writings of james joyce and northrop frye , and the contributions of contemporary critics  to the editor thank you for an enlightening collection of essays on literary criticism \( why criticism matters , jan 2 \) , a genre with which i am poorly acquainted as a reader of nonfiction , i see reviews of books i may choose to read and often find them helpful for example , sean wilentz s review of tocqueville s discovery of america , by leo damrosch , in the american prospect it represents the excellence described by your contributors and not the crowdsourcing commentary of amateur readers and yes , i bought the book among all the ideas offered by your contributors , the most salient was katie roiphe s on the desirability , even the necessity , for the critic to write well perhaps that s why successful writers make the best critics beyond excellence and clarity of prose , the critic must also write for us the average , nonprofessional , generally educated reader the critic must not make himself the subject of his craft , but rather an enabler for the less sophisticated reader but heaven forbid do not venture into such grandiose verbosity as to lose readers i recall listening to john leonard s televised reviews on cbs sunday morning my wife and i often wondered , does even he understand what he just said \? likewise , we often attended plays or symphonies , and after reading critics reviews thought , did they attend the same performance we did \? the reader s experience may be in fields apart from the writer s , and we may enjoy what they create at different levels of comprehension , but they should rejoice that we partake of what they offer p ridgway gilmer jr houston  to the editor in why criticism matters , it is perhaps not surprising that two of the six essayists mention james joyce , and that his major works are specifically cited as joyce s biographer richard ellmann notes in his introduction to the critical writings of james joyce joyce wrote a good deal of criticism and broadened the boundaries of his novels to make them include criticism a portrait of the artist as a young man contains an aesthetic system , ulysses contains a new and elaborate theory of shakespeare s life and works , and finnegans wake parodies yeats , synge , eliot , wyndham lewis , lewis carroll and others but joyce spent his early years writing formal literary criticism and book reviews for english and italian newspapers he wrote about william blake s poetry and daniel defoe s robinson crusoe , among other literature in a 1903 review , discussing henrik ibsen s plays cataline , peer gynt and hedda gabler , joyce wrote imagination has the quality of a fluid , and it must be held firmly , lest it become vague , and delicately , that it may lose none of its magical powers and ibsen has united with his strong , ample , imaginative faculty a preoccupation with the things present to him perhaps in time , even the professional critic , accepting the best of the social dramas for what they are the most excellent examples of skill and intellectual selfpossession will make this union a truism of professional criticism ellmann wrote if joyce did not call himself a critic , it was by choice not incapacity the criticism of writers like henry james or thomas mann attracts us mainly because of what they reveal of other writers joyce s criticism is important for what it reveals about joyce richard j gerber lake peekskill , ny the author is a regular contributor to the james joyce quarterly  to the editor as the blizzard began dec 26 , i settled in with the book review , delivered to us expat new yorkers in rhode island dale peck s introduction of thomas bernhard \( the alienator \) was engrossing , but i was disappointed to read that western literature can be divided into two traditions the democratic and the alienating fast forward to the jan 2 issue on why criticism matters , and my disappointment grew into dismay when i found no mention of the great canadian critic northrop frye and the anatomy of criticism with frye s assistance , peck would have had no trouble characterizing achilles in frye s anatomy , stephen burn would find the larger frames than the personal that might be brought to bear in reviews , with more effort taken to think of genres within less narrow , rigid borders for decades , my former students found that professors reacted with surprise and approval when frye was invoked in discussion and quoted in their essays yet none of them assigned any frye since i had first read frye on william blake in fearful symmetry en route to my ma , no other writer has been a more helpful guide if you want to be able to think and talk about what you read or see , there s nothing like the anatomy of criticism for scope , detail and clarity as a teacher , i began a semester with italo calvino s shortstory collection cosmicomics , asking students to write whatever they could about it , which was almost nothing by course s end , i asked them to reread the story and rewrite their essays their empowerment by frye was always impressive the snow is melting , but we re still in for months more of the season of irony come spring and comedy , we ll revel again summer is romance , and fall is tragedy i heartily agree that criticism matters and hope more readers will find the magus , northrop frye lois shapley bassen lincoln , ri  to the editor , jennifer b mcdonald , in masters of the form \( jan 2 \) , offers an array of salient quotations on literary criticism by many of the important practitioners unfortunately , the list ends with alfred kazin in 1960 and is silent on the many contemporary critics who have dealt with the rise of postmodern literary theory terry eagleton , fredric jameson , susan sontag and bell hooks , to name a few these writers have attempted to deal with the difficulties presented by deconstruction and poststructuralism in general that created a revolution in critical theory since the 70s also , it is interesting that , of all the quotations cited , none are by women corey postiglione chicago the writer is an associate professor of art history and critical theory at columbia college chicago  to the editor the most significant thing about the feature on why criticism matters is the title the new york times would never find it necessary to publish an article on why science , mathematics , medicine , music or art matters the need to explain why criticism matters emphasizes as clearly as possible the fact that it doesn t shalom rackovsky rochester  to the editor authors and reviewers receive praise all the time , but the cover of the jan 2 book review shows that your graphics and layout designers deserve their share what first appears to be an intriguing abstract design at second glance turns out to be a meaningful message about the content of the issue it s worth framing as an art object kudos to the design staff larry schlack kalamazoo , mich  to the editors this may sound dramatic , but when i first saw the book review s selection of essays on literary criticism , i felt one of those irregular tremors of the heart if that isn t enough to show someone , somewhere , that the literary world is still turning , then i m afraid there s nothing to be done my gratitude for these essays goes beyond expression , but i think i ll give it a shot as an aspiring writer and passionate reader , i used to find myself on the more fatalistic side of the discourse on modern literature faulkner , eliot , proust , joyce , hemingway , nabokov if there s anything they impart upon us , it s that their greatness cannot be surpassed , especially in the way we re taught to understand their work a student of literature is witness to myriad hero worshipers , and so a 22yearold with a ba in english is a jaded misanthrope who mourns at the mention of contemporary literature the great writers are dead and the great critics are dead or dying nobody reads anymore our most popular authors are stephenie meyer and dan brown the 22yearold college graduate becomes despondent and hopeless and , more than anything , unbearably resentful common sense would indicate that he is lonely , that the appearance of likeminded individuals and hero worshipers would elicit some kind of hope , would feed that little blue flame within him instead critics like joseph epstein \( ts eliot and the demise of the literary culture \) and harold bloom are alienating defeatist commiseration is still defeatist i often asked myself the point of being passionate in the face of a declining culture or even writing when there s no one left to read then at some point , i realized that i was reading , that my friends were reading , that the seething mass of the internet was reading i m not 22 anymore and over the last few years i ve learned that being passionate about literature doesn t necessitate that one remain lonely and jaded these essays have reaffirmed my belief that literature is far from dead just as today s novelists juxtapose their elements be they the two parts to a metaphor , protagonist and antagonist , or past and present today s critics are juxtaposing our literature against the vast machine of modern culture more and more i realize there is no straight shot of communication from writer to reader instead literature is an interconnected web on which we all are flies , and with each twitch of our legs we send vibrations to those nearby as a reader it s my job to send a vibration of my own back to the writer a cultural engine like the internet has made it possible for those vibrations to carry farther and stronger when epstein states that literary culture is shutting down and that what is being created in contemporary novels , poems and plays no longer speaks to the heart or mind , it s very easy to wax nostalgic for a time when every american curled up with a copy of the sound and the fury and felt touched by its deeper meaning today when i walk into a bookstore , i m confronted by mysteries , by romance novels and courtroom dramas is this what our culture has become \? of course not it s what it always has been in faulkner s time the average american preferred a copy of the latest detective novel what we call great literature has always relegated itself to a select handful of readers if anything , that great literature has become more accessible than ever i m happy as we should all be happy to know that there will always be critics and , even more important , readers in short , thank you for sharing patrick nathan minneapolis
most attention on climate science is focused on the new and the provocative , while the picture of growing risk from rising levels of greenhouse gases is best delineated by decades of work that is old and not contentious that makes for a bad fit between this scientific enterprise and the world of public opinion , policy and politics it can also produce a chronic feeling of intellectual whiplash  you can see how this process works in the reactions to two recent research findings focused on resolving how hot the world could get from a given buildup of greenhouse gases the whiplash occurs because science is a stutterstep , hopscotch style journey full of zigs and zags on all kinds of timescales when you put that kind of process in the distorting environment of a policy fight , the temptation to overstate \( in both directions \) is essentially akin to a positive feedback , to adopt the parlance of climate research such has been the case with global warming science for years , as has been discussed since the early days of this blog in relation to hurricanes , frogs , sea ice and other subjects after my first print article describing this phenomenon , in 2008 , curtis brainard , in the columbia journalism review , and dan kulpinski , writing on the earth sky web site , expanded on this theme so here are the two fresh examples how hot \? one was a paper published in science a week ago , by andreas schmittner of oregon state university and colleagues , that generated  cheers from doubters of global warming because the authors concluded the climate was less responsive to a big buildup of greenhouse gases than some previous work had concluded i published a post on the paper at the time , but with a prominent warning about the perils of singlestudy syndrome  there s been a lot of push back from the climate modeling community over the work \( and of course from climate campaigners focused on bombshells and shockers \) at the end of this post you can read some fresh thoughts from scientists , including a measured note from james hansen , the nasa climate scientist and climate campaigner methane time bomb \? there s some torquing , as well , around a new commentary on the measured and projected carbon emissions \( both in methane and carbon dioxide \) from warming , thawing arctic tundra published in this week s issue of nature the article is a statement of concern resulting from a survey of the 41 scientists who comprise the permafrost carbon network it notes the vast scale of the carbon reservoir beneath the tundra in the far north and the centuries of greenhouse gas emissions that could escape on even modest warming trajectories ted schuur , a biologist at the university of florida leading the effort , said the full results of the survey will be submitted for peerreviewed publication in coming months in an interview a couple of days ago , he summarized the sobering news that field work in the last few years has revealed that the reservoir of old carbon is three times larger than older estimates , and other work suggests that it could escape at a faster rate than previously presumed but he also noted that there is no evidence of what some have described as a methane time bomb waiting to be triggered some great unleashing leading , in tippingpoint fashion , toward unstoppable outcomes he noted that while there s a huge amount of carbon in arctic soils and permafrost , we re just talking about a smaller fraction of that pool schuur added that the projected rate of emissions is higher than previously estimated , but not at some runaway rate it s not a time bomb it s an important additional cumulative emissions source , he told me the big concern , he said , remains the pace of emissions of greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels and destroying forests this is relevant to policy discussions , because the view on arctic tundra fits as with so many other parts of the climate question the overall conclusion that rising temperatures result in rising impacts on systems and resources that matter to people it s also important to note that , in contrast to the climate sensitivity question which has been hashed out for four decades , the study of the response of arctic lands to sustained warming is in its early days to make that point , schuur sent me a graph \( he s published an earlier version this is updated \) showing the spike in published work mentioning permafrost and carbon the sensitive question here s a bit more depth on the new study of the responsiveness of climate to a big buildup of carbon dioxide climate sensitivity is the term that has evolved to describe a critical , and enduring , question at the heart of concerns over a buildup of greenhouse gases how much warming , on short and long time scales , will come from a doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide that prevailed in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution got into high gear \( 280 parts per million \) the level is fast approaching 400 and , without big changes in trajectories for emissions , could easily pass 560 well before this century is out in the new paper , the authors who focused on greenhouse clues from past cold spells went out of their way to stress the tentative nature of their conclusions , but such nuance doesn t always make it into news releases and journal summaries criticism has come on two fronts from scientists involved in other lines of research giving higher odds to hotter outcomes and from others who say the robustness of midrange sensitivity is already well established the bottom line , from my reading of the arguments , is that there are slim chances there will ever be an aha moment here definitively trimming the hottest end of the curve of possible heating from a greenhouse buildup when faced with durable uncertainty on many fronts in the modeling of the atmosphere , in data delineating past climate changes , and more pushing ever harder to boost clarity may be scientifically important but is not likely to be very relevant outside a small circle of theorists and of course the sensitivity issue is just about the basic climate response the full extent of warming will also be shaped by the added influence of biologybased factors like those emissions from the arctic there , at least , the recent burst of research in the field and labs doesn t point to a monster behind the door , to reprise a phrase from steve pacala of princeton describing the consequential but uncertain risks of nudging a big system in novel ways i agree with gavin schmidt of nasa and realclimate that there s little relevance of the enduring climate sensitivity question to public policy in a phone chat , he said that arguments about specific levels of climate sensitivity , or specific goals for carbon dioxide concentrations , have little meaning as long as the world is not slowing down from its accelerating path on emissions we touched on analogies , as i ve been apt to do of late schmidt rolled out a favorite you ve set out on a road trip to california and people sitting in the back of the car are arguing about where you re going to park when you get to the bay area but in the meantime we re traveling toward maine here s the roundup of reactions to the schmittner et al paper on climate sensitivity much of the discussion is technical , but i promised the scientists i would post their views in toto , so proceed with that in mind the abbreviation lgm is for the last glacial maximum , the peak of the last ice age i ve inserted a few contextual links for other terms james hansen said the basic findings are in accord with his work , with a few caveats you can read his full contribution here  as part of an email exchange that plays out below , david lea , a paleoclimatologist at the university of california , santa barbara , wrote i think it s a really interesting contribution , and a provocative one the difference between this and prior climate sensitivity studies that used the lgm comes down largely to the estimates of lgm cooling most prior studies used climap \( or some variant \) estimates of lgm cooling of 4 deg c this study quotes an lgm cooling of 22 deg so it s no wonder that the model requires a much lower sensitivity to reproduce the lgm state the difference in the lgm cooling seems to be mostly due to smaller estimates of sst sea surface temperature change \( ie , the new margo reconstruction \) i think this is most clearly seen in fig 2 , which compares the zonal temperature change with various ecs values equilibrium climate sensitivity for the low latitudes , the reconstruction , which in the sh low latitudes would be heavily weighted by ocean cooling , averages about 12 deg c , matching ecs values of 22 , close to the quoted median value in the paper but what s obvious from the plot is that the ecs values cluster together in this latitude band , such that a somewhat greater cooling \( say 3 deg \) is consistent with an ecs value of 37 that s a big change in ecs , and there is substantial evidence from two of the sst proxies mg ca , where a lot of my own work has focused , and alkenone unsaturation for lgm cooling of 3 deg mg ca is shorthand for the reason those cooling estimates don t carry much weight in the schmittner paper is that the margo compilation weights each estimate of lgm sst equally , regardless of proxy fig 4 in the margo \( 2009 \) paper indicates that the low latitude estimates are dominate by foram assemblage estimates which largely show a modest lgm cooling so that seems to be the gist of it if the lgm tropics cooled minimally , then the required ecs is on the low side bump that cooling up by just 115 deg and the required ecs rises rapidly the one other thing i would add is that the mg ca and alkenone unsaturation records show quite clearly in the time domain that systematic glacial cooling occurred throughout the pleistocene that aspect of the proxy records is not captured by a single time slice reconstruction such as the lgm so if there really was minimal tropical cooling , then there would need to be an alternative explanation of why those sst proxy time series show such systematic patterns regardless , of these arguments , i hope , from the societal viewpoint , that the paper s right and ecs is on the low side in this case i ll have to figure out how the proxy measurements we worked so hard on overestimated the lgm cooling anthony j broccoli of rutgers responded i agree with david s comments the estimation of sensitivity in this paper is crucially dependent upon the estimates of glacial cooling the mg ca estimates of tropical ocean cooling would be nearly impossible to reconcile with a global sensitivity of 23 degrees david s comments reminded me of something that suki manabe and i wrote more than 25 years ago in a paper that used climap data in a comparative evaluation of two versions of the 1980svintage gfdl model until this disparity in the estimates of lgm paleoclimate is resolved , it is difficult to use data from the lgm to evaluate differences in low latitude sensitivity between climate models although there has been great progress in developing and applying new proxies , similar words could be written today the differences among proxy reconstructions are still an obstacle when attempting to constrain climate sensitivity more tightly solely on the basis of lgm climate ronald j stouffer of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in princeton , nj , wrote i am surprised by the claim that the probability of high sensitivities can be reduced using these experiments i think that the forcing uncertainties would greatly hinder this analysis given the large and growing \( my opinion \) uncertainty of the aerosol forcing , how can we make meaningful statements about the climate sensitivity from paleoexperiments \? to make such statements wouldn t we have to know the 3d dust field in the lgm and the impact of those aerosols on clouds \( and planetary albedo \) \? we are having a very difficult time doing this for the present day , how can we do this for the lgm \? here s input from gerald meehl , a climate modeler at the national center for atmospheric research i agree with ron there are a lot of aspects that are not known about the lgm on the other hand , the bottom line result isn t that much different from previous estimates this study concludes , in the words of the oregon state news release the closest match , with a much lower degree of uncertainty than most other studies , suggests climate sensitivity is about 24 degrees the most likely value of climate sensitivity from the ar4 the fourth report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change was about 3 degrees so this study more or less confirms that the climate sensitivity is probably in that same neighborhood gabriele c hegerl of the university of edinburgh concurred with meehl and snipped a line from using the past to predict the future , an analysis of the schmittner paper that she wrote with a colleague , tom russon , and which was published in the same issue of science we tried to say it in the perspective the work of schmittner et al demonstrates that climates of the past can provide potentially powerful information to reduce uncertainty in future climate predictions and evaluate the likelihood of climate change that is larger than captured in present models however , given the remaining uncertainties , which the authors discuss in their paper , a firm upper boundary is still elusive raymond t pierrehumbert of the university of chicago and realclimate blog , referrred to the blog post on the study and added some thoughts on a point not emphasized on the blog the lgm again this is the peak of the last ice age gives us some information on how the climate responds to reduced co2 in a cooler world , and that can help evaluate models used to project the future but there are also periods in the past that were warmer than present , and these also provide valuable hints as to climate sensitivity , though the information we have about such times is not as detailed as what we have about the lgm one key period is the pliocene warm period , about 5 million years ago it is estimated that co2 at the time was only moderately greater than preindustrial about 400 ppm , a number we are fast closing in on \( though there is considerable debate about actual pliocene co2 levels \) yet the pliocene world was very different today , with a much warmer northern hemisphere , a deglaciated greenland , episodic deglaciation of the west antarctic ice sheet , and considerably warmer tropical temperatures analysis of the pliocene \( cf the nature geoscience article by lunt et al \) would tend to support total climate sensitivities at or even beyond the high end of the ipcc range \( i make that about 45c for a doubling , extrapolating from lunt s pliocene warming \) put more simply , if a world as different as the pliocene is what ultimately awaits us at a mere 400 ppm , there is good reason to fear where we may be going if we go to , say , 1000 ppm the paleocene eocene thermal maximum , about 55 million years ago , also points to similarly high climate sensitivity none of these events provide a definitive estimate , but they need to be thrown into the mix when trying to decide what the chances are that climate sensitivity is high unless somebody comes up with some reason for discarding these events , it is clearly premature to write off the possibility that climate sensitivity could be near the top of the ipcc range if you haven t had enough , there is much , much more analysis of the schmittner research aggregated at skeptical science
windermere , fla when sean foley was a college golfer , he sometimes exasperated his coach by giving tips to opposing players he was precociously interested in swing theory and swing mechanics , more concerned with how many greens he hit in regulation than with his final score when he was 14 , an obsessive reader of golf instruction books , he was offering unsolicited and possibly incorrect advice to hapless duffers at 16 , he could imitate nick faldo frame by frame on video i was the kid at the driving range who whenever someone was giving a lesson would get as close as he could and just listen , he said recently at the house , in a development on a former citrus grove here , where he lives with his wife and his 3yearold son my friends used to say , you 're paralyzing yourself with all this information' but i was addicted to hitting the ball well that mattered to me more than scoring i was too insecure to be a great competitor i was n't very confident and i was always trying to show people how good i was , which is n't a good motivation for doing anything life is n't about what other people think it s about how you feel about you not surprisingly , foley became not a tour player but something that barely existed when he was growing up the kind of pro professionals go to , a golf guru his clients include stephen ames , hunter mahan , justin rose , sean o'hair and , most famously , , whom he has been coaching since last summer foley s critics , who compare him to a mad scientist tampering with a onceperfect piece of machinery , like to point out that under his tutelage a winless woods has dropped to no 7 from no 1 in the world rankings and has played some of the worst golf of his career the scientist part is n't wrong , exactly on the spectrum of golf instruction , foley belongs at the egghead , theoretical end he is more dave pelz than harvey penick he consults all the time with craig davies , a sports chiropractor , and he believes in trackman a radar device that measures the speed , spin and flight of the golf ball the way a surgeon believes in xrays and mri s his conversation is studded with references to fascial chains and kinesthetic submodalities , and in drills , he likes to trick the brain into creating new neuropathways but he also talks a lot about philosophy \( his major in college \) and clinical psychology in his study there are biographies of gandhi and nelson mandela , and the memoirs of bill and hillary clinton it used to be hard for me to be convergent and to concentrate , he said i'm analytical , very tangential i would n't say i have add that s not a word i would use but i have a very busy mind except for being a little short , foley looks the part of golf guru he has the permanently bronzed skin , the tightfitting golf shirts , the big belt buckle , the perfectly creased slacks but in some ways , he s an anomaly in his profession unlike woods s previous tutors hank haney and butch harmon , who were middleaged , worldly wise and versed in the tightlipped old school , foley is 36 , just a year older than woods , and likes to listen to rap he is simultaneously earnest , disarming and a little brash and he s canadian traces of an ontario accent still creep into some of his vowels , and for all his fame , he has a canadian s habit of selfeffacement if you could just meet his mum and dad for five minutes , you would know everything you need to know about sean , said tom jackson , the president and owner of the core golf academy in florida until about four years ago , foley was practically an unknown in the wider golf world he and his wife were working for jackson , running a school for teenage golfers and serving , in effect , as dorm parents when ames , a pga tour player and fellow canadian , called asking for help with his swing ames was shortly followed by mahan , o'hair , rose and , ultimately , woods , who after parting ways with haney and trying to coach himself imploded at the 2010 wgcbridgestone invitational , shooting 18 over par , and conceded that he needed help though woods does n't remember this , foley says they actually met in the early 1990s , when woods , then a high school senior , gave a clinic at the minority college golf championship he was awesome , foley said i could n't believe the shots he hit foley s father is a scot who grew up in glasgow , and his mother is a west indian from guyana but he went on a golf scholarship to tennessee state , a historically black college , where his coach was catana starks , the first africanamerican woman to coach a men s division i golf team the canadian dollar was worth about 64 cents back then , foley said i was n't interested in school and i'm not good at things i'm not interested in , so my high school record was n't great tennessee state had a division i golf team it was n't a powerhouse , but it was respectable he smiled and added that because of poor play and poor grades , he eventually lost the scholarship pretty good trick , he said you go to college on a full ride and come out owing 40 grand i did n't have that work ethic back then but foley also believes that choosing tennessee state , where he was sometimes shunned by the other students , was the most important decision he ever made i could n't have learned more at harvard , he said even in high school i was interested in dr king and medgar evers and web dubois , and i could understand why a black kid might have a problem with me i could appreciate the punchback i was n't green , exactly , but i went there as a pretty insecure kid , and within a month , i got to the point where i said to myself , you have to be who you are and true to yourself that s a pretty good thing to learn at 19 you ca n't get that in books and so now when people ask me what it s like being tiger s coach and listening to all those terrible things people say , i'm like , whatever it does n't bother me at all foley talks a little too much about the thickness of his skin to be entirely convincing a criticism that clearly rankles is that he is forcing woods to learn a modified version of the stackandtilt system \( in which a righthanded golfer keeps his head over the left side even as he turns away from the ball \) ripped off from its inventors , mike bennett and andy plummer mike and andy , they 're buddies of mine , foley said we talk all the time i'm on the range 10 hours a day and i talk to everyone how is this stealing \? this is about growing the game of golf i 've learned a lot , for example , from a guy named james leitz , a hidden gem down in louisiana none of this was a problem until i started coaching tiger and tried to get him to stop moving his head on the backswing palmer did n't , and neither did nicklaus hogan did n't snead did n't there is n't anyone teaching anything today that guys were n't doing in the '30s , '40s and '50s we have more information on what they were doing and why it s effective , but those guys knew it in a different way talking about working with woods , he said , i'm not na ve we started off at the pga after one of the worst rounds of his career so i knew it would n't be easy but all of the criticism ca n't take away the fact that , just like with hunter and justin and stephen , i'm living the life i envisioned for myself explaining what woods is up against , he offered an anecdote from a few years ago , when his wife , pregnant with their son , was visiting in canada i was playing a lot of golf , shooting 69 , 70 , he said then kate called and said the doctor said there might be a problem i went out the next day and shot 89 obviously , tiger has been through a great deal if people do n't think that s going to affect clarity and affect performance , they 're crazy foley also insisted that woods was making progress i 've seen a ton of improvement in what i want done , he said the critics do n't understand that because they do n't know what they 're looking for it does n't matter he added we 're talking about the golf swing it is n't about child starvation or adolescent education or any of the things that are really important he shrugged what can i do \? it s just the golf swing
sandwich , england an amateur who shoots a 65 in his first british open round , makes the cut with ease and draws praise from none other than tom watson should be a lock for the silver medal awarded to the tournament s leading amateur not so fast tom lewis , the 20yearold englishman in question , followed up that 65 with a 74 and a 76 , and he is now just two shots in front of the american peter uihlein , the only other amateur still in the tournament lewis is at fiveover par with one round to play uihlein , the reigning united states amateur champion , is at seven over after following two 71s with a thirdround 75 to sit tied for 41st uihlein , like lewis , has strong family connections to golf lewis s father is a golf professional uihlein s father , wally , is the chairman and chief executive of the acushnet company , which includes the golf brands titleist and footjoy well , peter is a great player , so no matter what happens tomorrow , hopefully i can play well , and if i don t win , then i don t win , lewis said he deserves whatever he gets hopefully i can win some bigger trophies in my career uihlein , a 21yearold allamerican golfer from oklahoma state , missed the cut at the masters and the united states open this year , but he is playing on the weekend at this major the conversation has shifted quickly here at royal st george s on thursday , it seemed like the early results were confirmation of europe s increased domination of the game and lewis s glittering 65 a big hint that the good times would keep right on rolling but the americans have struck back and now have 10 players in the top 16 heading into sunday , and uihlein now has a chance to snatch the silver medal for the united states , too
an outside lawyer will review allegations that s presidential campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in goods and services from a taxexempt organization founded by his chief of staff , a spokesman for the candidate said wednesday the group , prosperity usa , appears to have paid for plane tickets , chartered planes and computer equipment for friends of herman cain , mr cain s presidential committee , raising the prospect of serious violations of tax and election laws by both mr cain s campaign and the organization the internal documents showing the expenses were first obtained by  as with any suggestions of this type , said j d gordon , mr cain s spokesman , we have asked outside counsel to investigate the milwaukee journal sentinel s suggestions and may comment , if appropriate , when that review is completed mr gordon did not identify the individual or firm that would conduct the review , or say when it would be complete word of the review came as mr cain faced growing accusations this week of sexual harassment by former employees of the restaurant trade association he headed during the 1990s , consuming mr cain s campaign with questions about his judgment and management style prosperity usa was founded last year by mark block , a conservative activist and political consultant who is now mr cain s chief of staff mr block formerly ran the wisconsin chapter of americans for prosperity , the group cofounded by the billionaire koch brothers speaking at a panel discussion on tuesday in washington , mr block repeatedly declined to answer questions about the irregularities , saying only that the accusations would be reviewed the internal documents from prosperity usa suggest that the group , a nonprofit organization , effectively subsidized some early costs of mr cain s presidential bid such expenditures would violate federal election and campaign laws , which prohibit taxexempt groups from engaging in any political activity or contributing to election campaigns the nonprofit s internal documents cite costs due from foh apparently short for friends of herman cain in late december 2010 and january 2011 those costs include thousands of dollars in travel expenses to iowa , louisiana , las vegas and houston for travel and meetings an additional 3 , 764 was owed for ipads if they are supporting his campaign , whether directly or indirectly , they are violating the law , said lawrence h norton , an election lawyer at womble carlyle and a former general counsel of the federal election commission a lawyer listed on prosperity usa s incorporation papers said he was no longer representing the group it is unclear whether prosperity usa still exists prosperity usa incorporated in april 2010 in wisconsin and has sought taxexempt status from the internal revenue service , according to documents filed with the state mr block was a tea party activist who formerly ran the wisconsin chapter of americans for prosperity , a nonprofit grassroots advocacy organization founded by the conservative koch brothers and others mr cain has for years spoken at events organized by americans for prosperity or tea party groups while mr cain did not formally enter the republican presidential campaign until may , he began accepting contributions in january and his campaign disclosed socalled testingthewater activities dating back to late december 2010 , according to his federal campaign filings none of the money spent by prosperity usa for mr cain appears to be accounted for in his presidential filings , whether as inkind contributions , services rendered or debts it is not clear whether mr cain or his campaign ever paid those bills or reimbursed prosperity usa if any of these expenses were paid by the nonprofit , it is possible that they thought they were paying for expenses entirely unrelated to testing the waters , ' said paul s ryan , associate legal counsel at the campaign legal center , a nonprofit watchdog group but the fact that this nonprofit is listing on its balance sheet money owed to them by a federal campaign committee is problematic prosperity usa appeared to be a shoestring operation for the first six months of 2010 , according to the documents , raising about 65 , 000 in grants and spending just 58 , 893 but sometime in the second half of the year , its spending roughly tripled , fueled by a 150 , 000 loan from an unidentified party the internal documents appear to show that prosperity usa received money from or was owed money by several conservative groups , including americans for prosperity chapters in florida and oklahoma one amount , 5 , 000 , includes the memo line herman cain attended at request of afp mr cain headlined an americans for prosperity oklahoma event in october 2010 the group also paid for mr block to fly to washington to meet with david koch and tim phillips , the president of americans for prosperity
washington late on a moonless night last march , a plane smuggling nearly half a ton of cocaine touched down at a remote airstrip in a heavily armed ground crew was waiting for it as were honduran security forces after a 20minute firefight , a honduran officer was wounded and two lay dead several news outlets the episode , mentioning that a honduran official said the united states had provided support but none of the reports included a striking detail that support consisted of an elite detachment of militarytrained dea special agents who joined in the shootout , according to a person familiar with the episode the dea now has five commandostyle squads it has been quietly deploying for the past several years to western hemisphere nations including , honduras , the dominican republic , and belize that are battling drug cartels , according to documents and interviews with law enforcement officials the program called fast , for foreigndeployed advisory support team was created during the to investigate linked drug traffickers in afghanistan beginning in 2008 and continuing under , it has expanded far beyond the war zone you have got to have special skills and equipment to be able to operate effectively and safely in environments like this , said michael a braun , a former head of operations for the drug agency who helped design the program the dea is working shouldertoshoulder in harm s way with hostnation counterparts the evolution of the program into a global enforcement arm reflects the united states' growing reach in combating drug cartels and how policy makers increasingly are blurring the line between law enforcement and military activities , fusing elements of the war on drugs with the war on terrorism bruce bagley , a university of miami professor who specializes in latin america and counternarcotics , said the commando program carries potential benefits the american teams could help arrest kingpins , seize stockpiles , disrupt smuggling routes and professionalize security forces in small countries through which traffickers pass drugs headed to the united states but there are also potential dangers it could lead to a nationalist backlash in the countries involved , he said if an american is killed , the administration and the dea could get mired in congressional oversight hearings taking out kingpins could fragment the organization and lead to more violence and it wo n't permanently stop trafficking unless a country also has capable institutions , which often do n't exist in central america because the presence of armed americans on their soil raises sensitivities about sovereignty , some countries that have sought the assistance of the united states will not acknowledge it , and the dea is reluctant to disclose the details of the commando teams' deployments others like mexico , which has accepted american help , including surveillance drones have not wanted the commando squads federal law prohibits the drug agency from directly carrying out arrests overseas , but agents are permitted to accompany their foreign counterparts on operations the americans work with specially vetted units of local security forces that they train and mentor in exigent circumstances , they may open fire to protect themselves or partners the firefight in honduras last march , described by officials of both countries , illustrates the flexibility of such rules the honduran minister of public security at the time , oscar lvarez , said that under the agreement with the dea , the americans normally did not go on missions but in that case , he said , a training exercise went live an american squad was working with a honduran police unit in la mosquitia when they received word that a suspicious plane from venezuela was being tracked to a clandestine landing strip nearby after the plane landed , the honduran police identified themselves and the traffickers opened fire , officials of both countries said after a 20minute gunfight , the hondurans and americans seized the cocaine and withdrew to evacuate the wounded officer i do n't want to say it was vietnamstyle , but it was typical of war action , said mr lvarez he declined to say whether the americans took part in the shooting , but another person familiar with the episode said they did the fast program is similar to a dea operation in the late 1980s and early 1990s in which drug enforcement agents received military training and entered into partnerships with local forces in places like peru and bolivia , targeting smuggling airstrips and jungle labs the reaganera initiative , though , drew criticism from agency supervisors who disliked the disruption of supplying agents for temporary rotations , and questioned whether its benefits outweighed the risks and cost the clinton administration was moving to shut down the operation when five agents died in a plane crash in peru in 1994 , sealing its fate in 2000 , when the united states expanded assistance to colombia in its battle against the narcoticsfinanced insurgent group called farc , the trainers were military , not dea but after the invasion of afghanistan , the bush administration assigned mr braun , a veteran of the earlier effort , to design a new program begun in 2005 , the program has five squads , each with 10 agents many are military veterans , and the section is overseen by a former member of the navy seals , richard dobrich the pentagon has provided most of their training and equipment , and they routinely fly on military aircraft the deployments to afghanistan have resulted in large seizures of drugs , and some tragedy two of the three dea agents who died in a were with fast last week , an agent was shot in the head when his squad came under fire while leaving a bazaar where they had just seized 3 , 000 kilograms , about 6 , 600 pounds , of poppy seeds and 50 kilograms , about 110 pounds , of opium airlifted to germany in critical condition , he is expected to survive , an official said the commandos have also been deployed at least 15 times to latin america the dea said some of those missions involved only training , but officials declined to provide details still , glimpses of the program emerged in interviews with current and former american and foreign officials , , and several state department cables released by wikileaks for example , an american team assisted guatemalan forces in the march 2011 arrest of juan alberto ortizl pez , whom the dea considered a top cocaine smuggler for the sinaloa cartel , an official said of the show masked men in black tactical garb it is unclear if any are americans a describes another mission in guatemala on july 21 , 2009 , seven american military helicopters carrying dea and guatemalan security forces flew to the compound of a wealthy family , the lorenzanas four of whom were wanted in the united states on drug trafficking charges after a small firefight in which a bullet grazed a lorenzana family member , agents found large numbers of weapons and amounts of cash but not the targets , who may have been tipped off , according to the cable the guatemalan news media documented the failure , portraying the joint operation as a dea raid a former head of guatemala s national security council , francisco jim nez , said in an interview that american participation in such operations was an open secret but rarely acknowledged in october 2009 , another official said , the agency deployed a squad aboard a navy amphibious assault ship , the wasp , off the coast of haiti and the dominican republic , where it focused on planes used for smuggling cables also show the agency has twice to deploying one of its units to the dari n region of panama , where farc incursions have established cocaine smuggling routes but both missions were aborted , for fears that it was or that their involvement  fast has repeatedly deployed squads to haiti , helping to arrest three fugitives this year and train 100 haitian counternarcotics officers this fall mario andresol , the haitian police chief , says he needs such help we know the smuggling routes , he said , but the problem is we do n't have enough people to go after them
washington the first six months of 2011 are bringing america a good many different productions of the old romantic classic giselle in january there were live simulcasts from the royal ballet in london and the bolshoi in moscow by the end of this month , the alabama ballet , richmond ballet and san francisco ballet will all have staged revivals and coming up we can expect american ballet theater s version and a new production by pacific northwest ballet in seattle that will try to restore many details lost since the 19th century amid all this , it s good to revisit the production by the mariinsky ballet being presented at the here no company has a giselle track record to match this one s since the 1840s , the holy ballet \( as the ballerina tamara karsavina called it \) has never been long out of repertory there true , the st petersburg version was extensively revised by marius petipa in the 1880s and overhauled by various directors later a program credit suggests that the present production was shaped in 1978 in act i the dichotomy between dancing , joyous peasants and pedestrian aristocrats looks actually even more soviet than i remembered the nobles are chilly , inhibited and formal , whereas the peasants are expansive , nuanced and remarkably refined another style arises in act ii with the corps de ballet of supernatural and deathdealing wilis , who dance with a weighted , monumental but poignantly beautiful grandeur unlike anything in act i it is still a thrill to watch them form one gorgeously sculptural diagonal across the stage , like the most beautiful of barriers then a dominolike ripple passes down the line , as each one turns and directs the hapless hans \( as the mariinsky calls giselle s unsuccessful suitor , hilarion , a loser in both acts \) to his doom seconds later , after the wilis' queen , myrtha , has led them off in posses to hunt the next male victim , they reassemble in that original sensuous but unyielding diagonal , ready to commence the same fatal ritual with albrecht , giselle s lover and their new prey next , however , a different ripple passes down their line , from the opposite corner toward myrtha , as they react to giselle , who comes running to interrupt the proceedings no other company presents these lines and waves with such spectacular elegance but there are many kinds of style when the bolshoi ballet brought giselle to the west in the 1950s , the stanislavskian realism of the acting made a tremendous impression today it tends to be western productions that demonstrate , at least to some degree , that aspect of acting style \( as the royal ballet simulcast showed handsomely \) , not the bolshoi or mariinsky companies with the mariinsky , for example , hans a rich acting role in the right hands is now merely a melodramatic stick figure the metronomic way he enters in act ii , pausing pointlessly on every chime of midnight , is ludicrous this is now the third mariinsky staging i have seen in which a hunt scene includes a stuffed version of a dead animal \( a deer in this case \) so unconvincing that it elicits laughter from the audience giselle s rival , bathilde , who arrives with the hunt , is stuffy , bossy and charmless originally , the ballet ended with bathilde tenderly reclaiming her fianc , albrecht you would n't wish such a fate on the poor guy at the mariinsky then there is the conundrum of how mariinsky dancers are trained to hear but ignore the music generally they lag behind the beat \( sometimes subtly and sometimes drearily \) , but most of them know how to anticipate it when it comes to striking a final pose and there are stranger sequences when they 're evidently making a rhythmic point that seems to disregard the music tuesday s performance , led by the illustrious diana vishneva \( who will also dance giselle this spring with american ballet theater \) , was oddly flat she kept turning her pictureperfect face to the audience , as if to say , this is one of my best bits , as she souped it up the big moments were all technically admirable , but this was a giselle who was living up to her own press notices rather than to the role s drama her albrecht was andrian fadeyev pallidly amiable , a moth to ms vishneva s selfconscious flame even the marvelous ekaterina kondaurova , as myrtha the company s most elegantly statuesque dancer seemed to be letting us know how often she had danced this role wednesday s giselle was fresher alina somova , who was often irksomely overacrobatic when the mariinsky danced at city center in 2008 , was vividly engaged in relating the story to the audience though she s not a remarkably subtle actress , her sheer energy and involvement injected some muchneeded life into the action her dancing still has passages of leggy excess both in jumps and lifts , her line can be uncoordinated but there were moments when the brightness and fullness of her execution caught the breath her partner , evgeny ivanchenko , has much of her welcome assertiveness of manner without showing particular dance individuality alexandra iosifidi was another statuesque myrtha but entirely compelling the multifaceted nature of her dances enigmatic , poignant , devout , intense , heroic was unusually absorbing no company takes greater pride in its traditions than the mariinsky , and yet no company shows more evidence of systematic reconsideration of basic tenets of style and text wrists , posture , knees over the years i 've been alternately impressed and dismayed by how the company has reaccentuated these and other aspects of its heritage it s good to see almost no signs of the chinup manner that disfigured so much of the company s dancing a few years ago , and absolutely none of the swayback posture that became widespread 20 years ago over the decades , this production has had quite a number of revisions the most obvious have been for the act i ensemble of male peasants thirty years ago , they were impeccable classicists who did unison double air turns arriving in fifth position , but they 'd been rechoreographed as folk dancers by the late 1980s their current incarnation is a tepid compromise indeed , despite its best moments , the whole staging has grown tepid in the 1980s the mariinsky presented some of the most revelatory performances of giselle of my experience some new ignition is needed
baltimore of all the goals of the education reform movement , none is more elusive than developing an objective method to assess teachers studies show that over time , test scores do not provide a consistent means of separating good from bad instructors test scores are an inadequate proxy for quality because too many factors outside of the teachers' control can influence student performance from year to year or even from classroom to classroom during the same year often , more than half of those teachers identified as the poorest performers one year will be judged average or above average the next , and the results are almost as bad for teachers with multiple classes during the same year fortunately , there s a far more direct approach measuring the amount of time a teacher spends delivering relevant instruction in other words , how much teaching a teacher actually gets done in a school day this is hardly a new insight thirty years ago two studies measured the amount of time teachers spent presenting instruction that matched the prescribed curriculum , at a level students could understand based on previous instruction the studies found that some teachers were able to deliver as much as 14 more weeks a year of relevant instruction than their less efficient peers there was no secret to their success the efficient teachers hewed closely to the curriculum , maintained strict discipline and minimized noninstructional activities , like conducting unessential classroom business when they should have been focused on the curriculum and both studies found that the teachers who taught more were also the teachers who produced students who performed well on standardized tests such insight is relevant to almost all the difficulties facing reformers trying to translate test results into useful policies for example , it means that administrators do n't have to wait until test scores are evaluated , usually at the end of the year , by which time students have already fallen further behind they could simply videotape a few minutes of instruction a day , then evaluate the results to see how much time teachers spent on their assigned material and the extent to which they were able to engage students indeed , the very process of recording classroom instruction would probably push some underperforming teachers to become more efficient a focus on relevant instructional time also implies several further reforms lengthening the school day , week and year adopting a nearzerotolerance policy for disruptive behavior , which classroom cameras would help police increasing efforts to reduce tardiness and absenteeism and providing as much supplementary and remedial tutoring \( the most effective instructional model known \) as possible nor are these particularly difficult policies to put in place many schools around the country , particularly charters , already use some or all of them but focusing on the amount of instruction , and its efficiency , also points toward more ambitious steps decades of research have shown that student achievement does n't derive solely from the classroom one famous study , by the psychologists todd risley and betty hart , found that children of professional families from ages 1 to 3 than children from poorer families to make up for that difference , schools could make online tutoring programs covering the entire elementary school curriculum available , both in school and at home this approach could mimic the characteristics that make human tutoring so effective , including the ability to immediately ascertain what a student needs to learn , to tailor instruction to those needs , and to provide immediate feedback regarding student progress we may never find better teachers by looking only at standardized test results instead , we need to make sure that students receive as much instruction as possible from those teachers they do have

any visual artist fated to be a onehit wonder would be beyond lucky if that hit were as marvelous as the fulbright triptych , simon dinnerstein s overlooked masterpiece of 1970s realism this crackling , obsessive showboat of a painting , dreamed up during a decade when the medium supposedly teetered on the brink of death , is a threepanel autobiographical allegory of life , love and art that measures 14 feet across it currently reigns over an otherwise desultory survey of mr dinnerstein s art at the german consulate general near the united nations the show is a reconstituted version of one seen this spring at the tenri cultural institute in greenwich village if you missed it there , as i almost did , do n't miss it again the fulbright triptych is an amazing artwork with a fascinating back story , primarily of obscurity mr dinnerstein , who was born in brooklyn in 1943 , earned a history degree from city college and studied drawing and painting for three years in the '60s at the brooklyn museum art school , began the work in 1971 at the time he and his wife , ren e , were in germany , where he was studying printmaking and the prints of , courtesy of a fulbright fellowship \( hence the work s title and its current appearance at the german consulate \) he completed it in 1974 in a brooklyn studio and presented it to the world in his solo debut the next year , at the staempfli gallery on the upper east side the fulbright triptych was the first painting mr dinnerstein had attempted since art school and unlike anything he has made since mixing realist styles from hyper to folk , the work depicts an elaborately detailed interior that seems to encompass much of what he cared about most in art , nature , politics and includes on its flanking panels fulllength , nearly lifesize portraits of himself , his wife and their infant daughter , , who was born , postfulbright , back in brooklyn mr dinnerstein , who is now 68 , seems well aware of the work s specialness in an interview in the idiosyncratic book the suspension of time reflections on simon dinnerstein and the fulbright triptych , ' he describes it as the best possible me , times a hundred the work has the majestic symmetry and stillness of a religious altarpiece , and the intimate allure of a wellkept artist s studio the object of worship is primarily art old and new , high and low , in various mediums and styles art is signified by the postcards of historic paintings and sculptures dotting walls that ambiguously evoke wood paneling , wallpaper and pegboard it is conjured by the printmaking tools neatly arrayed on the implacably sturdy worktable that is in many ways the painting s main character , and also by the two large , squarish windows above the table where views of a postwar german suburb and the countryside beyond function as paintings within the painting and it is all but anthropomorphized by the engraved copper printmaking plate supposedly the focus of mr dinnerstein s visit to germany that sits on a pillow at the center of the table , a little like the christ child , available for perusal and adoration intricately profuse with depictions of trees , the plate also alludes to nature as the source of all art calling mr dinnerstein a onehit wonder may not be quite accurate because it implies that his painting brought him some renown actually , fame has assiduously eluded the triptych , despite a favorable review of its staempfli gallery debut in the new york times and something of an underground reputation , especially in conservative realist circles in 1982 george staempfli , owner of the gallery and also of the triptych \( by virtue of having paid a monthly stipend that enabled mr dinnerstein to complete it \) , sold it to the palmer museum of art at pennsylvania state university would that william s lieberman , then chairman of the department of 20thcentury art at the metropolitan museum of art , had acquired the fulbright triptych like all department heads at the met , he had a discretionary acquisition fund that he could tap without board approval he also had an eclectic and ecumenical eye it is not hard to imagine a painting as innately appealing as mr dinnerstein s becoming one of the met s most popular works of late20thcentury art the spell cast by the triptych reflects its nature as an elaborate rebus of subjects , images , occasional texts \( wittgenstein and melville \) , paint textures and representational styles the windowsills are spotted with blooms of color that suggest a wellused easel the depictions of macadam streets and stuccoed houses outside are often so roughly textured as to be almost the real thing the art reproductions are loosely painted , with a smooth , creamy thickness the portraits of the dinnersteins are relatively dry and thin of surface \( they might almost be painted cutouts \) there are also passages of exquisite trompe l'oeil , like the pocked and chipped floorboards of the studio , in dark reds and browns , which are based on those in the brooklyn room where the triptych was completed for all this exuberant diversity , the work is not without hierarchies the walls above the table and around the windows , for example , are reserved primarily for images of high art postcards of masterpieces by van eyck , vermeer , holbein , degas , seurat and donatello but in the flanking panels , where the artist and his family reside , artworks battle it out with more prosaic visual material wonderful children s drawings , news clippings , snapshots and photobooth images of the dinnersteins , both before and after the birth of their child over mr dinnerstein s left shoulder is an exit visa for semyon rafielovich pichkhadze , identified in the book as probably a georgian jew , that will expire on july 6 , 1971 it reminds us that mr dinnerstein and his family are jewish , and that they are depicted in germany , which a little over a quartercentury earlier had initiated a system of extermination from which millions of jews were unable to escape it is worth noting that along the back edge of the studio table , a row of tiny worndown nubs of pencil and pastel evoke the small rocks and pebbles that visitors traditionally set on gravestones in jewish cemeteries it is disconcerting to move from the fulbright triptych , which seems so rich with possibility , to the rather bloodless academic art , often featuring weirdly salacious yet idealized female nudes , that mr dinnerstein has made since occasionally you can see him return to the idea of contrasting different kinds of rendering and texture , as in works like solaris \( 2003 \) , with its encrusted color swirling around a small photographlike selfportrait , but the results are heavyhanded it undoubtedly did not help the prominence of the fulbright triptych that mr dinnerstein failed to make good on its promise , but this should not be held against it one hit is a lot better than none at all , and this one could definitely have a place in the history of its time it has qualities in common with sylvia sleigh s tightly wound realism , with the encyclopedic scope of jennifer bartlett s process art painting of 197576 and also with the artfilled trompe l'oeil paintings that  the people at the german consulate believe so fiercely in the fulbright triptych that , after the dinnerstein exhibition closes on sept 15 , the painting will remain in place , in the consulate s rather inhospitable lobby , until march 15 the met should try to carve out a slot in its exhibition schedule during this period and persuade all concerned to let it give the triptych a small , properly professional show , possibly with some of the large charcoal portrait drawings that mr dinnerstein made during the same period the four examples reproduced in the book about the triptych look fabulous because ultimately the single most startling fact about mr dinnerstein s fulbright triptych is that it has never had the honor which it richly deserves of being exhibited in a major museum , in new york or anywhere else if it were , anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights would be beyond lucky
rogers communications and bell canada , two giant communications firms , said friday that they would pay more than 13 billion canadian , or about 12 billion american , for a controlling stake in , canada s largest sports conglomerate the assets of the conglomerate include the toronto maple leafs of the nhl , the raptors of the nba and the air canada centre maple leaf sports and entertainment , which is owned by the ontario teachers' pension plan , is one of the largest sports businesses in the world , rivaling msg in new york and aeg in los angeles forbes recently , easily the most valuable team in the nhl the deal is one of the largest sportsrelated acquisitions in north american history rogers and bell canada , bitter rivals in the telecommunications and media industries , will each own 375 percent of mlse larry tanenbaum , the mlse chairman , will raise his stake to 25 percent from 20 percent mlse will remain an independent company , and rogers and bell canada will be able to provide broadcasts of maple leafs games and other games to their phone , television and internet subscribers i think our investment in the maple leafs is a perfect marriage of content and technology , said nadir mohamed , chief executive of rogers , which also owns the toronto blue jays this is icing on the cake this is access to iconic content mohamed said the blue jays would not be merged into mlse george cope , the chief executive of bell canada , said his company would continue to maintain its minority stake in the montreal canadiens the deal comes about two weeks after ontario teachers said it had ended an eightmonth auction and was no longer seeking buyers several newspapers reported at the time that the deal had fallen apart partly because rogers and bell canada could not agree on how to divide mlse , particularly its valuable television rights other reports noted that ontario teachers , which held an auction for mlse after it received several unsolicited bids , was willing to sell only if its target price was met when rogers and bell canada agreed to value mlse at 21 billion canadian , or about 17 billion american for an 80 percent stake , ontario teachers agreed to sell while the companies hope to complete the sale by next summer , the agreement is not a sure thing reports of a sale have surfaced at least twice , and there are regulatory hurdles to clear and league approvals to seek after years of approving many large mergers , canadian regulators are more aggressively scrutinizing proposed deals bell canada and rogers are canada s equivalent of att and verizon they own the two biggest wireless carriers and the two largest internet service providers rogers dominates the cable television business in ontario , while bell has a satellite television service and has recently been selling television service over a fiber optic network bell is canada s largest private broadcaster both companies own sports channels rogers s ownership of the blue jays and their stadium could cause concern with regulators fearful of the company s control of too many teams and arenas \( mlse also owns toronto fc of major league soccer and its stadium \) if regulators ask rogers to sell the blue jays and their stadium , it could significantly slow the completion of the deal for mlse the federal competition bureau in ottawa said friday that it would review the proposed acquisition the chief executives of the companies said they were confident regulators would approve the deal because it ensures that they would continue to compete they noted the companies worked together during the winter olympics in vancouver , an economics professor at queen s university in kingston , ontario , who specializes in competition issues , said the competition bureau was likely to look at the impact of the transaction on the livesportsevent market in toronto if the deal is approved , rogers will own or control almost every major professional sports team based in the city but ware said the two companies could try to convince regulators that live sports are not a distinct market , because they compete against other forms of entertainment mlse is a sprawling sports group , but the crown jewel is the maple leafs the team had revenue of 193 million last year and operating income of 818 million , according to forbes the maple leafs have won 11 stanley cups , but none since 1967 , the longest current drought in the nhl they have missed the playoffs the last six seasons still , because they play in a hockeymad area that is also the fifthlargest market in north america , they play to capacity crowds and have a long waiting list for season tickets this season the club is second in the northeast division , having won 15 of 28 games mlse s other sports properties also have spotty records the raptors are less profitable than the leafs and have made the playoffs only five times since their founding in 1995 toronto fc has played to capacity crowds at bmo field since joining mls in 2006 , but has yet to make the league s playoffs the leafs' minor league affiliate , the toronto marlies of the american hockey league , are also part of the deal they have played to small crowds at ricoh coliseum since they were founded in 2005 rogers owns the rogers centre , formerly called the skydome , where the blue jays and the argonauts of the canadian football league play rogers has owned the blue jays since 2000 the team has not made the playoffs since winning the world series in 1992 and 1993 rogers is also in the fourth year of a fiveyear deal to have the buffalo bills play a total of eight preseason and regularseason nfl games at the rogers centre
a month ago most americans could not have picked hosni mubarak out of a police lineup american foreign policy , even in afghanistan , was all but invisible throughout the 2010 election season foreign aid is the only federal budget line that and so now as the world s most unstable neighborhood explodes before our eyes does anyone seriously believe that most americans are up to speed \? our government may be scrambling , but that s nothing compared to its constituents after a neardecade of fighting wars in the arab world , we can still barely distinguish sunni from shia the live feed from egypt is riveting we ca n't get enough of revolution video even if , some nights , middle west blizzards take precedence over middle east battles on the networks' evening news but more often than not we have little or no context for what we 're watching that s the legacy of years of selfcensored , superficial , provincial and at times islamophobic coverage of the arab world in a large swath of american news media even now we 're more likely to hear speculation about how many cents per gallon the day s events might cost at the pump than to get an intimate look at the demonstrators' lives perhaps the most revealing window into america s mediafed isolation from this crisis small an example as it may seem is the default assumption that the egyptian uprising , like every other paroxysm in the region since the green revolution in iran 18 months ago , must be powered by the twin americanborn phenomena of twitter and facebook television news at once threatened by the power of the internet and fearful of appearing unhip ca n't get enough of this clich three days after riot police first used tear gas and water hoses to chase away crowds in tahrir square , cnn s new primetime headliner , piers morgan , that the use of social media was the most fascinating aspect of this whole revolution on msnbc that same night , lawrence o 'donnell a teacher who had spent a year at the american school in cairo they are all on facebook , she said of her former fifthgrade students the fact that a sampling of fifth graders in the american school might be unrepresentative of , and wholly irrelevant to , the events unfolding in the streets of cairo never entered the equation the social networking hype eventually had to subside for a simple reason the egyptian government on its four main internet providers and yet the revolution only got stronger let s get a reality check here , said jim clancy , a cnn international anchor , who by noting that the biggest demonstrations to date occurred on a day when the internet was down there was n't any twitter there was n't any facebook , he said no less exasperated was another knowledgeable onthescene journalist , richard engel , who in a satellite hookup with rachel maddow this did n't have anything to do with twitter and facebook , he said this had to do with people s dignity , people s pride people are not able to feed their families no one would deny that social media do play a role in organizing , publicizing and empowering participants in political movements in the middle east and elsewhere but as malcolm gladwell last week , surely the least interesting fact about the egyptian protesters is that some of them may \( or may not \) have at one point or another employed some of the tools of the new media to communicate with one another what s important is why they were driven to do it in the first place starting with the issues of human dignity and crushing poverty that engel was trying to shove back to center stage among cyberintellectuals in america , a fascinating debate has broken out about whether social media can do as much harm as good in totalitarian states like egypt in his fiercely argued new book , the net delusion , evgeny morozov , a young scholar who was born in belarus , challenges the conventional wisdom of what he calls cyberutopianism among other mischievous facts , he reports that there were only 19 , 235 registered twitter accounts in iran \( 0027 percent of the population \) on the eve of what many american pundits rebranded its twitter revolution more damning , morozov also demonstrates how the digital tools so useful to citizens in a free society can be coopted by techsavvy dictators , police states and gardenvariety autocrats to spread propaganda and to track \( and arrest \) conveniently networked dissidents , from iran to venezuela hugo ch vez first as a conspiracy , but imbibing his selfsanctifying tweets this provocative debate is n't even being acknowledged in most american coverage of the internet s role in the current uprisings the talkinghead invocations of twitter and facebook instead take the form of implicit , simplistic western chauvinism how fabulous that two great american digital innovations can rescue the downtrodden , unwashed masses that is indeed impressive if no one points out that , even in the case of the young and relatively wired populace of egypt , only of those masses have internet access that we often do n't know as much about the people in these countries as we do about their tweets is a testament to the cutbacks in foreign coverage at many news organizations and perhaps also to our own desire to escape a war zone that has for so long sapped american energy , resources and patience we see the middle east on television only when it flares up and then generally in medium or long shot but there actually is an englishlanguage cable channel al jazeera english that blankets the region with bureaus and that could have been illuminating arab life and politics for american audiences since 2006 , when it was established as an editorially separate sister channel to its qatarbased namesake al jazeera english , run by a 35year veteran of the canadian broadcasting company , is it provided coverage of the 2009 gaza war and this year s tunisian revolt when no other television networks would or could yet in america , in washington , dc , and on small cable systems in ohio and vermont none of the biggest american cable and satellite companies comcast , directv and time warner offer it the noxious domestic political atmosphere fostering this nearblackout is obvious to all it was made vivid last week when bill o 'reilly of fox news about how al jazeera english is antiamerican this is the same we report , you decide fox news that last week just as the confrontations turned violent so that viewers could watch rupert murdoch promote his new tablet news product at a publicity event at the guggenheim museum in new york unable to watch al jazeera english , and ravenous for comprehensive and sophisticated 24 7 television coverage of the middle east otherwise unavailable on television , millions of americans last week tracked down the network s internet stream on their computers such was the workaround required by the censorship practiced by america s corporate gatekeepers you 'd almost think these newsstarved americans were iron curtain citizens clandestinely trying to pull in the jammed voice of america signal in the 1950s or egyptians desperately seeking al jazeera after last week the consequence of a decade s worth of indiscriminate demonization of arabs in america and of the low quotient of comprehensive adult news coverage that might have helped counter it is the steady rise in islamophobia the ground zero mosque melee has given way to battles over mosques as far removed from lower manhattan as california soon to come is a national witch hunt into the given the disconnect between america and the arab world , it s no wonder that americans are invested in the fights for freedom in egypt and its neighboring dictatorships only up to a point we 've been inculcated to assume that comes out on top is ipso facto a jihadist this week brings the eighth anniversary of the invasion of iraq is to follow as we took in last week s fiery video from cairo mesmerizing and yet populated by mostly anonymous extras we do n't understand and do n't know it was hard not to flash back to those glory days of shock and awe those bombardments too were spectacular to watch from a

learn the hard way that in truth we really had no idea what was going on
des moines enters the final four weeks of campaigning before the iowa caucuses with republican voters in the state viewing him as more prepared to be president than , more attuned to their concerns and just as capable of defeating , according to the latest new york times cbs news poll is rated more favorably than any of the other six remaining candidates in the race among voters who say they are likely to attend the republican caucuses in iowa he would be supported enthusiastically as his party s presidential nominee by more voters than any of his rivals , the poll found , and is leading in the headtohead competition as the campaign here builds but twothirds of likely voters remain open to changing their minds , the poll found , with even more saying they are willing to embrace a candidate who is less conservative than they are in order to win the white house and a large majority of voters say economic concerns are more important than social issues or , suggesting that mr romney has ample opportunity to make his case to voters a presidential race that has seen candidates abruptly rise and sharply fall is still remarkably unsettled here in iowa , where the republican nominating contest opens on jan 3 the outcome of the caucuses is likely to trim the field of candidates and help shape the contours of the primary race as it moves to new hampshire , south carolina and beyond as the campaign intensifies through television advertising and getoutthevote efforts , the contest is hardly a gingrichromney duel representative of texas is essentially tied with mr romney for second place , creating a combustible atmosphere as he and other rivals urgently work to slow the rapid ascent of mr gingrich the voters who will render the first judgment on the republican field have been carefully following the race 7 in 10 say they have watched recent televised debates and appear unified around the pursuit of beating mr obama of the nearly 4 in 10 likely caucusgoers who say they get most of their information from fox news , mr gingrich is the overwhelming choice mr gingrich , who is scrambling to build a campaign structure that can capitalize on his surging popularity , holds considerable advantages over his rivals the poll found that he is winning support from 31 percent of likely caucusgoers , who rate him as the most empathetic , the strongest commander in chief and best prepared for the job by a 2to1 ratio mr romney had the support of 17 percent and mr paul 16 percent the poll found that mr gingrich is drawing more than twice as much support as mr romney among men and those who identify themselves as conservative he receives three times more support than mr romney from evangelical christians mr romney receives more support from voters who call themselves moderate yet only 30 percent of likely caucusgoers say that they had been contacted by the gingrich campaign , raising questions about his ability to identify his supporters and lure them to more than 1 , 600 precinct caucus locations on a winter night by comparison , 60 percent say that they have been contacted by the paul campaign and 47 percent by the romney campaign , underscoring a stealth operation that has been under way for months he s always been at the back of my mind , said dennis halsne , 65 , a retired salesman from the central iowa town of woodward , speaking of mr gingrich in a followup interview he added is he a perfect candidate \? absolutely not none of them are but right now , he is the one who i would back the rise of mr gingrich comes after a year in which a forceful antiwashington sentiment has driven the agenda of the a leading attribute cited in interviews with voters here is his deep experience in washington he does better among those who say candidates should only be judged based on their political record he is supported by 39 percent of those voters but among those who say candidates should also judged on their personal life , he gets 27 percent support for now , mr gingrich s three marriages and some of the moderate positions he has taken do not appear to be dragging down his candidacy but a variety of polls released here this week solidifies his role as the frontrunner , and it remains an open question how prepared his campaign is to defend him as scrutiny increases over all aspects of his long public record he s kind of mellowed with age , said carolyn hein , 58 , a retired clerical worker from humboldt i'm on the fence a little about it , but he s still the most intelligent candidate out there the survey provides a snapshot of the unsettled republican nominating contest during a period when herman cain was weighing whether to continue his candidacy and ultimately decided to drop out on saturday the poll , which was conducted last wednesday through monday , included one question with mr cain and another without his standing was at 7 percent the rest of the republican lineup found that gov rick perry of texas has 11 percent , representative michele bachmann of minnesota is at 9 percent and rick santorum , a former senator from pennsylvania , has 4 percent former gov jon m huntsman jr of utah , who is not actively campaigning in iowa , received 1 percent the telephone poll was conducted in iowa among 642 registered republican and independent voters who said they were likely to take part in the republican caucuses on jan 3 the poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points about 3 in 10 of mr gingrich s supporters said mr romney was their second choice , while just over a quarter of mr romney s supporters said mr gingrich was their second choice the republicans are nearly equally divided over whether to select a nominee whom they agree with on issues or who stands the best chance of defeating mr obama mr romney is viewed favorably by 43 percent of republicans , compared with 57 percent in a times cbs news poll that was taken two months before the 2008 caucuses yet this time , voters say the economy is the overriding issue of the campaign and they are more interested in a candidate with business experience nearly twothirds of voters say that it was not disqualifying to change positions on issues , as mr romney has done why should we expect the politician to pick a viewpoint back in 2001 , and now in 2011 he should have the same viewpoint \? said karen anderson , 56 , a college administrator from west des moines maybe the facts have changed i think changing your mind is a strength
remember \? ten years ago that the attacks of sept 11 would change the way we think and act , moment to moment , week to week , for unknown weeks and months to come , and steely years the historian taylor branch spoke of a possible turning point against a generation of cynicism for all of us , and roger rosenblatt argued in time magazine that one good thing could come from this horror it could spell the end of the age of irony they were wrong , of course we know now that the new normal was very much like the old normal , at least in terms of the country s arts and entertainment blockbuster video stores \( yes , that s how many of us watched movies back then \) placed warnings on some films in light of the events of sept 11 , please note that this product contains scenes that may be disturbing to some viewers but violent pictures continued to top mostrented lists despite rumors of their demise , black humor and satire , too , remained alive and well on and the onion , which ran headlines like rest of country temporarily feels deep affection for new york ten years later , it is even clearer that 9 11 has not provoked a seismic change in the arts while there were shifts in the broader culture like an increasingly toxic polarization in our politics , and an alarming impulse to privilege belief over facts such developments have had less to do with 9 11 than with the ballooning of partisanship during the bush and obama administrations , and with unrelated forces like technology , which gave us the social media revolution of facebook , twitter and youtube , and which magnified the forces of democratization , relativism and subjectivity economic worries sparked by 9 11 and amplified by the 2008 wall street meltdown accelerated trends already in place , including the internet s undermining of old business models in music and publishing warier than ever of taking risks , hollywood looked even harder for specialeffects extravaganzas that could readily find a global audience , and broadway doubled down on shows starring bigname celebrities that could guarantee advance box office in response to 9 11 , the artistic community quickly mobilized jane rosenthal , craig hatkoff and robert de niro put together the \( which had its 10th anniversary this spring \) to help revitalize a ravaged lower manhattan and musicians including paul mccartney , keith richards , mick jagger , david bowie , the who and jayz did a benefit concert at madison square garden there was also an outpouring of art , like bruce springsteen s the rising , neil young s let s roll and anne nelson s earnest play the guys such works served useful purposes cathartic commemoration , therapeutic expression , public rallying but in retrospect , many of them now feel sentimental or heavyhanded later on , anger over the war in iraq and worries about the erosion of civil liberties under the bush war on terror would produce a wave of politically engaged movies and plays including michael moore s fahrenheit 9 11 and david hare s stuff happens unfortunately , a lot of it turned out to be obvious or shrill terrorist plots popped up on tv shows like law order and csi ny , while new counterterrorismthemed shows like the unit , sleeper cell and the forthcoming homeland proliferated some eloquent or daring works of art about 9 11 and the wars in afghanistan and iraq eventually did emerge most notably , kathryn bigelow s harrowing film the hurt locker , about a bomb disposal squad in iraq gregory burke s haunting play black watch , based on interviews with soldiers who served in iraq with a scottish regiment amy waldman s novel the submission , which explored the fallout of 9 11 on american attitudes toward muslims donald margulies s play time stands still , about the iraq war s effects on two journalists and their relationship and eric fischl s tumbling woman , a bronze sculpture commemorating those who fell or jumped to their deaths from the twin towers \( it was removed from rockefeller center after complaints that it was too disturbing , too soon \) compelling as such works are , however , none were really gamechanging none possess the vaulting ambition of , say , francis ford coppola s vietnam epic apocalypse now , or the sweep of mr delillo s underworld , which captured the entire cold war era instead , these 9 11 works feel like blips on the cultural landscape they neither represent a new paradigm nor suggest that the attacks were a cultural watershed perhaps this is because 9 11 did not really change daily life for much of the country perhaps it s because our add nation after the assassinations of jfk , rfk and mlk in the '60s , and decades of violence on 24hour news has become increasingly inured to shock some critics have argued that not enough time has passed for artists to gain sufficient perspective on 9 11 tolstoy , after all , wrote about napoleon s invasion of russia more than 50 years later in this respect , it may be decades before larger narratives \( concerning american vulnerability and american decline \) surface as animating ideas in ambitious works of art then again , picasso created guernica in 1937 , only weeks after the savage bombing of that town during the spanish civil war in the meantime , a lot of post9 11 culture seems like a cutandpaste version of pre9 11 culture or a more extreme version of it indeed , pop culture has slid so far into the slough of celebrity worship and escapist fluff that the antics of the kardashian sisters now pass as entertainment sensationalism continues its march , and so does the blurring between news and gossip reality shows , which took off in 2000 with survivor , continued to snowball in popularity james patterson , michael crichton and john grisham continued to dominate bestseller lists even things thought , after 9 11 , to be verboten like blowing up new york for a bigscreen thrill soon made a comeback in cloverfield \( 2008 \) , the statue of liberty is decapitated as a monster trashes the city for that matter , the last decade often seemed to be all about recycling old television shows \( get smart , miami vice \) and comic books \( spiderman , xmen \) were recycled into films old movies \( arthur , the karate kid \) were remade jukebox musicals were assembled onstage from old pop songs \( jersey boys and rock of ages \) , and vintage soul and roots rock enjoyed a revival instead of being the threshold to the future , the critic simon reynolds writes in his astute new book , retromania , the 2000s were dominated by the ' prefix revivals , reissues , remakes , reenactments in fact , several prominent novels dealing with 9 11 drew heavily from earlier classics ian mcewan s saturday , which captures the precariousness of post9 11 daily life , reads like a contemporary variation on virginia woolf s mrs dalloway jonathan safran foer s extremely loud and incredibly close features a hero named oskar , who resembles the hero of the same name in gunter grass s the tin drum and mohsin hamid s chilling novel the reluctant fundamentalist which recounts the effect 9 11 has on a successful pakistani immigrant borrowed the structure and central themes of camus s novel the fall why this eagerness to pour new content into old vessels \? in retromania , mr reynolds suggests technology in the 2000s contributed to a fading of the artistic imperative to be original in the case of 9 11 novels , familiar forms may also provide narrative strategies for artists trying to subdue an event that seemed to defy representation one that reminds us of philip roth s 1961 observation that american reality stupefies and infuriates the writer because it is continually outdoing our talents no doubt this is why many powerful works to emerge about 9 11 and its aftermath have been documentary or factbased in the past , with traumatic subjects like vietnam and aids , this has been the trajectory over time news accounts and witness testimony give way to memoirs , which in turn give way to more metaphorical works of the imagination while writers struggled to find words to describe the unimaginable , photographers captured the devastation of 9 11 with visceral eloquence here is new york a democracy of photographs , a project that invited everyone from professional photographers to regular new yorkers to share their images , created a choral portrait of the city through personal acts of bearing witness in terms of narrative scope and harrowing drama , no novel has yet to match the looming tower , lawrence wright s nonfiction account of the events that led to 9 11 terry mcdermott s book perfect soldiers drew a portrait of the real 9 11 hijackers that was far more compelling than the crude jihadi stereotype in john updike s novel terrorist alex gibney s documentary taxi to the dark side similarly provided a more indelible portrait of the dark side of the war on terror than such fictional films as rendition and redacted the straightup documentary 9 11 \( using video shot that day by jules and gedeon naudet \) possesses a raw power totally lacking in oliver stone s world trade center , which imposed a conventional hollywood frame around the story of two survivors , trying to make a chaotic nightmare yield an inspirational story with the soothing illusion of closure in fact , 9 11 poses distinct challenges to the artist as with mr stone s movie , there is the danger of trying to domesticate an overwhelming tragedy there is also the question of presumption how does one convey the enormity of the event without trivializing it \? how does one bend art forms more often used for entertainment or artistic expression toward the capturing of history \? in on the transmigration of souls , the composer john adams used taped sounds of new york to create what he called a memory space in which the audience could mourn in his novel the zero , jess walter used a kafkaesque sense of the absurd to conjure the posttraumatic stress disorder the nation suffered and in their tv series rescue me , denis leary and peter tolan looked directly at the post9 11 lives of firefighters for whom normal is dead and buried underneath ground zero all too often , however , artworks keyed to 9 11 felt mercenary or narcissistic craig wright s play recent tragic events was a slick romantic comedy about a blind date that takes place the day after 9 11 , and neil labute s the mercy seat , also set on sept 12 , used the attacks as an excuse for another of his cynical treatises on the venality of man novelists were equally solipsistic , using 9 11 as a plot point , as a mirror of their characters' inner lives , or as a device to try to inject importance into otherwise slender stories in helen schulman s a day at the beach , 9 11 leads a hip downtown couple to reassess their marriage and in fr d ric beigbeder s windows on the world , a fictional storyline about a man and his sons caught in the world trade center on 9 11 is crassly intercut with the intellectual musings of a selfimportant narrator sept 11 and the emotions it generated fear , anger , a desire for revenge also fueled the success of several entertainment franchises the hit counterterrorism show 24 , its cocreator joel surnow told the new yorker reporter jane mayer , was ripped out of the zeitgeist of what people s fears are their paranoia that we 're going to be attacked the series frequently used torture as a way of gathering intelligence it depicted the fight against terrorism much as members of the bush administration did as a struggle for american survival that required all means necessary in the case of the syfy channel s remake of battlestar galactica which depicted some humans who survive an attack by enemy robots its executive producer ronald d moore noted that many plot elements were informed by the 9 11 experience and the war on terrorism fans of microsoft s hugely popular video game , in which humans face off against an alliance of alien species bent on holy war , have also pointed to parallels between the aliens and al qaeda for that matter , fantasy epics pitting good versus evil in stark manichaean terms dominated the box office in the last decade among the topgrossing films were avatar , two installments of the lord of the rings , three installments of and the dark knight superheroes like spiderman and iron man ruled , and so did vampires there was a lot of intellectualizing about all this arguments that the fantasy boom embodied americans' need for escapism after 9 11 that superhero sagas offered audiences a way to process the tragedy that vampires , like terrorists , pose a deadly threat but often hide in plain sight steven spielberg said his 2005 remake of war of the worlds reflected post9 11 anxiety time s richard corliss described the joker in the dark knight as the terrorist as improv artist and voldemort and his death eaters in harry potter to osama bin laden and al qaeda it s too easy , however , to see every recent pop culture phenomenon as a metaphor for combating terrorism voldemort sprang from j k rowling s imagination well before 9 11 the tolkien novels , like batman , spiderman and many of their superhero brethren , predate 9 11 by decades , as do the first star wars movies curiously , the bestknown terroristthemed movies remain ones made before 9 11 , including \( 1997 \) , true lies \( 1994 \) , patriot games \( 1992 \) and die hard \( 1988 \) some of the works of art that would prove the most resonant in the post9 11 world also turn out to have been written before the attacks tony kushner began work on his play homebody kabul , which unfolds into an examination of the west s relationship with afghanistan , back in 1997 and such early don delillo novels as mao ii \( 1991 \) did a more prescient job of conjuring the post9 11 era in which terrorists have changed the rules of what is thinkable than the flimsy novels he wrote after the attacks it is another measure of how resistant 9 11 remains to artistic treatment that several of the more memorable artworks that captured the city s sense of loss did so by indirection colum mccann s novel let the great world spin focuses on new york city in 1974 , when philippe petit walked between the twin towers on a tightrope and ric burns s documentary the center of the world and camilo jos vergara s photographs on exhibit at the museum of the city of new york make us reexperience the loss of the world trade center by recounting its history at the same time , other artistic creations unrelated to 9 11 took on new depth or new meanings christo and jeanneclaude s monumental project the gates , conceived in 1979 and only realized in 2005 with the support of mayor michael r bloomberg , threaded central park with 7 , 500 gates wrapped in saffron fabric , turning that great communal space into a work of art that was at once visionary and interactive , ephemeral and enduring the largest public art project in the city s history , it became , for many new yorkers , a symbol of hope , of transcendence , of healing after 9 11 it s not that everything is different after 9 11 it s more that we look at the same stuff through a different prism , says kate d levin , the city s cultural affairs commissioner in the case of the gates , she adds , something that had nothing to do with 9 11 , something that was completely about aesthetics became that much more profound

first the barber of seville , then the marriage of figaro then what \? whether we are speaking of the plays of pierreaugustin caron de beaumarchais or the operas they inspired , the figaro triptych many have dreamed of including beaumarchais himself remains an elusive goal on friday the revives an that just might serve as the missing third panel i due figaro \( the two figaros \) , by  the commander in chief of the project is , in his fifth and final year of a milestone survey of the neglected musical legacy of his native naples , an italian house , is in the process of publishing critical editions of the resurrected scores a quick recap may be in order the sparkling barber of seville , a comedy of the ancien r gime , introduces figaro as fixer and factotum to the dashing young count almaviva in his quest to snatch the orphaned heiress rosina from the clutches of the guardian who keeps her under lock and key \( rossini s triumphant version , the fifth of six , opened to catcalls in rome in 1816 \) heralding the french revolution , the incendiary marriage of figaro depicts figaro , now almaviva s valet , dancing as fast as he can to keep his bride susanna countess rosina s maid from the clutches of their master all the while , the pageboy cherubino keeps the household in a fever state , fluttering around every woman in sight \( mozart s celestial adaptation , rushed onto the vienna stage two years after the play opened in paris , evidently preempted potential rivals \) i due figaro a product of several years mercadante spent in the operatic backwaters spain and portugal , and untouched since its first run in madrid in 1835 picks up the almaviva family saga a generation later the count is arranging a marriage for his daughter , inez , who unbeknownst to him has fallen in love with cherubino , now a colonel in the spanish military in a brazen ploy to win her , cherubino presents himself to the count under the name figaro , in a costume copied from figaro s , supplanting figaro in the count s favor yes , this is the almaviva gang , all right , whipping up fresh chaos in vintage style the scenario derives from les deux figaro \( 1790 \) , an unauthorized sequel to the marriage of figaro by the actorplaywright honor antoine richaudmartelly , who had played almaviva , though not to beaumarchais s satisfaction the libretto , in elegant italian , is by felice romani , bellini s partner in la sonnambula and norma opportunities for eavesdropping and hiding places abound , including not one but two wardrobes reminiscences of le nozze di figaro , especially , pop up frequently , as when the countess muses on happier days or susanna wraps the count around her little finger most important , extended action sequences provide the canvas for the largescale , multisection ensembles that are the glory of mozart s collaborations with the librettist lorenzo da ponte , a feature they perfected off the bat in le nozze di figaro the world remembers beaumarchais as the heir of moli re , but he was also much more a clockmaker and inventor of genius \( his plots make the head spin \) , a feisty litigant , an arms trader , a music teacher to french princesses and a devoted ladies' man his eventful personal life even inspired a play by goethe \( clavigo \) , in which he appears under his own name but who needed goethe \? in the first two figaro plays beaumarchais painted no fewer than three selfportraits the nimblewitted figaro and the adolescent skirtchaser cherubino bear nicknames from beaumarchais s own boyhood figaro , his patronymic \( fils caron , after his father andr charles caron \) ch rubin , an allusion to his legendary erotic precocity the increasingly willful and isolated almaviva \( lively spirit \) reflects the social aspirations of a commoner who in his late 20s \( more than a decade before he wrote the plays \) bought his way into the ruling class to posterity beaumarchais s name is synonymous with appetite and zest for the kinks of the human comedy , but as postrevolutionary france lurched from disaster to disaster , his outlook darkened \( failing health and personal grievances did the same for moli re \) it was in this mood that beaumarchais cranked out his third figaro play , la m re coupable \( the guilty mother \) , which opened in 1792 , two years after les deux figaro , on the eve of the terror from a single night s liaison with cherubino 20 years before the curtain rises , the countess the culpable mother of the title has borne a son now the count is seeking proof for his longfestering suspicions a mirror of bonedeep disillusionment , the play moves from dyspeptic cynicism to desperate , bornagain euphoria that rings sentimental and totally false few but scholars and antiquarians have ever had much time for la m re coupable , but over the last half century at least four composers have tried their luck with it , most prominently john corigliano in the ghosts of versailles \( 1991 \) , which mashes up the play with the histories of beaumarchais , marie antoinette and much else besides in a monumental construction that does not ride on mozart s or rossini s coattails but must stand or fall on its own on a lighter note massenet s fragile , stardriven ch rubin \( 1905 \) likewise based on a play presents the expageboy on his 17th birthday juggling lady loves like a nascent don giovanni but none of beaumarchais s other characters show up , and as a sequel to mozart s and rossini s masterpieces , ch rubin scarcely exists \( despite the autobiographical connotations , beaumarchais insisted that cherubino be played by a young and very pretty woman mozart , mercadante , massenet and corigliano followed suit in a sense , cherubino never grows up \) figaro , susanna and the almavivas are all present in odon von horvath s brechtian comedy figaro gets a divorce \( 1937 \) the play attracted the stringent german modernist giselher klebe , whose operatic version appeared in 1963 but general audiences have never taken his idiom to heart today any halfway competent 19thcentury composer goes down easier and with i due figaro as with the barber of seville , there are competing settings to choose from the first , by michele carafa , a lifelong friend of rossini and an occasional contributor to his operas , seems to have excited no lasting interest at the secondtier festival in 2006 or on dvd grove music online cites two more , which show no sign of returning so the coast seems clear for this fourth setting by mercadante , who has been in mr muti s sights recently on grounds having nothing to do with beaumarchais or his disciples over the last four years at the whitsun festival in salzburg we pointed up the links between mozart and the neapolitan school , mr muti said recently in new york to close the series i wanted to showcase a musician of the neapolitan school who points decisively towards the world of the 19th century in its full flower of course i thought right away of mercadante my first thought was that we should do one of his tragedies , maybe il bravo , ' which made such an impression on the young verdi then musicologists in madrid sent mr muti the newly reconstituted score of i due figaro i knew mercadante only as a serious composer , a composer of great severity , he said i had no idea of his flair for comedy these pages came to me like a bolt from the blue mr muti spoke warmly too of the brilliant writing for orchestra and voices , promising volleys of ravishing virtuosity like rossini s almaviva \( but unlike mozart s \) mercadante s is a coloratura tenor whose fancywork presupposes the highwire artistry of a juan diego fl rez lacy embellishments on the longspun soprano lines for the countess recall the bellini phrases maria callas exulted in at the peak of her powers cherubino s mezzosoprano pyrotechnics might have been made to order for cecilia bartoli for this modernday premiere mr muti is working with youngsters the orchestra giovanile luigi cherubini in the pit and handpicked newcomers in the leading roles exercising his right of approval over all aspects of the production , he promises that the staging will be very beautiful , very respectful in addition the spanish director is aiming to give the show an authentically spanish flavor the characters are very spanish , as i can say , knowing very well the character of the people of my country , mr sagi said recently from ravenna , where the company was rehearsing they have so much life there are so many imbroglios but what surprises me most of all is the real spanish air and the spanish perfume mercadante brought into the score with the boleros and fandangos and tiranas and cachuchas he knew from living in spain dramatically mr sagi is intrigued by the supporting character of a playwright , plagio as in plagiarism \? who hangs around figaro in hopes of pointers for a comedy he is writing \( the opera s subtitle is il soggetto d'una commedia , or the subject for a comedy \) he s like someone in pirandello , mr sagi said figaro is trying to invent a plot for him , but figaro has no real imagination it s real life that has the poetry and the creativity to make a comedy it s life that is the real poet i due figaro ends in the spirit of the beaumarchais the world has long known and loved , on a note of allaround forgiveness however temporary for one mad day s follies and betrayals , whether real or imaginary from such a premise a composer of genius ought to be able to spin lasting magic was mercadante that composer \? if so , his time may be at hand
it is no secret that the relationship between and wall street has chilled a striking measure of that is the latest campaign finance reports has raised far more money than mr obama this year from the firms that have been among wall street s top sources of donations for the two candidates that gap underscores the growing alienation from mr obama among many rankandfile financial professionals and mr romney s aggressive and successful efforts to woo them the imbalance exists at large investment banks and hedge funds , firms and commercial banks , according to a new york times analysis of the firms that accounted for the most campaign contributions from the industry to mr romney and mr obama in 2008 , based on data from the federal election commission and the nonpartisan center for responsive politics it could widen as mr obama , seeking to harness anger over growing , escalates his criticism of the industry , after a year spent trying to smooth ties bruised by efforts to impose tougher regulations since this spring , mr romney has raised 15 million from employees of firms like morgan stanley highbridge capital management , a hedge fund and blackstone , a private equity firm mr obama has raised just over 270 , 000 from firms that were among his leading sources of campaign cash in 2008 employees of goldman sachs , who in the 2008 campaign gave mr obama over 1 million more than donors from any other private employer in the country have given him about 45 , 000 this year mr romney has raised about 350 , 000 from the firm s employees those figures do not account for all wall street giving , nor for the full force of each candidate s robust network of wall street bundlers , wealthy individuals who raise money from friends , family members and business associates and mr obama continues to dominate mr romney and the rest of the republican field in overall fundraising he has raised close to 100 million so far this year for his campaign , three times more than mr romney , as well as 65 million for the democratic national committee the gap in wall street giving to mr obama and mr romney underscores disenchantment with mr obama in the industry and the challenges both candidates will face in grappling with public anger about the financial world for much of the last year , aides to mr obama have sought to mollify wall street executives still bristling over the president s criticisms of their profits and bonuses , while defending the administration s program of tougher oversight and regulation as both necessary and beneficial to the industry in the long term but with mr romney , a former massachusetts governor who once ran the private equity firm bain capital , the candidate many in mr obama s camp believe is his most likely republican opponent next fall , mr obama s campaign appears to sense an opportunity to harness public resentment over an industry that has largely thrived while the rest of the economy has not there s no doubt that governor romney has raised money off of his belief that wall street should be allowed to write its own rules again by repealing wall street reform , said ben labolt , an obama campaign spokesman the president put in place protections to ensure that the financial crisis is not repeated and that unacceptable risks are n't taken with americans' life savings for his part , mr romney is now pitching himself as the turnaround expert for an ailing national economy he has personally wooed major wall street donors , successfully recruiting several senior financial executives poised to back gov chris christie of new jersey had he opted for a white house bid but anger at big banks manifested by the growing occupy wall street protests in new york city and elsewhere is palpable enough that mr romney must avoid being seen as a friend of an industry that many americans blame for onerous bank fees and underwater mortgages to the extent anyone is supporting mitt romney over president obama , said andrea saul , a romney spokeswoman , it is because of the state of the economy and the president s failures to create jobs on friday , mr obama also voluntarily released an updated list of his bundlers for the campaign a practice none of the republican candidates has adopted mr obama recruited about 100 bundlers during the three months ending sept 30 , according to an analysis by the times , some veterans of his 2008 effort , and some new to the ranks among the new recruits are harvey weinstein , the movie mogul , who has raised more than half a million dollars for mr obama roger c altman , a prominent investment banker who backed hillary rodham clinton in 2008 but has raised more than 200 , 000 for mr obama this year and john e frank , a microsoft executive , who has raised more than 500 , 000 for the president mr obama also recruited amy friedkin , a san francisco philanthropist of jewish causes and a former president of the american israel public affairs committee , who raised more than 200 , 000 for mr obama all the presidential candidates were required to disclose by midnight on saturday their fundraising and spending during the three months ending sept 30 those filings suggest that mr romney is facing a tough fundraising challenge from gov of texas mr perry raised 17 million during the quarter ending on sept 30 , roughly 60 percent from a loyal network of texas donors mr romney raised a little over 14 million , with the largest portion coming from california , where he raised 16 million , and new york , where he raised 15 million mr romney raised 637 , 000 in texas his fifthbiggest fundraising state and while both candidates enter the fall with about the same amount of cash on hand , mr romney s campaign more than doubled its rate of spending over the spring months , spending about 12 million during the quarter , including close to 600 , 000 in travel , 28 million on direct mail and 36 million on consultants , a figure that includes costs associated with campaign staff , technology vendors , and fundraising mr perry , who entered the race in midaugust , halfway through the quarter , has spent just 2 million that included about 460 , 000 on travel , 46 , 320 on direct mail and printing and 103 , 000 on consultants because he is a sitting governor , some costs , such as his security detail , are borne by taxpayers and the fiilings do not reflect salary for some of his top aides , david carney , and his communications director , ray sullivan a press officer for the campaign said the two aides were first paid in october representative , the texas republican whose libertarian views have won him a loyal grassroots following , showed 83 million in contributions , half in amounts of less than 200 each , the former pizza chain executive who has shot up in some recent polls , reported raising 28 million and having 13 million on hand , while representative michele bachmann of minnesota raised almost 4 million in the third quarter and spent nearly 6 million , ending with about 13 million in cash the other republican candidates appeared to be lagging far behind , the former pennsylvania senator , reported raising 704 , 000 during the three months ending sept 30 and had just 229 , 114 on hand , the former utah governor , has 327 , 000 left in his campaign account and more than twice that in debt , his campaign said on friday newt gingrich , the former house speaker , raised 808 , 000 during the quarter ending sept 30 with just 353 , 417 in cash on hand
you have to love the fact that when john yates on monday as the assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police in london a k a scotland yard he complained about the huge amount of inaccurate , illinformed and , on occasion , downright malicious gossip that had finally forced his hand my first thought was he did n't really say that , did he \? my second thought was can any human being truly be that unaware \? when the writers and editors of the late , unlamented news of the world were mr yates s police officers , what they wanted in return was gosh ! malicious gossip when they were hacking the phones of royal family members and murdered teenagers , they were seeking , you know , malicious gossip when the recently arrested rebekah brooks called gordon brown , the former prime minister , to tell him that rupert murdoch s sun , which she then edited , was about to reveal that his infant child had cystic fibrosis information that brown is convinced came from a hacked phone message she was telling him the paper was going to print a piece of gossip that a more humane institution would have let pass she might not have viewed this as malicious , but the brown family certainly did let s be honest here there is something undeniably rich about seeing the tables turned like this when i see photographs of brooks , or murdoch , or his son james \( who until a few weeks ago was his father s heir apparent at the news corporation \) , sitting in their cars , staring blankly ahead , i can just picture the paparazzi horde jostling to get a decent shot of its prey murdoch s papers have always feasted on scandals like this , picking the bones of their victims now murdoch s the one whose bones are being picked the schadenfreude is so thick you ca n't cut it with a chainsaw , wrote the wall street journal in an editorial on monday , defending rupert murdoch and the news corporation \( that s right after woefully undercovering the scandal in its news pages , the journal s editorial page is now leaping to the defense of its owner proving , yet again , that the journal knows where its bread is buttered \) well , yes , the schadenfreude is pretty darn thick who would deny it \? the whole thing reminds me a little of the ending of ian mcewan s solar , in which the many awful things the central character has done in his long life suddenly come together to bury him in an avalanche of comeuppance i'm ok with that although i generally admire entrepreneurs who build giant companies , rupert murdoch , despite giving us homer simpson , generally has not been a force for good over the course of his long career his bill o 'reillyed , glenn becked fox news has done a great deal to coarsen the political discourse his tabloids have lowered the standards of journalism on three continents and routinely broken the law on at least one of them he had dumbed down his prestige papers , like the times of london he has run roughshod over crossownership rules meant to prevent one man or company from having too much power and then used his lobbying might to get those rules diluted he has put kowtowing to china ahead of freedom of the press , even set to be published by his harpercollins unit that the chinese authorities objected to he has consistently used his media properties to reward allies and punish enemies it s a long list throughout his career , murdoch has never just been satisfied with besting the competition , as most decent businessmen are he s not truly happy unless he has his foot on a competitor s neck and is pressing it downward felix salmon , a blogger for reuters , about an executive who ran one of murdoch s more obscure divisions i will destroy you , the man told a competitor , according to the testimony i work for a man who wants it all and does n't understand anybody telling him he ca n't have it all one feature of murdoch s career is that he s never played by the rules that apply to other businessmen that s one reason i think he seems so shellshocked in those paparazzi photographs unable in this dire circumstance to make his own rules , he simply does n't know how to react or what to do on tuesday , when he is excoriated , it will be the first time he has ever truly been held to account it undoubtedly wo n't be fun for him but there are many people who are going to take great glee in his misery not unlike the way his newspapers have always taken such glee in the misery of others in the emails i trade back and forth with friends , we ca n't stop marveling at the scandal , at the headspinning twists and turns it s the best kind of story , one wrote me , because none of us really knows how it ends all we can do is read the paper every day , searching for more malicious gossip

the decisive referendum vote to repeal the bill that would limit collective bargaining by public sector unions has changed the political landscape in ohio tuesday s vote on senate bill 5 could and should be a harbinger for the 2012 presidential election by mounting a direct assault on public sector workers and the unions who represent them , gov john r kasich of ohio may have done more to help barack obama win reelection than anything obama s political team is likely to do over the next 12 months with ohio s continuing high unemployment rate \( 91 ! , just like the rest of the us \) , it had seemed unlikely that president obama could win ohio , and without ohio , he d have difficulty getting reelected the same factors make reelection a challenge for senator sherrod brown , an ohio democratic and one of the most prolabor members of the senate but kasich , the republicans in the ohio legislature and outside conservative financers and think tanks like the buckeye institute , may have done obama and brown a big favor karl rove described senate bill 5 as a much more extensive reform to public sector unions than was enacted in wisconsin , in part because the ohio version included firefighters and police officers while the protests in columbus were smaller and received less national attention than those in madison , unions and community groups in ohio organized a ballot initiative with 10 , 000 volunteers circulating petitions in all 88 counties over 13 million ohioans more than five times the number required to put the initiative on the ballot signed the petitions despite a large influx of money from conservative organizations like citizens united , freedom works , and restoring america , ohio voters repealed senate bill 5 by an overwhelming 22 point margin 39 yes , 61 no \( a no vote was prounion \) democrats and independents voted overwhelmingly against the measure , and , if preelection polls are correct , 30 of ohio republicans also voted to reject senate bill 5 this should be good news for obama while ohio is notorious for swinging back and forth between supporting republicans and democrats , its 18 electoral votes are especially important for republican candidates it s almost impossible for a republican to win the presidential election without ohio , and that means winning significant support among union household voters according to cnn exit polls from the last few elections , union household voters remain a strong presence in ohio , even after more than three decades of deindustrialization twentyeight percent of ohio voters come from union households , compared with 23 percent nationally in 2008 , they underperformed for obama , who won 56 percent of their votes in ohio versus 59 percent from union households across the country no similar data exists for the 2010 midterm election , but many labor leaders admit that kasich beat the democratic governor , ted strickland , in part because voters from community groups and union households either voted republican or stayed home \( essentially giving half a vote to kasich \) if union households in ohio lost their enthusiasm for democratic candidates in recent years , kasich s actions , together with the national republicans justsayno politics and killmedicare initiatives \( like the paul ryan budget \) , have made the democrats look a lot better than they did in 2010 it all comes down to math in 2008 , 2 , 933 , 388 ohioans voted \( or 515 \) for obama , 258 , 897 more than mccain won if union households maintain their proportion of the electorate , and if just 1 percent more of them vote for democrats , they can add 15 , 700 votes to the democratic vote and subtract the same number from the republicans a swing of more than 31 , 000 votes if ohio s union household voters increase their support for democrats by 3 percent that is , if they match the national average for union household voters they would generate 47 , 100 additional votes for obama , a swing of 94 , 200 votes that alone could give the president ohio s electoral votes but because of senate bill 5 , we might reasonably expect an even larger shift a recent quinnipiac poll suggests that the anger generated by the antiunion bill and the organizing fostered by the effort to overturn it has 70 percent of union household voters planning to support obama and the democrats in 2012 that translates into an increase of 219 , 829 votes for obama , a swing of almost 440 , 000 votes put differently , a mobilized ohio labor movement with 742 , 000 members , including many teachers , police officers , and firefighters who have often voted republican , will be more likely to vote for democrats in 2012 this gives obama the opportunity to score a big victory in ohio , but that won t happen solely on the basis of senate bill 5 the president must offer a positive economic vision and a program for economic change the american jobs act even if it must be pushed through piecemeal is a good start , as are the president s recent actions on mortgages and student loans such positions will also help senator brown s chances of reelection , but in 2012 , in ohio at least , the usual pattern of members of congress benefiting from presidential coattails could be reversed brown s solid support for organized labor , community groups and those who have been most hurt by the continuing economic crisis positions that resonate with the millions of ohio voters who overturned senate bill 5 may help obama more than anything obama has done will help brown none of this is guaranteed , of course in order for the battle over senate bill 5 to influence the 2012 election , those who have organized so effectively to defend unions must continue to work together unions will have to keep educating members and reach out to those outside of the labor movement they will also have to work closely with community and neighborhood groups like the ohio organizing collaborative , which played a pivotal role in community organizing around senate bill 5 none of that will be easy competing interests within and between organized labor and community organizations make the coalition very fragile the aflcio is relatively weak in ohio , and some tensions exist between public and private sector unions meanwhile , ohio republicans are threatening to put parts of senate bill 5 through in a series of smaller bills next year without solidarity across labor organizations , the coalition that fought so well against one big bill could fracture it may be that other issues won t have the unifying effect of senate bill 5 after all , the same voters who overturned that bill approved a constitutional amendment barring the implementation of the individual insurance mandate of the patient protection and affordable health care act but if the organizers of the campaign against senate bill 5 can hold together and if the obama campaign can tap into the anger and solidarity of that fight , tuesday s vote could turn out to be the turning point in the 2012 election john russo is a professor of labor studies and codirector of the center for workingclass studies at youngstown state

when a young man gets out of prison , society has an interest in keeping him out helping him to live a lawabiding life benefits everyone the excon and his family and friends , the people who might otherwise have become his victims , and taxpayers , as a year in prison usually costs upwards of 30 , 000 we know that states rarely offer former prisoners the help they need to change their lives , such as drug treatment , job search help , stable housing or schooling what s less widely known is that all over the country , states give newly released prisoners something that immediately sabotages their chances of going straight a bill for hundreds or thousands of dollars in court costs that they must pay or risk going back to prison in massachusetts , the average offender sentenced for a crime owes around 1 , 000 by the time he completes probation some of these are court costs , but probation adds to the bill , as the offender has to pay 50 or 65 a month to cover the costs of being supervised it creates a sense of i m never going to get out from under this debt , said bobby constantino , a former prosecutor in roxbury district court , in a highcrime area of boston courts need money so shouldn t we get it from the people who are making courts necessary to begin with , the criminals \? not the way we re doing it now state legislatures that impose fees calculate how much money they bring in , but seldom look at the costs of collecting them it is high enough so that the fees often end up costing the state more than they produce they take up the time of probation and parole officers numerous collectionassociated court dates burden the courts most important , these fees increase the chance that people will end up back behind bars either for failure to pay , or because the need to find a lot of money right away pushes people back into crime every state hands prisoners its own version of this bill states have become heavily dependent on these fees a recent report on the problem by the brennan center for justice at new york university lists prison and jail fees , postage fees , judgment fees , police drug fees , dna detection fees , prison construction fees , fees for the cost of collecting the debt some states have dozens of different fees so how does a young man newly out of jail , with very few job prospects , suddenly come up with a thousand dollars \? perhaps by utilizing the same skills that landed him in prison to begin with it pushes folks towards illicit sources of income , constantino said after two years as a prosecutor in roxbury , constantino was sick of the revolving door i would watch them come out other side more in debt , less employable , he said it seemed like the system was taking a bad problem and making it worse constantino left the district attorney s office in 2005 to do volunteer work with teens and families in dorchester , another highcrime area of boston but he continued to think about the problem and realized that buried in it was an opportunity debt was an overwhelming worry for people getting out of prison perhaps that need could bring them into a program that could help them get their lives back on track in 2008 , he went to judge edward redd , the first justice of the roxbury court , and asked if judges would agree to give defendants credit for their debts if they completed a program that might help keep them from reoffending he called it the clapham set , a homage to the clapham sect , a group of 19 th century abolitionists since then , roxbury has had two new first justices both signed off i get asked every day if i will waive fees for suchandsuch reason , said david weingarten , the current first justice he often agrees the probationer may still owe 100 on an 800 bill but desperately needs his driver license to get to a job , for example what clapham set is doing is trying to memorialize it and put some structure to it constantino designed a course that uses books , articles , poetry and music about the lives of innercity young men , designed to get young men thinking about how they are perpetuating a cycle of violence , and to sour the legitimacy of underground employment , he said he approached several young men at court they were all eager to take the course if it could get rid of their debt one was carlos l , who was 23 when he met constantino early last year he had served two years on drug and weapons charges during his probation he visited family members , earning two new charges exconvicts are not supposed to go back to the old neighborhood carlos was billed 300 in lawyers fees and victim witness fees carlos s 300 debt , low by massachusetts standards , was enormous to him he enthusiastically agreed to show up at class then instantly regretted it honestly , i didn t think i d last i didn t feel so comfortable , he said he kept going because he needed the fees waived but i found they were talking about stuff very related to people like me and the way i grew up he stuck with it the clapham set works with two groups already involved with this revolvingdoor population the black ministerial alliance of greater boston and the streetsafe boston initiative of the boston foundation suzanne brent of clapham set herself the mother of two boys who have had brushes with the law works with each man to help him get into school or into a first job , find stable housing , get his license back , get rehab or anger management classes for carlos , particularly helpful was brent s coaching in social skills dealing with different people and different environments it got me ready , he said when necessary , brent also buys the men shirts that button , real shoes and public transit passes , or loans them a cellphone for a month , so they can give potential employers a way to call back perhaps the most important service is brent s personal contacts with potential employers the men end up dropping 30 resumes at cvs , home depot , gas stations , and they always hear we re not hiring they come to us very frustrated , brent said they aren t going to get a job by sending in an application so she goes and talks to businesses one that has been heroically receptive is boston common coffee , a chain of three stores and a roasting plant owned by peter femino femino , who met brent because she was a regular customer , has hired about 10 men in the clapham set program one lasted a day a few do fine for a while , then disappear there s one person i brought back three times , he said he said that to his knowledge , none of the men have stolen anything when there is a problem it is usually that they just stop coming to work femino called brent a few times , telling her that he s about to fire another one but he always asks her to send him the next good applicant i m always willing to give someone a chance to make a change in their lives , he said the chain s most successful clapham set employee so far is carlos he started a year ago as a dishwasher , and now is the supervisor of the middle kitchen , responsible for sandwiches , at the chain s busiest store he was new to managing people , but femino said he learned quickly we had a few incidents where there was a flareup , and he kind of threw gasoline on the fire rather than put it out , femino said we sat him down and told him how it should be handled he needs to be the person who calms everyone down and puts everything in perspective if someone is yelling , he can t yell now he s done that he s changed i would trust him as much or more than any other employee carlos said there are a lot of things he likes about the job it keeps me out of trouble , he said in general i like the people i work with i like the everyday customers i love my boss sometimes it can be frustrating you re dealing with a lot of people and you ve got to stay focused but i know where i came from and how far i came some times i wake up and don t feel like going to work but i still go , because i have to he is now supporting three children , and feels a bit like an old man with his friends i still hang out with my friends and they say , how are you doing this \? i give them a couple of words of wisdom on carlos s recommendation , one of his friends now works in the store as well three years into the clapham set , 26 men ages 16 to midtwenties have gone through the program about 20 have found work although some didn t last very long so far only five have landed in prison again this is promising in massachusetts , just over half of all exconvicts reoffend in the first three years in 11 cases , the program deemed the men s progress good enough to ask the judges to waive their debts one was carlos clapham set shows that the idea is feasible , but it s too small to draw conclusions about how well it works constantino is now in new york , working at the vera institute of justice , which is trying to get the money to start a larger demonstration project , one big enough to be evaluated the clapham set program is a way to turn a problem into an opportunity to focus the attention of a group of people who desperately need help it can help states save money and help young people to change their lives on friday i ll explore this idea further and look at other ways this template might be used  join and follow updates on  tina

new orleans two days had passed before the family of brenting dolliole learned that he was dead when his battered body was found by the police , on the saturday after thanksgiving , he was simply john doe but he was not just any john doe mr dolliole , who was 22 , was the 175th homicide victim in new orleans this year , a tally that matched the previous year s homicide count , but with more than a month before 2011 was out since , there have been eight more victims , including two men shot dead in a pickup truck , two shot dead in a sedan and another shot on the street in broad daylight of all the challenges facing the city of new orleans , none is as urgent or as relentlessly grim as the city s homicide rate it was measured at 10 times the national average in 2010 , long before shootings on halloween night in the crowded french quarter revealed to a larger public what was going on in poor neighborhoods around the city every week there were 51 homicides per 100 , 000 residents here last year , compared with less than 7 per 100 , 000 in new york or 23 in similarsize oakland , calif from september of last year to february of this year , said mayor in a recent speech , after reciting a litany of killings from one city high school , a student attending john mcdonogh was more likely to be killed than a soldier in afghanistan as it happens , the mayor was picked to be a jury member in a murder trial this week it ended with a deadlocked jury new orleans has long been a violent town in 1994 , there were 421 killings here , one of which was a hit ordered by a police officer with federal intervention , the homicide rate dropped precipitously but began rising again around 2000 and has been fluctuating since the killers and their victims are overwhelmingly young black men , according to an analysis of homicide cases by outside experts last march , and sponsored by the federal bureau of justice assistance as police officials frequently point out to the anger of some families , most victims and offenders had prior contacts with the police , often for violent crimes less than a quarter were listed as having a steady job the narrower causes are less clear there are no large organized gangs in town , nor are there major drug wars , though some killings are turf disputes over the drug market , made worse by the drastic reshuffling of the urban poor after hurricane katrina and the demolition of public housing projects many killings in new orleans are a result of conflicts and vendettas among small , loosely organized groups , the analysis concluded , but in nearly half the cases , the experts listed the primary motive as uncertain or unknown only about half the homicide cases are cleared city officials have been pushing what they call a public health approach , a paradigm shift , they say , in a city that has been known for soaring arrest and incarceration rates working off a program that started in milwaukee , the city is to analyze past killings and try to prevent violence businessmen have pledged to find work for people returning from prison a few hundred volunteers have begun training to set up neighborhood watches or become mentors the city has also announced that it is adopting a chicago program that recruits people who have experience in violent neighborhoods and sends them out to counsel and intervene most of these efforts are in the early stages people working on the front lines say they welcome a focus on a public health approach but it is not hard to find those who are skeptical as to whether these efforts will have sufficient scale , financing or community involvement people are sitting around waiting , waiting , waiting all this is talk , said norris henderson , a founder of a group for former prisoners called  fighting the homicide epidemic is doubly hard with a police department already known for corruption and facing a major federal overhaul for nearly a year officials from the department of justice have been in with city officials over the terms of a consent decree , a legally binding blueprint for reform while that overhaul is being mapped out , scores of new orleans police officers have been convicted , charged , terminated or pushed to resign over abuses , coverups or in some cases killings this week began the federal trial of two officers who are charged with lying about the shooting of a man after hurricane katrina the police superintendent himself has been tied to several controversies , and though he has been cleared of wrongdoing by the city inspector general , some have called for his resignation what remains is a serious breach of trust between the police and residents in the poorer wards of the city , many of whom feel that the authorities are more problem than solution , and so are more inclined to settle their troubles on their own settlements that can often involve firearms they do not trust the police , said , who served time for manslaughter and drug charges in his youth , but has since become an actor and a community activist when these people are looking for help , they 're looking for inside help but the drumbeat of discipline and bad publicity has also undermined the morale of some police officers , who say privately that they feel like they are constantly being secondguessed budget pressures and staffing shortages have not helped it s created this paralyzed , passive police department , said peter scharf , a professor of criminology at tulane university the police superintendent , ronal w serpas , disputes that there is widespread discouragement within the department , though he acknowledges that cleaning up the force is a long , difficult and unfinished process he points to various signs , like a 17 percent increase in the number of people calling into a tip line , that residents are steadily regaining faith in the police 2011 has been a year consumed by rebuilding all the infrastructure in the department that had collapsed , said mr serpas , who had earlier set a goal of a 5 percent reduction in the homicide rate for the year with grants and a bigger budget next year , he said , the department will be expanding community policing programs , adding homicide detectives and using more sophisticated tools to analyze crime trends the homicide problem in new orleans is not unique , said prof david m kennedy of john jay college of criminal justice in new york , the author of do n't shoot one man , a street fellowship , and the end of violence in innercity america the city is not alone in having a tense relationship between the police and the citizenry , nor is its pattern of violence driven by conflicts among small groups , and carried out by an especially violent subset of those groups particularly rare and , professor kennedy added , there are existing , proven methods to bring the homicide rate down there is the deep and tragic misunderstanding between the three main parties involved , he said , describing his theory of how violence works in just about any american city you 've got the cops and you 've got the neighborhoods and you 've got the guys on the street the killing stops because you undo those dynamics mr dolliole s killing was different from many of the others it did not involve a firearm , for one , and mr dolliole was not caught up in any feuds , family members said , other than being in an abusive relationship with his male partner but he was like many others in that he was black , he was young and he had spent some time in jail since the killing , the family had one meeting set up with a detective she failed to show , the family said , calling five hours later to say she had been delayed by another homicide they spoke by phone for half an hour no one in the family has heard from anyone since a police spokesman said on wednesday that the detective was working on the case though there were no suspects it s like it s just been swept under the rug , said brenting s younger brother , brian he s just another body in the city of new orleans
awarta , west bank in the rolling hills of the northern , villages and israeli settlements exist in a geographical intimacy that belies decades of mutual hostility , suspicion and fear here neighbors are also enemies , and the brutal killing of five members of the fogel family in the settlement of itamar three weeks ago has done nothing but harden that division the israeli military and security services have focused their search for the suspected killers in awarta , the palestinian village next door the army has repeatedly raided the village , searching homes , forcing doors and breaking furniture , residents said hundreds have been arrested , they said , and about two dozen remain in custody awarta lies a few hundred yards across a valley from itamar , and the villagers say the settlement and its satellite outposts are built on their confiscated lands , in territory that israel has occupied since the 1967 war itamar is surrounded by a security fence that the assailants apparently scaled that friday night contact between the two communities is limited to occasional confrontations in the fields , and residents said that settlers stoned houses on the edge of the village the day after the murders yet residents of awarta , who denounced the killings , said they did not believe that anyone from their village could be responsible for such an act standing outside his house on the edge of the village , across from the distant row of houses where the fogels lived , asad abd alkarim lolah , 70 , said it was impossible for any palestinian muslim arab to have committed that crime the march 11 killings , which occurred late on the sabbath eve , were reviled by all israelis , regardless of their politics the victims included parents in their 30s , two young children and a baby who were stabbed and slashed to death in their beds the israeli authorities have not revealed any details of their investigation , other than to say it is continuing but the night after the killings the israeli military s regional brigade commander , col nimrod aloni , told reporters that the event seemed to be something local about 2 am on march 12 , some two hours after the bodies were found , israeli troops invaded awarta , according to the deputy mayor , hassan awad the village , a few miles south of the city of nablus , was put under curfew for the next four days and was divided into four sections , with soldiers taking over a house in each quarter as a military post all men and boys over age 15 had to report to the posts , where they were questioned , fingerprinted and given mouth swabs for dna testing , mr awad said residents said at least half of the 1 , 500 homes have been searched of the 7 , 000 people in the village about 300 have been arrested , mr awad said , adding that while most were released within days , some 25 males between the ages of about 18 and 45 remained in detention on monday mr awad said he did not know of any arrests or raids in villages other than awarta no charges have been filed the palestinian government media center took reporters to awarta last week , primarily to highlight the damage wrought by the israeli army children cried and ran away in fright at the sight of strangers mr lolah , who had two sons aged 30 and 33 in detention , said the soldiers had raided his house four times and left nothing untouched according to the islamic calendar the itamar killings took place a year almost to the day after two 19yearold cousins from awarta , muhammad qawariq and salah qawariq , were shot dead by israeli soldiers on the village lands at the time the israeli military said the cousins had tried to attack a soldier with a pitchfork and an ax after an investigation the military admitted that the shooting was unnecessary , and that if the soldiers had operated in a more professional manner they could have avoided the need to open fire muhammad qawariq s father , faisal mahmoud masar qawariq , said his house had been raided seven times since the killings at itamar four of his sons were rounded up and two of them , aged 21 and 24 , were still in detention my son was murdered while he was working the land , mr qawariq said we have a lawsuit against the israeli army in the israeli courts this is why they are targeting us the dingy , sparsely furnished interior of the house , with bare cementblock walls and a bare cement floor , attests to the family s poverty mr qawariq , who has seven surviving children and is unemployed , said the soldiers broke all the closets and the family s first , newly acquired washing machine even so , he said , whoever committed the crime in itamar deserves the harshest punishment echoing other palestinians residents here he said it was not in their culture or tradition to kill children , but settler leaders have circulated what they say is a partial list detailing nearly a dozen palestinian terrorist attacks over the past decade in which a score of israeli children have been killed , including two , aged 12 and 15 , who were shot in their home in itamar in 2002 although none of the residents of awarta who were interviewed had ever set foot in itamar , some settlers are familiar with awarta some have visited at night , under the protection of the army , to pray at shrines traditionally believed to be the burial sites of the family of the biblical prophet aaron mr awad , the deputy mayor , said israeli peace groups had come to the village last year to show solidarity after the two youths were killed but he said no settlers from itamar had made contact , nor would they have been welcomed if they had
three men who kidnapped and hid a busload of california schoolchildren in a 1976 ransom attempt are up for parole again , and this time , they have the support of the judge , prosecutors and investigators who handled their notorious case their supporters held a rally in san francisco on wednesday to call for the release of fred woods and the brothers richard and jim schoenfeld the three were convicted of commandeering a bus of 26 children and their driver near chowchilla , in the san joaquin valley , and hiding them underground in a rock quarry the victims escaped after 36 hours , and none were seriously injured
an irate correspondent is furious with me for dismissing herman cain s ideas cain s program , he angrily asserts , has been endorsed by none other than arthur laffer , a much smarter economist than you indeed , laffer capped his brilliant career two years ago by warning , presciently , that interest rates would soar thanks to the obama plan but seriously or as seriously as anything involving cain can get jared bernstein has a good summary of the reality of nein , nein , nein the key point is that each of the nines is a tax that would more or less fully fall on middleincome families , who in addition to paying 9 percent of their income in taxes would find their living costs 9 percent higher and their wages 9 percent lower that s a 27 percent tax , way above the average federal taxes now paid by middleincome households so the cain plan amounts to a huge tax increase on most americans , but a huge tax cut on the wealthy
washington the toughest legislative negotiations always resemble those old movies in which a terrified and helpless damsel lies bound to the railroad tracks at the last instant , a hero intervenes to stop the locomotive it happened with tax reform in the 1980s , deficit reduction in the '90s , and the health care overhaul last year odds remain good that because of the immense pressure for action on all involved , the pattern will repeat itself this week on raising the and averting a default by the united states government but washington s capacity to recreate that narrative arc faces an unusually demanding test one set of reasons involves the continuing evolution of the american political culture in ways that make bipartisan compromise more difficult in 2008 , , as a presidential candidate , made changing that culture a signature objective if anything , it has grown more dysfunctional during his presidency another set involves specific nearterm circumstances and the characters attempting to resolve the crisis the house speaker , john a boehner , has lived through many political storms during two decades in congress his relatively inexperienced leadership team , and the ideologically ardent freshmen in his caucus , have not has earned the gray spreading through his hair since reaching washington in 2005 his chief of staff , william m daley , is in his seventh month on the job after a 10year absence from washington none of the institutional players hold power securely the democratic president , the democratic senate , the republican house each could get tossed out in the 2012 elections as all three reach for a solution , their margin for error has grown very small what most complicates the chances for compromise is the broad political realignment that has played out over the decades since world war ii once , partisan differences were blurred by intraparty factions in a democratic caucus with southern conservatives and a republican caucus with northern liberals now , partisan and ideological boundaries are powerfully selfreinforcing a doublelayered great wall of division , buttressed by fundraising patterns and gerrymandered house districts a national journal analysis of voting patterns earlier this year showed the trend essentially perfected the 2010 record of the most liberal senate republican lay to the right of the most conservative senate democrat the attitudes of average voters are not quite that polarized but they are nearly so the ascendant methods by which they receive political information cable television , the internet , twitter reinforce divisions in a crisis , skilled leadership and fortuitous circumstances can overcome them that happened in the fall of 2008 when congress passed the 700 billion wall street bailout the request then came from a republican president , with strong freemarket credentials , whose term was nearly over democrats controlled both chambers of congress and were heading toward election day positioned to gain strength even then , passage came only after one marketrattling floor defeat this time , the probailout votes cast by many incumbents make them doubly gunshy about supporting a debt limit increase senate democrats , with at least 10 incumbent seats in jeopardy , could easily lose their majority next year house republicans could lose theirs too after taking a big risk by overhauling in their budget plan , they have doubled their bet on the debt limit mr obama , too , is vulnerable he hopes to repeat the deftness that president bill clinton displayed in facing down the speaker then , newt gingrich , and securing a second term in 1996 mr clinton benefited from the prior congressional experience of leon e panetta , who was his white house chief of staff and is now mr obama s defense secretary at the moment , some senior democrats on capitol hill believe mr obama misses the legislative savvy of his former chief of staff , rahm emanuel , now the mayor of chicago similarly , some veteran house republicans fret that the young guns of their leadership team may lack the ability to command the votes of recalcitrant caucus members the way tom the hammer delay , as majority leader , and roy blunt of missouri , as whip , did during the bush era institutional strains between the house and the senate , which do cross party lines , add another wild card that much was clear when a fallback plan written by the top senate republican , mitch mcconnell , yielded no support from house republicans the influenced house caucus poses the biggest obstacle because so many members have declared themselves impervious to normal political pressures disdaining the white house , the senate , wall street and reelection concerns all at once , they reflect the declining confidence in established institutions that has transformed political debate for a halfcentury as the first unsuccessful bailout vote showed in 2008 , legislative leaders sometimes bring critical measures to the floor without knowing for certain where all the votes lie even a slight miscalculation , at the white house or the capitol , could produce a devastating financial market reaction the race to brake the locomotive of economic chaos proceeds hour by hour now and as senator saxby chambliss of georgia , a republican member of the socalled gang of six , said on the cbs news program face the nation on sunday , frankly , we do n't know what s going to happen for sure
eric chavez s eighthinning , runscoring single sunday night did not end the ' victory over the texas rangers , but it might as well have once the yankees had the lead and the inning was over , the next step for manager joe girardi was to summon from the bullpen the most foregone conclusion in baseball is 41 years old he is in his 17th major league season his arsenal of pitches remains limited , with few exceptions , to one the cut fastball and in spite of all of those factors , any one of which could end the career of most major leaguers , rivera is good enough to reduce his hardened general manager to a gushing fan he s incredible , brian cashman , the yankees gm , said by phone monday he s been the most valuable yankee we 've had during this run when tiger woods was dominating golf for so long , we used to say , he s tiger woods' but he still is he s just continued to dominate in the major leagues , year after year , for an entire generation that s just phenomenal what rivera was doing five years ago , at age 36 , was phenomenal the fact that he is still doing it now , at age 41 , is unheard of has posted a regularseason earned run average under 200 in seven of the last eight years in nine appearances this year , he has yet to allow a run he has given up four hits , walked none , struck out seven and converted each of his seven save opportunities on sunday night he was absolutely baffling to the three rangers he faced in the ninth inning his trademark cutter hummed between 91 and 92 miles per hour and broke sharply and late in the strike zone , darting across the heart of the plate while the righthanded hitters ian kinsler and elvis andrus jumped out of the way of called strikes rivera needed 16 pitches , 10 of them strikes , to retire the side and lock up his 566th career save only the former padres closer trevor hoffman , with 601 , has more career saves rivera could surpass him this year , and if he does not , he has one more year left on the contract he signed in the offseason and while cashman would not say that the yankees gave rivera a twoyear deal without hesitation , he is not high on cashman s list of concerns of course you hesitate because of the age and stuff , cashman said but clearly , if you can trust anybody in the game , it s mariano rivera s value to the yankees has gone beyond the ninth inning he has been a mentor to younger pitchers and players he offers motivational talks to struggling relievers while they shag fly balls during daily batting practice he encourages young latin players to give their interviews in english rather than through an interpreter , and encourages reporters to learn spanish so as to communicate better in return but as strong a clubhouse presence as he may be , rivera s brilliance lies in his sustained greatness in a profession that defies longevity most elite closers do not stay on top for more than a couple of years at a time rivera has been a top closer since 1997 even those who are close with rivera are not certain how he does it i have no idea , dude , cashman said it s the most amazing thing a child out of a little fishing village in panama who has just one pitch i mean , one pitch if you were to write a story like that , it would be an amazing story and he s living it , and we get to watch it inside pitch reliever pedro feliciano , who said last week that he would most likely have seasonending surgery to repair the torn posterior capsule in his left shoulder , will put off an operation for now feliciano was examined in pensacola , fla , by dr james andrews , who recommended a sixweek program of a shoulder strengthening instead of surgery
manchester , nh mitt romney enters the republican presidential debate on tuesday as the likeliest target of questions and criticism from rivals eager to slow the building sense of momentum behind his campaign the dynamics of the race have shifted considerably since the last debate , just three weeks ago until then , mr romney largely managed to float above the fray during the televised debates and when he did engage as he did during the last debate with rick perry , the texas governor mr romney won most of those encounters mr perry , who was then leading the other republican candidates in the polls , was the focus of attention during the last several debates but his stumbling performances during those contests and other articles in the news media have blunted his fast start in the last several polls , mr romney has retaken the lead but with that lead comes new and sometimes unwanted attention and scrutiny that was made clear over the weekend as mr romney s critics renewed their assault on his stance on social issues and several of the republican candidates dodged questions about the relevance of mr romney s mormon faith , after a prominent pastor referred to the mormon church as a cult and said that mr romney was not a christian the event on tuesday night will be the first time the candidates have debated sitting down perhaps an effort by the sponsors to encourage a serious discussion they will be seated according to poll results , and that means mr romney and herman cain , the former chief executive of godfather s pizza , will be next to each other the debate is being sponsored by bloomberg news and the washington post and will start at 8 pm eastern time it will be on bloomberg television , bloomberg radio , bloombergcom and wbintv in new hampshire it will also be livestreamed at postpoliticscom the candidates have also been told that they will be able to ask each other questions , and that the order will go alphabetically , with representative michele bachmann of minnesota starting that means several of the candidates will get a chance for questions before mr romney or mr perry , who will come near the end here are five things to watch for on tuesday night 1 the mormon question mr romney may get a break on this given that the debate is supposed to be focused entirely on economics that suggests that none of the questions being prepared by bloomberg or the post will be about mr romney s faith but debates are unpredictable it is not impossible to imagine another candidate raising the issue in an oblique way it is also possible that one of the moderators might see fit to ask one of mr romney s rivals whether they think a discussion about mormonism distracts from the important economic issues facing the country if the issue of faith does come up , look for mr romney to try and deflect it quickly his advisers say he has addressed it and wants to move on one person likely to be outspoken in a discussion of mr romney s faith is jon m huntsman jr , the former utah governor and a fellow mormon he called the whole issue a sideshow on monday 2 romney , the pi ata if mr romney is able to escape a discussion of his faith , he is not likely to be so lucky on other issues , in particular health care mr perry and the other candidates know there is a danger that republicans will start coalescing around mr romney if they judge him to be the most likely to win in a race against mr obama so they have begun attacking his credentials as a conservative , reviving the critique that mr romney has changed positions frequently and is not authentic in his beliefs mr perry introduced a brutal web video on monday showing president obama looking in the mirror and seeing mr romney s reflection michele bachmann swiped at mr romney last week , urging voters in iowa not to settle for someone who is not a true conservative but nowhere is the attack more likely than on health care , as mr perry s video showed and health care in america is a legitimate economic issue that moderators of the debate are sure to address 3 battle of the executives among the more interesting dynamics to watch on tuesday may be the interplay between mr romney and herman cain , a former chief executive of godfather s pizza mr cain has surged in the polls recently , taking second place in several surveys asked about mr cain s appeal during a townhallstyle meeting on monday evening , mr romney said he thought it was the fact that both men had spent time outside of government , in business mr romney is not likely to lash out at mr cain during the debate despite mr cain s recent popularity , mr romney s advisers do not see him as a longterm threat to winning the nomination but mr cain has proven himself to be a formidable presence in speeches to conservative activists and he is not unwilling to be blunt in his criticism of mr romney or his other rivals it is possible that mr cain , sensing an opportunity in the moment , could pile on mr romney 4 perry , race and expectations one candidate likely to benefit from the economic focus of the debate is mr perry , at least when it comes to the race issue since the last debate , a washington post article about a hunting camp where mr perry hosted guests that had a racial epithet painted on a rock at its entrance has forced mr perry s campaign off message in a normal debate , it would be an obvious topic to ask him to address it is possible , as with mr romney s religion , that another candidate will ask mr perry about the hunting camp if so , mr perry will most likely try to use the national platform to offer the explanations his campaign has given in the past that the rock was painted over before he started going there but even if he does escape questions about race or the hunting camp , mr perry still may not be out of the woods in the last three debates , he got dismal reviews for appearing unprepared on several crucial issues and losing his focus his campaign has said that this time he is devoting more time to preparation and trying to get more sleep economic focus or not , the moderators and the other republican campaigns are sure to try to test mr perry to see whether he turns in a better performance , substantively and stylistically if he does , it may help turn around his campaign if he has another bad night , it could further set back his fundraising and his efforts to woo activists and establishment republicans to his campaign 5 jobs and mr obama the economy should be the star of the show on tuesday night , however , and that is likely to provide plenty of opportunity for all of the republican candidates to criticize mr obama in townhallstyle meetings in new hampshire on monday , mr romney continued to call mr obama a failed president and accused him of not understanding how the economy worked expect him to do more of the same mr perry has repeatedly suggested that his experience as governor of texas for a decade gives him unique qualifications to help the economy and he has criticized mr obama s policies as wrongheaded and ineffective mrs bachmann is likely to be joined by the others on the stage ron paul , newt gingrich , and rick santorum in assailing mr obama s administration for actions they say have hurt the country s economic chances those include the bank bailouts , the stimulus program , the health care reform law , the doddfrank efforts to regulate the banking industry and environmental regulations expect all of them to come up during the debate the question remains , however , whether any of the candidates will find the right recipe for criticizing the president and knocking their republican rivals at the same time if they do , it is sure to be memorable
port gamble s'klallam reservation , wash the canoe journeys are a new tradition for a very old people , but they already have one rigid rule that everyone knows not to break that thing you are paddling is called a canoe do not call it something else if you call it a boat , said mariah francis , 16 , of the lower elwha klallam tribe , you 're either supposed to jump in the water or you 'll get thrown in and as paddlers are reminded each year , the water here is cold for the 23rd summer in a row , a growing number of american indians from tribes scattered across coastal regions of washington state and british columbia have climbed into traditionally designed cedar canoes and paddled as many as 40 miles a day , sometimes more , over two or three weeks , camping at a series of reservations until they converge at the home of a host tribe there , several thousand people welcome them for a week of traditional dancing , singing and celebration they come from remote outposts like la push , on the pacific ocean , and from wealthier tribes whose casinos rise above interstate 5 north of seattle , all in a deliberate effort to recapture cultural , linguistic and intertribal connections they said they had nearly lost as indian ways of life were overwhelmed , first by european settlers and more recently by substance abuse and suicide the first time we landed , the feeling was just unexplainable , said charlie trevathan , a tribal member here in port gamble whose family first joined the journey in 2000 i cannot put it into words ever since then , we 've gone back every year now his extended family , like many , has became a canoe family , with its own cedar craft , familythemed red sweatshirts and flag mr trevathan , a commercial fisherman , makes a point every summer of putting the canoe journey before work , a deliberate reminder to himself that priorities once were very different among northwest natives there s a shrimp opener soon and the price is supposed to be way up , mr trevathan said , referring to a brief coming fishing season my wife says , 'are you going shrimping \? ' i said , 'my commitment is to the canoe' the money would be good but it s tribal journeys time while some paddlers begin at reservations on the ocean , all eventually touch some portion of what the federal government in 2009 renamed the salish sea , the body of water that includes the strait of georgia in canada , the strait of juan de fuca and puget sound the sea is the ancestral home of the coast salish people , who were not bound by the international border now at the 49th parallel before settlers arrived and built roads , the sea was how most people traveled and traded , wearing hats made from cedar and relying on paddles and canoes carved by hand it was the highway , the network that connected people throughout the region , said sasha harmon , an associate professor of american indian studies at the university of washington it was complicated after nonindian families settled here , but it never went away people had a really strong sense of the water connecting to them as a major force dr harmon said that as many indian tribes across the country have worked to preserve their cultures in recent decades , the canoe journeys have been notable for restoring and strengthening this intertribal communication , and that was a really important part of northwest culture when paddlers arrive at their destination each afternoon , they are greeted by members of the local tribe who paddle out to meet them tribes have revived rituals , what they now call protocol , to signal that they are visiting in peace there s a certain way they have to do it in order to show that they 're here in respect , not for war or destruction , said aurelia washington , the coordinator of the event for this year s host , the swinomish indian tribal community they 're saying , 'we come here to spend this week with you in celebration' starting monday , more than 100 canoes will spend the next week at the reservation , celebrating around three new pavilions designed to resemble giant traditional cedar hats the tribes will sing and dance directly across the swinomish channel from the little town of la conner , a quaint northwest port where retirees arrive in very different kinds of boats to dine on freshly caught fish and drink locally made beer and wine the cultural divisions in the region are apparent in the street that crosses the channel at one end it is called pioneer parkway , on the other reservation road but perhaps the most striking thing about the 2011 paddle to swinomish is that it is not a new beginning or a special anniversary instead , it reflects what so many of its participants say they had ached for before it existed constancy and reconnection often the main paddlers are teenagers and young men and women , with their parents and elders taking turns as well , transferring every few hours from support boats the entire event is intended to be free of alcohol and drugs that is something that our elders have been praying for , ms washington said , that our children would have a path forward without drugs and alcohol because we have battled so much among the paddlers who traveled the farthest this year was cleve jackson , the 16yearold son of shakey jackson , the chief of the quinault tribe on the west coast of the olympic peninsula shakey jackson was among several tribal members who worked to revive the canoe tradition years ago , studying seagoing canoes in museum exhibits and even those on display in a seattle restaurant , because none were left in their village now in his 40s , mr jackson lets his son do most of the paddling i'm trying to wean myself from the boat , mr jackson said shortly after cleve , who plays tight end and linebacker for taholah high school , led his crew to shore no one suggested that the chief should go for a swim photos canoes from tribes throughout the coastal northwest converged on the swinomish reservation , the host for this year s gathering for some , the journey involved weeks of paddling members of the ahousat tribe of vancouver island enjoyed a clambake at the port gamble s'klallam reservation en route to the gathering abby purcer , center photo , left , and shayla decoteau of the s'klallam welcomed the visitors with a hand gesture members of the warm strings tribe n'chi wanapum performed during the stopover with the s'klallam \( a9 \) an arriving tribe waited for permission to come ashore at the s'klallam reservation this is part of the ritual in which the host tribe greets the visiting canoe and welcomes the paddlers ashore dennis jones of the s'klallam tribe holding a talking stick , which is used in the greeting ritual at right , members of a visiting tribe carry their 1 , 200pound canoe to shore the journey culminates in a week of traditional dancing , singing and celebration \( photographs by michael hanson for the new york times \) \( a12 \) map
david waldstein s article this morning examines the wildly divergent styles of bill belichick and rex ryan on conference calls ryan is gregarious and always tries to throw in a few laughs some of belichick s answers can be just as funny , unintentionally so , as he refuses to open up or take any bait from reporters see for yourself transcript of bill belichick s conference call with reporters wednesday on how much better he feels the offense has been since going to a small ball approach i don t know every week is its own week we ll see how it goes this week we have our pluses and some minuses along the way , but in the end , none of that really matters it just comes down to how we do this week , so we ll see how it goes on some of the things that concern him most about the jets they re a good football team all the way across the board they re good on offense , defense \( and \) special teams \( they \) beat the colts in indianapolis we all know how tough that is everything concerns me they re good all the way across the board on whether he has noticed any difference in mark sanchez s play lately he s done a great job this year there have been a lot of close games and \( he has \) brought them from behind , like in the detroit game and the overtime games \( in \) cleveland , he made a bunch of big plays there he s done an excellent job in some tough situations and brought the team back and won for them i think anytime a quarterback does that , that s what you want on your r sum on whether he saw a change in the jets style of play after they got behind in the last game they played i think , if that s what they said , that s the answer to the question right there they re the ones that are on their side of the field they know what they were doing and how they felt and what they felt like they did , so i d go with that on whether he has any issue with how tom brady celebrates after a score no on how much he used pictures of the bills being fitted for super bowl rings as motivation when he was defensive coordinator for the giants i really don t even remember being aware of that story about the rings if it was , i ve forgotten about it , but i don t remember on four of the 12 playoff teams having general managers that worked under him at some point and what he tried to teach them about building a team i think those individuals are all very talented and they ve done a great job in their situations they did a great job in my association of working with them in different capacities along the way i think they , obviously , have done very well they did a great job for me each situation , each team , each one is a little bit different , so i think in the end , it comes down to just doing the right thing for your team , making good decisions and finding a way to put the best team on the field they ve all done a great job of that on whether he is proud of having people that work with him go on to success with other teams sure i have a lot of friends in the business at that end , on the coaching end , players that i ve coached and so forth , but when you compete against them on the field , then that s competition you have to put all that aside and compete then , when it s over , you can go back to resuming whatever degree of friendship you have there , as long as it doesn t conflict with the continued competitiveness of the situation on what he thinks of darrelle revis he s an excellent player he has had a great career and we ve seen him have a lot of great games against a lot of great receivers he competes very well against a lot of different receivers he did it again against the colts we know he s an outstanding player and we ll just do our best to compete against him on antonio cromartie s comments towards tom brady i m really trying to focus on getting our team ready to play on sunday on cromartie as a cornerback he s had a good career he played in san diego we saw him out there and \( then he \) came to the jets he s done a good job there he s a big corner who can run well and has good ball skills the play in the baltimore game , he made an excellent play on the ball and made a great kickoff return last week it was a huge play against indianapolis it really put the team in a close position to score and then they got a couple more firstdowns \( for \) the winning points he can hurt you in a lot of different ways he s a good football player on how much emotion goes into executing on game day there are so many things that go into executing on game day if you wrote a book , you still couldn t include all of them it s really a combination of a lot of things and how it all comes together it s a long game that takes place over threeplus hours whatever it is , a lot of things happen within that span of time how it all comes together is all very unique and that s what makes football such a great game emotions are a part of it and so are a million other things on deion branch saying the patriots made a lot of mistakes in their 453 win over the jets you ll have to ask deion about that specifically i think after every game there are always that you do well , hopefully , and there are things you don t do as well and need to correct or make adjustments to that s pretty common after every game the jets are a good football team they certainly cause a lot of problems we ve played four games since rex has been there we split on all four of them we made some plays , they made some plays in the end , both teams have won two games we know it s a very competitive situation there are things we always want to try to do better they give you problems in their schemes , their players , their coaching \( and \) in all three phases of the game , as i said earlier we have a lot of respect for them we know there are a lot of things we have to do well in order to come out on top on if you can coach emotion i think you try to coach a team the best that you can as is said , there s a million factors that go into that they are all important on if the game is personal to him we re going to do our best to win on sunday on if he s going to have a pregame race with coach ryan i think we ll do our best to win on sunday on the advantage of having many different personnel groupings i think in every game , you re always looking for matchups you try to create the ones that you feel give you an advantage and try to minimize the ones that you think don t give you an advantage or give your opponent an advantage however you want to look at it i think that s part of every game , whether it s offense , defense \( or \) special teams it really transcends through any sport you try to find matchups that are advantageous if you can find them , you try to utilize those and get the most out of them if you don t think that s the case , you try to move on to something that s better for you on how they ve used their two tight ends to create favorable matchups we try to do it with our whole team , it s all the players that are out there each of your linemen , each of your skill players , all of the guys on defense that you have to defend on the other side of the ball it s a constant challenge part of the competition is trying to put your players in a position where they can be successful on different plays and to try to do the same with your opponent \( you want \) to keep their playmakers from making a lot of plays against you on what it means to be a part of five 142 teams there s time to reflect on things , but right now i m just trying to focus on the jets and get ready for this sunday s game we can talk about all that other stuff late r by contrast , here is the transcript of rex ryan s news conference wednesday rex ryan opening remarks damien woody is going to be placed on ir he got an achilles injury in the other left leg it s really unfortunately he played almost the whole game at indianapolis i mentioned he was a little wobbly well , there was a reason it wasn t his knee , it s an achilles tendon , so he will be placed on ir today guys that did not practice today were brandon moore back , brad smith groin and patrick turner illness guys that were limited were santonio holmes quad , james ihedigbo knee ankle and darrelle revis hamstring guys that were full were antonio cromartie groin , ben hartsock back , nick mangold shoulder , sione pouha , back , tony richardson finger , mark sanchez right shoulder and bryan thomas ankle those are our injuries on the sweater vest tradition well , i was trying to cover up the boiler i thought that was the best way to do it laughter that s really where it came from i saw it and said , let s go with that on the fans in the stands copying the sweater vest style well , it s a style that should be copied it s a good look i could see why they would want to have that look laughing on when he found out woody was hurt he actually never finished it was on the last drive and he came out i never knew the extent of the injury obviously he didn t either i guess he s going to that surgery maybe this afternoon it s unfortunate he played great and played the whole game against robert mathis , who is a great player on how it feels to have woody hurt during last couple weeks of the season it s tough he worked his tail off to get back and then he had a great challenge against mathis he did a great job during that game now , getting ready to play his old team new england and what all that represents , it s tough we re fortunate i ve always said that we have the best backup tackle in the league in wayne hunter he s played a lot of football for us and we have a lot of confidence in wayne on if woody tore his achilles tendon i don t know on how far mark sanchez has come since last year it s huge his confidence is really huge i think that comes with his knowledge of the system , how he feels about his teammates and being able to recognize defenses he s way a head where he was last year on antonio cromartie s comments towards tom brady i think that language was a little strong for me laughing you shouldn t like who you are up against right now this is the playoffs i can tell you our whole football team respects brady and the patriots there s no question , but hey , we don t like any of them right now you shouldn t danny woodhead is a great kid , but i can t stand danny woodhead right now i think that s just part of it and trust me , the feeling is mutual mike tannenbaum is from umass and you know they re saying some bad things about tannenbaum this week it is what it is i think you just want to play the game on if he has been disrespected by tom brady disrespect \? no brady is a great competitor and if he can stick it to you , he s going to just like we re going to do to him if we get the chance , and anybody else he is a great , fierce competitor the great thing about brady is that he thinks he s going to win every game that sounds really familiar because i know that s how i feel i think we re going to win every game and he feels the same way he gets to go out and prove it on the field i get to watch on who is the better quarterback , peyton manning or tom brady i would like to have either one of them sanchez , i hope can be that kind of quarterback one day you know my thing with one and one a remember how that went over so well when i got here smiling \? that s where i d put them 1 and 1a on which quarterback is 1 and which is 1a i don t have any idea i ll let you figure that one out laughter on if brady points at the opposing team after he scores yes absolutely on if brady pointing is a regular thing i think so because he does it so frequently he s mastered it smiling on if the talk between the jets and the patriots is overrated i have a feeling the motivation for new england to beat us has nothing to do with me just like our motivation to beat new england has nothing to do with anyone there we want to win to advance just like they do after the game they can blow it up to be whatever it is that s the truth that s the reality of it on if brady s fistpump is different than other quarterbacks celebrations i think so he was definitely looking over there for some reason i don t know if he was looking for somebody my job is to keep him from doing that on if brady s fistpumping is a form of taunting yes and it should be penalized on if the patriots will target cromartie i think darrelle revis guaranteed victory this week laughing go ahead and call it , revis laughing that s what i m looking at he did it i heard him say it so go ahead and do it all i did was guarantee a super bowl this year so i wouldn t worry about just one game how about just laying it out there for everybody on his speech quoting hernan cortez i just stole it from somebody i think what i do is go off of the little knowledge i do have that i ve gained through history classes you pick up things along the way during your career i thought that was the appropriate message at that time on if there comes a point where he thinks the team talks too much no everything i ve ever said is because i have a strong belief in our football team i ve gone into every game in my life thinking i m going to win and we re going to win i have belief in myself i ve said it before , i believe in myself , but more importantly , i believe in the players that i coach and i believe in the assistants that coach with me and this organization if i m saying something , i m just stating a fact i believe our football team will win it doesn t matter if it s last week , this week or any week from here on out that s just the way i feel i ve never ripped an opponent , at least publicly they can be great if somebody beats us , they have to be unbelievable they have to be one heck of a football team and that s how i feel on patriots cb devin mccourty i don t know if you necessarily want to pick on that rookie from rutgers , mccourty how many picks does he have \? is he going to need to intercept 20 balls before people stop throwing it at him \? i don t know he s done a great job he makes big plays the thing that s the most impressive stat about the patriots is the plus28 turnover ratio that s an incredible stat i think it s the secondbest in nfl history or close to it their formula is simple they get ahead of you , you have to try to catch up , and when you do , you make mistakes that s why the yardage is a little misleading when you look at their defense their defense is 25th in the league , but it s much better than that they force turnovers the other thing is their nine scores on returns , the five by their defense , the two kick returns , a punt return , a blocked punt for a touchdown those are impressive numbers that maybe aren t in the regular numbers but that you certainly notice going against them on if he has ever worked for an organization that has asked him to tone his personality down probably everybody i have ever played for or coached , but nobody asked me before when i was a defensive coordinator i would say the same things , but instead of having this many reporters , there may have been one or two that s about it now it s just a bigger stage , but i was still the same person then as i am now on having a week for the safeties to practice it certainly helps that you have had longer to prepare for them we will see if it makes that big of a difference i certainly hope it does on how it felt to lose jim leonhard before the last game against the patriots it was tough , there s no question he was basically the quarterback of our defense the one thing that it did was it made brodney pool learn the defense instead of just relying on that one guy brodney has played exceptionally well since that injury sometime you lean so much on a guy because he knows the system and you wait for him to tell you what to do now brodney is like , well , i have to learn it brodney has done an outstanding job for us as of late on pool going 1on1 with top receivers anytime you have a safety covering a wideout or a receiving tight end , i don t know if comfortable is the right word but he certainly can do the job he s as athletic as any of the safeties out there on if sanchez s preparation for sunday is different than the preparation for the last game against the patriots we have moved past that game , but we are certainly going to look at it and learn from it i think the big thing is saying how poorly he played fell right into line when you re down 100 points , you re going to make mistakes that probably had more to do with it than anything else on if he spoke to cromartie about his comments towards brady no i did say that they now have someone they dislike more than me laughter i felt pretty good on if brad smith will play on sunday we expect brad to play if he doesn t play , you re obviously not going to have the wildcat like you would if he was in there he s such a threat back there in that role because he can throw it and he can run it he has great ballhandling and can throw the option pass and shovel pass i certainly hope he can play on if cromartie will be used for kickoff returns even if smith is available no if brad can go , he led the league in kickoff returns , i would keep brad in that role if he s 100 percent on if the players need to win their 1on1 matchups to beat brady that s part of it if you put us in that situation , he gets rid of the ball so fast that you re not going to get sacks it s as simple as that you re not going to sack him you want to disrupt him you want to disrupt the timing of it where he s not comfortable you want to get hits on him the thing about brady is he ll stand in there until the last second and he ll throw the ball , where some guys are rhythm quarterbacks one , two , boom , shoot it out he ll wait and he ll take the hit he s not going to try to knock you over like ben roethlisberger does and just come by and smack the guy you can get more hits on brady the longer he has to throw , that s tough we have to do a great job finishing our rushes without question and hopefully not let him have that kind of timing the guy was as hot as i ve ever seen him and unfortunately we were on the receiving end of it on how concerned he is about brandon moore s injury i think brandon will be fine he kind of tweaked his back in the weightroom everybody s going , oh , there s another weightroom injury he was just do some exercise for his back and he tweaked it
washington the adult sons of have lashed out at president obama in their first public reaction to their father s death , accusing the united states of violating its basic legal principles by killing an unarmed man , shooting his family members and disposing of his body in the sea the statement , provided to the new york times on tuesday , said the family was asking why bin laden , the leader of al qaeda , was not arrested and tried in a court of law so that truth is revealed to the people of the world citing the trials of saddam hussein , the former iraqi leader , and slobodan milosevic , the former serbian leader , the statement questioned the propriety of such assassination where not only international law has been blatantly violated , but the principles of presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial were ignored we maintain that arbitrary killing is not a solution to political problems , the statement said , adding that justice must be seen to be done the statement , prepared at the direction of omar bin laden , who had publicly denounced his father s terrorism , was provided to the times by jean sasson , an american author who helped the younger mr bin laden write a 2009 memoir , growing up bin laden a shorter , slightly different statement was posted on jihadist web sites omar bin laden , 30 , lived with his father in afghanistan until 1999 , when he left with his mother , najwa bin laden , who cowrote the memoir in the book and other public statements , the younger mr bin laden had denounced violence of all kinds , a stance he repeated in the sons' statement we want to remind the world that omar bin laden , the fourthborn son of our father , always disagreed with our father regarding any violence and always sent messages to our father , that he must change his ways and that no civilians should be attacked under any circumstances , the statement said despite the difficulty of publicly disagreeing with our father , he never hesitated to condemn any violent attacks made by anyone , and expressed sorrow for the victims of any and all attacks condemning the shooting of one of the qaeda leader s wives during the assault on may 2 in abbottabad , pakistan , the statement added , as he condemned our father , we now condemn the president of the united states for ordering the execution of unarmed men and women in explaining the killing of bin laden , obama administration officials have cited the principle of national selfdefense in international law , noting that bin laden had declared war on the united states , killed thousands of americans and vowed to kill more the sons' statement called on the government of pakistan to hand over to family members the three wives and a number of children now believed to be in pakistani custody and asked for a united nations investigation of the circumstances of their father s death none of osama bin laden s sons other than omar , who lives in saudi arabia and qatar , were named in the statement ms sasson said she believed it was approved by three other adult sons who have not lived with their father for many years before osama bin laden fled afghanistan in 2001 , he had at least 11 sons , one of whom was killed in the assault last week , and nine daughters , by ms sasson s count in addition to the statement , ms sasson shared notes on what omar bin laden , who declined to be interviewed directly , had told her by telephone in recent days the notes describe mr bin laden s struggle , as he came of age , to understand and eventually reject his father s embrace of religious violence mr bin laden told ms sasson that the death of his father has affected this family in much the same way as many other families that experience such a loss but he also described a childhood of upheavals and relocations that , she said , caused his mother and siblings great upset and danger mr bin laden said that by the age of 18 , after al qaeda had plotted the bombings of two american embassies in east africa and two years before the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks , he had concluded that the course of action his father was taking was not for him , irrespective of what his father s wishes were , ms sasson said eventually he asked his father s permission to leave afghanistan with his mother and younger siblings he told ms sasson that he thanks allah that his father granted his permission for this departure , otherwise the grief the family faces could be even greater

on matchday 6 , four teams are playing only for bonus money and four teams are playing for precious spots in the group stage and if it seems that it is always about manchester united and city that is because at least on wednesday it most certainly is the top two clubs in the english premier league standings could conceivably end up as spectators after the group stage or could swan into the knockout stage with a huge sigh of relief united s prospects seem a bit more reasonable it is in with a win or a draw at basel in switzerland city will need to conjure some blue magic , needing a win at home against bayern munich and villarreal to rise from its slumber to beat napoli at the madrigal in spain the telephone and internet betting lines are now open , if you dare here s a preview of wednesday s games \( all matches kick off at 2 45 pm , eastern \) group a bayern munich at manchester city napoli at villarreal group b cska moscow at inter trabzonspor at lille group c otelul galati at benfica manchester united at basel group d real madrid at ajax lyon at dinamo zagreb \( live tv basel at manchester united , fox soccer real madrid at ajax , msg plus bayern munich at manchester city , fox soccer plus \) a brief look at wednesday s games group a bayern munich 13 points , napoli 8 , manchester city 7 , villarreal 0 bayern munich is in the northwest of england basically for a runaround , having already clinched the top spot in the group it is host manchester city that is desperate to win the game and hope that pointless villarreal can give napoli a game in spain possible , but not likely munich will be playing without arjen robben and toni kroos , both of whom have the flu in addition , strikers thomas m ller and mario gomez either have similar symptoms or manager jupp heynckes believes it is not necessary to run out all his stallions for a meaningless trip to manchester tomorrow is a big match between two league leaders , heynckes told reuters obviously it s a matter of prestige , there s also the question of the winning bonus and the uefa rankings so it is an important match for bayern munich tomorrow my team will be performing on the pitch to win sure and bob s your uncle group b inter 10 points , trabzonspor 6 , lille 5 , cska moscow 5 inter is untouchable atop the group but the second slot and a ticket to the next round is up for grabs the result in france could settle matters either way , with the winner of the game between lille and the turkish team trabzonspor advancing to the knockout round a tie would open the door for the russians if they can win at milan the lone point would send trabzonspor through with seven points , tied for the lowest qualifying total since the advent of three points for wins group c benfica 9 points , manchester united 9 , basel 8 , otelul galati 0 a superior headtohead record against united and basel assures benfica of advancing regardless of the result against the winless romanians a benfica wins locks down the top spot in the group united , however , has been in wretched form in both the champions league and the premier league of late in switzerland , basel needs a win to send united packing in the group stage for the first time since 20056 a win by either united or basel and a loss by benfica would give the winner first place group d real madrid 15 points , ajax 8 , lyon 5 , dinamo zagreb 0 no one , not even jos mourinho \( maybe \) , would blame real madrid s players for looking past the match against ajax and to saturday s topofthestandings la liga clash with visiting barcelona on saturday \( live on goltv at 4 pm , eastern and espn3com in the united states \) but the special one is truly into perfection and a win at the amsterdam arena will make the whites a perfect 6 of 6 in the group stage with a tidy 18 points \( that would make madrid only the fifth team to make that claim but uefa said that none of the previous four have won the title \) in the race for no 2 , ajax has a threepoint advantage , the edge on goal difference and has drawn both games against lyon the french club must win , ajax much lose and lyon must score big in croatia
wardsboro , vt scattered around the smooth gray boulders of a burbling brook here , jagged shards of black asphalt the double yellow lines still visible in places are all that remain of a stretch of route 100 that ran along the foothills of the green mountains down the road , floodwaters ate away everything but a precarious sliver of the right lane , which teeters at the edge of a newly carved precipice like a donkey path on the rim of a canyon a collapsed bridge in the nearby town of jamaica looks like a beaver dam , buried under the fallen trees and branches that flowed down the ball mountain brook and knocked the bridge down of all the challenges facing vermont as it tries to recover from the floods caused by the remnants of , there may be none more daunting or vital to solve than repairing and reopening the hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges that the storm knocked out in many spots , the roads must be fixed before equipment can be brought in to repair everything from homes and businesses to the power grid , railroad tracks and water and wastewater systems it is a race against time winter comes early here , and there are just two and a half months before snowfall and frozen ground typically halt the state s short roadbuilding season i think for a lot of us this is going to be the challenge of a lifetime , said joseph flynn , an official at the vermont agency of transportation who is in charge of one of the new quasimilitary incidentcommand centers that the state set up to coordinate the mammoth task several hundred national guard troops have added muscle , running huge olive drab bulldozers and backhoes alongside the yellow equipment of state workers and contractors the topography in this mountainous state where , for centuries , the easiest way to run roads through the mountains has been to locate them along the edges of the rivers and brooks that had already found a path through left many roads vulnerable to flooding , and tough to fix we have areas where we have a mile or more of road that has disappeared into the water , mr flynn said and the upside of the road is all hill so now you come from a forested hill to bare earth to the rivers this is thousands of yards long , where you go from the hillside to where the road used to be right to the river the repair work can be dangerous two contractors shoring up a bridge in clarendon found themselves cut off by a flash flood on thursday , and had to be rescued by helicopter in some places , stranded residents have taken matters into their own hands when a bridge was shut down in royalton , isolating many residents , local fire and rescue workers cleared a path through a sunflower field at the hidden meadow farm uprooting a tree that stood in the way , they cut a hole in a chainlink fence to allow residents to temporarily drive their cars right onto interstate 89 on what may be the shortest onramp in the country they 're calling it the hillbilly highway , said rachel bigelow , who set up a little farm stand selling sunflowers , tomatoes and corn by the juryrigged interstate entrance that now cuts through her farm evelyn saenz , a royalton resident who drove through it on thursday , praised it as vermont ingenuity and had another name for it exit 2 1 2 faced with so much devastation , state officials are taking a triage approach the first order of business was restoring access to 13 towns that were isolated when the roads and bridges were washed out they did this by building what state officials call goat paths , pouring gravel and sand and storm debris onto washedout roads , and flattening them until they were strong enough for emergency vehicles to get over them wardsboro was the last town to be reconnected , when the final link was finished wednesday i 've been trapped for days , said norman bills , 42 , a rural mail carrier , as he stood at the ruins of his home on wardsboro brook we could go a half a mile that way and a half a mile this way now , hopefully tomorrow , i can get out of here and go back and try to do some work just this summer , mr bills said , the brook was such a weak trickle that his children could hardly find a place in it to swim but on sunday it burst its banks and tore off the garage and dining room of his family s home , which once belonged to his greatgrandfather , washing away a venerable apple tree and sending his woodburning stove downstream into a neighbor s lawn i do n't picture that there s any coming back here , unfortunately , as beautiful a spot as it was and as enjoyable as it was to be on the river , he said it s done but we 're all safe , and that s all i care about now state officials are turning to other priorities strengthening roads so they can handle repair trucks and easing the you ca n't get there from here woes that the state charted on of road closings , especially the blocked eastwest routes in southern vermont trucks need to be able to restock the stores and gas stations that residents rely on and with the state s biggest tourism seasons approaching fall foliage and winter skiing there is plenty of work to do to get the roads ready for the tourists from away brian searles , the state s transportation secretary , said that nearly half the closed state roads had already been reopened at least partly we will not be overwhelmed by this , he said we will conquer the obstacles that exist at the command center in dummerston , mr flynn tried to bolster his troops at a morning staff meeting by quoting when he returned to his native vermont as president to help the state recover from the floods of 1927 i love vermont because of her hills and valleys , her scenery and invigorating climate , mr coolidge said then , but most of all because of her indomitable people mr flynn said later while holding a printout of an email of the speech this may be corny , but it is something that was sent to me last night it s always been my favorite quote of calvin coolidge , but i never knew it was attributed to the flood of 1927 i think it says it all right there
andy benoit is previewing all 32 nfl teams a preview of the patriots on tuesday will complete the afc east if only rex ryan would guarantee afc championship game appearances , he d be america s most decorated clairvoyant but he isn t in it for red and white ribbons banking on the adage third time s a charm , the jets enter the 2011 season with essentially the same components they ve had the past two years a case could be made , however , that this past offseason diminished the jets much the way a windstorm diminishes a pile of sand gone from the offense are the veteran right tackle damien woody , fullback tony richardson , wideouts braylon edwards and jerricho cotchery and , most damagingly , the jackofalltrades brad smith the adequacy of these players replacements is up for debate the roles of woody and richardson were filled from within , with wayne hunter now starting at right tackle and the hard knocks star john conner at fullback in these moves , the jets gain youth but lose depth at receiver , derrick mason is a step up from cotchery but unless we re to deliriously believe that three years away from football and 20 months behind bars leaves no rust on a 34yearold , it s hard not to see plaxico burress as a downgrade from braylon edwards as for replacing smith , the jets are hoping to catch a little lightning with the fifthround rookie jeremy kerley  the small changes are even more precarious defensively end shaun ellis is gone , replaced by gifted but raw firstround rookie muhammad wilkerson what was already a very average passrushing unit has lost the top backup jason taylor and replaced him with , well , no one whose name we d recognize the secondary lost a coaches favorite , drew coleman , and replaced him with journeyman donald strickland at least antonio cromartie was resigned though it will be around halloween before jets fans can look at him and not privately long for nnamdi asomugha but perhaps we re nitpicking after all , every team goes through these sorts of changes and not every team gets to ride such a successful defensive system while doing so \( more on that later \) and certainly not every team has a 24yearold quarterback with significant postseason experience and a zip code s worth of room to still grow having your super bowl hopes essentially hinge on your firstround quarterback \? most teams would take that offense mark sanchez is fortunate to play in an offense that has a stellar line and can run the ball , and to play for a coaching staff that understands how to aid his development by manufacturing easy successes for him offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer does a marvelous job with runpass mixture in play calls and with designed quick throws that make sanchez comfortable and take advantage of his greatest strength \( accuracy between the numbers \) over all , it has been a successful first two years for the fifth pick in the 09 draft if that success is to continue , sanchez must make a big leap he s still not a natural progression passer his pocket mobility remains poor athletically , he is good at buying time under pressure , but there s a difference between buying time and buying time to throw elite quarterbacks buy time by sliding and stepping up in the pocket , all the while maintaining their readiness to fire in a split second in other words , elite quarterbacks buy time to throw sanchez , like most young quarterbacks , buys time by looking at the passrushers , tucking the ball and eluding them by doing this , he s not a threat to throw a quarterback who s not a threat to throw is not much of a threat at all sanchez must correct this if he s ever to become a consistent progression passer because he s so good when it comes to quickplantandthrow , and because he has just soso arm strength , the jets passing attack will always revolve predominantly around underneath routes but a progression passer at least presents the vital option of going over the top a big part of the fieldstretching onus falls on the receiving corps , of course the significance of santonio holmes s return is clear holmes has terrific speed , but what puts him in the nfl s top echelon of wideouts is the way he disguises routes there s no one better derrick mason , however , is close there s still plenty of juice in his 37yearold legs with mason , the jets can mix formations , as he s adept both inside and out the rest of the receiving group is tenuous it s possible plaxico burress can be the standout target he was for the giants , but it s certainly not probable burress wasn t able to get on the field early in training camp \( ankle \) if serviceability is an issue , the jets will find themselves handing out biggerthanexpected roles to rookie jeremy kerley or dolphins failure patrick turner  on the bright side , this would present an opportunity for tight end dustin keller to become a more integral part of the passing game oddly enough , most of keller s teamleading 55 catches last season were a consequence of play design rather than his commanding the ball as a mismatch creator this isn t to say keller , who has a great rapport with sanchez , doesn t have the fluidity to create mismatches he s a flexible athlete one problem , though , is that even in threereceiver sets , the jets occasionally feel compelled to replace keller with blocking tight end matthew mulligan , which speaks volumes about what little regard they have for keller s blocking at least the rest of new york s blocking is formidable the cohesion and talent of the front five has led the way to a topfour ground game each of the past two seasons it starts with the best center in football , nick mangold besides consistently getting to the second level as a runblocker , mangold s primary value is that he can battle any afc nose tackle to a stalemate oneonone this is a big plus considering 11 of the jets 2011 opponents predominantly use a 34 scheme that centers on a nose tackle being able to occupy two blockers in these instances , left guard matt slauson or right guard brandon moore become something of a bonus contributor up front slauson is no alan faneca , although he showed encouraging improvement in his runblocking mobility last season at this point , last year s secondround pick , vladimir ducasse , doesn t appear close to starting at left guard moore , a ninthyear vet , has been perhaps the jets steadiest lineman the past five years like a good chain restaurant , he does nothing great but everything well d brickashaw ferguson , while not stout in close quarters , brings great feet to the left tackle position on the right side , there should be concerns about new starter wayne hunter though described by highly respected offensive line coach bill callahan as the team s most athletic lineman \( ferguson might take issue with that \) , hunter was a noticeable downgrade replacing the injured damien woody last season before that , he was the extra blocker in the team s frequent sixoffensive linemen packages that role will now be filled by the less reliable ducasse or less nimble robert turner  running behind the meaty front will be shonn greene , who , like sanchez , must make a leap in progress in his third season ladainian tomlinson still has the lateral agility , receiving dexterity and , obviously , wisdom , to be a productive thirddown back , but the jets are depending on greene to be their battering ram the jets also must account for the 299 rushing yards brad smith sparked in this offense last season smith s role as the wildcat specialist was no gimmick it was the jets only source of true speed the hope is that joe mcknight can suddenly mature and assume the duties if he can t , kerley will get a shot , although given the complexity of the responsibilities \( debating and disguising between running and throwing , all while setting up blocks \) , the jets will probably hand it over to the slower ladainian tomlinson and insist that it s not a downgrade defense one of the biggest misconceptions in football is that rex ryan s defense is a \) super blitzheavy and b \) super complex in actuality , ryan s defense is more deceiving and versatile it s important to understand the difference , especially given that so many other teams are trying to mimic what the jets do ryan s philosophy centers on the concept of winning early in the down the earlier in the down you can disrupt the offense , the more likely it is you ll win the play the easiest way to win early in the down is to confuse your opponent from the getgo and the easiest way to do this is to show him one thing and then do another the jets do this as well as any team in the league ryan and the defensive coordinator mike pettine have a great feel for zone exchange concepts a zone exchange is , in simplest terms , when a defense shows blitz but winds up only rushing four its goal is to make an offense waste extra blockers unnecessarily and instill panic in a quarterback who s now thinking blitz but is actually throwing against a sevendefender coverage another reason the jets create great presnap confusion is they ve mastered a tactic that insiders call cross training , which is using multiple players to fulfill one task believe it or not , the jets don t have a ton of blitzes in their playbook but what they have are multiple players who can execute the same blitz so , for example , the same blitz that features calvin pace in the second quarter might show up again in the third and fourth quarter , only in pace s place is , say , bart scott or jim leonhard this mixture of personnel can confuse the life out of an offense so really , the key to the jet defense is versatile personnel oh , and darrelle revis versatile personnel and a shutdown corner who can eliminate an entire side of the field without any safety help those are the keys to having a great defense new york s most versatile players are safeties jim leonhard , brodney pool and eric smith none are stars \( though leonhard can be an estimable playmaker at times \) but all can patrol centerfield or be attackers in the box they re often critical to many of ryan s presnap disguises the only jet defender besides revis who is used in the same manner virtually every play is antonio cromartie he s a cover artist in the rawest form , overflowing with athleticism and , to the chagrin of the jet coaching staff , sorely lacking in physicality and fundamentals rounding out the secondary , the jets are nervously relying on last year s firstround pick , kyle wilson , to fill the allimportant nickel spot that drew coleman \( now a jaguar \) filled so astutely if wilson can t quickly discover his confidence , the jets will have to call on donald strickland or marquice cole  up front , this team has an approach to stopping the run that few , if any , nfl defenses share rather than concern themselves with controlling gaps , jet defensive linemen are instructed to manhandle the blocker in front of them the idea is to physically win at the line of scrimmage and allow the linebackers to read the action and attack the ball accordingly this only works if you have smart , lively inside linebackers \( which the jets have in david harris and bart scott \) the emphasis on physical domination is why mike tannenbaum invested a firstround pick in end muhammad wilkerson the 305pounder needs work in his mechanics , but with massive ropati pitoitua being the only end besides the feloniously underrated mike devito with any experience , the jets have no choice but to play the rookie right away their other rookie , thirdrounder kenrick ellis , will at least get a chance to learn off the bench behind sione pouha , a hardworking nose tackle who can push a pile and also chase the ball at outside linebacker , there are no bona fide stars , though calvin pace is a superb rundefender and adequate passrusher who can do whatever s asked of him bryan thomas is the same way , only in less dynamic fashion linebacking depth is a major concern across the board the jets do not have a single backup inside or outside who was even drafted however , one of those undrafted guys , jamaal westerman , has drawn rave reviews in camp special teams nick folk has a big foot but tends to go through hot and cold spells and now has to keep his kicking job from nick novak unknowns tj conley and chris bryan are competing to replace punter steve weatherford jeremy kerley will get a crack at returning punts and kicks , with kyle wilson the likely fallback option bottom line depth is a major concern , especially on defense there are a lot of young players being counted on to fill the shoes of underrated departed veterans this is unsettling given the shortened offseason with these details perhaps no longer on the jets side , the team s fate is tied even tighter to the development of its young quarterback predicted finish 2nd

washington , aug 3 , 1861 his irritation was growing by the minute prince napoleon joseph charles paul bonaparte son and grandson of kings , nephew and cousin of emperors , bearer of the century s most famous name had come to call on the ruler of the american republic , to bestow his imperial favor upon the beleaguered president at a moment when the president needed all the favors he could get but now it seemed that no one was home the prince and his companions \( various counts , barons , and lesser lackeys \) had been impressed enough by their first glimpse of the white house a rather nice palace , one of them noted on ascending the grand steps , however , they found no valet or butler to greet them not even a doorman of the sort to be found at any decent american hotel finally , after being admitted unceremoniously by a passing clerk , they were left standing in the vestibule , wondering when or if president lincoln might deign to emerge and greet them true , his highness visit was , at least officially speaking , unofficial he had crossed the atlantic not as an emissary from his cousin emperor napoleon iii of france , but as a private gentleman , a career military officer curious to witness firsthand the emerging conflict in america he had stepped onto the wharf in new york a week earlier dressed not in ermines or epaulettes , but like an ordinary tourist , in a white linen suit and straw hat yet most americans , and more than a few frenchmen , suspected that he was just playacting for discretion s sake prince napoleon was known to be especially close to the emperor , especially as an adviser on foreign relations and military affairs with both north and south holding their breath to see whether the european powers would publicly favor union or confederacy and with napoleon iii known to harbor private sympathies for the rebels the slightest bow or nod from this imperial traveler might be momentous any report he brought back to paris might tip the balance of french policy , and thus even of american history all this made it thoroughly bizarre that it took more than 15 minutes before lincoln , preceded by secretary of state william h seward , finally came ambling into the reception room that morning the infuriated prince , one of the frenchmen wrote later , had been on the verge of turning on his heel and departing nor did the visitors first impressions of the president leave them much better disposed this homely man seemed graced with none of the rustic frontier charm they had hoped for , the sort that had so endeared monsieur franklin to his parisian hosts almost a century earlier lincoln , the dapper frenchmen noted with disdain , stood awkwardly holding a pair of white gloves that were clearly much too small for his large , hairy hands , while the cut of his beard would make jupiter himself look vulgar after shaking hands with the visitors , the president , who spoke no french , seemed at a total loss for words , even english ones mr lincoln gained a few more minutes by asking the prince to sit down and by sitting himself , the whole affair being done amidst a great movement of chairs , wrote one of the french aides , camille auguste anatole ferripisani but , once these new positions were acquired , the two parties sat opposite each other silently , without troubling to go any further mr lincoln was visibly uncomfortable the prince , unhappy because he had been made to wait , took a cruel pleasure in remaining silent then lincoln came up with a way to break the ice he asked kindly after the health of his guest s father , lucien bonaparte unfortunately , the president s handlers had not briefed him well lucien was actually prince napoleon s uncle and , worse , had been dead for more than 20 years swiftly corrected by the frenchmen , lincoln fumbled for more pleasantries had they had a pleasant journey \? wasn t the weather hot today \? napoleon , in heavily accented english , replied monosyllabically at last , mercifully , the president began shaking everyone s hands again , allowing them to depart perhaps lincoln s anxiety grew out of some degree of awe emperor napoleon i the most famous of the bonapartes , and the prince s uncle towered over 19thcentury history like a colossus , especially in the minds of americans , who regarded him with a strange mixture of abhorrence and admiration indeed , lincoln had spoken of napoleon in his very first significant public address , when he himself was just a 28yearold illinoisan with vague ambitions of greatness towering genius distains a beaten path , he had told an audience of young men at the springfield , ill , lyceum , ranking bonaparte \( then dead just 17 years \) alongside julius caesar and alexander the great such men had won eternal fame , but they had also turned the free societies of greece , rome and france into autocracies yet for millions of ambitious young americans as lincoln himself had been then the obscure corsican artilleryman turned emperor remained a role model ralph waldo emerson hailed napoleon as the hero of young , ardent and active men , everywhere , who had nobly transformed old , ironbound feudal france into a young ohio or new york later that day lincoln had a second chance to try to impress the corsican artilleryman s nephew , when he hosted prince napoleon and his suite in a state dinner at the white house mary todd lincoln who adored french fashions and even prided herself on speaking a few words of the language , albeit in an atrocious kentucky accent pulled out all the stops to woo her imperial guest she personally chose the menu , the flowers and even the vegetables from the white house garden , all with an eye toward enchanting the parisian sophisticates yet if there were any french term that seemed to summarize the occasion , it would seem to have been faux pas upon prince napoleon s arrival , the marine band jauntily struck up the marseillaise hardly appropriate for a man whose family had ruthlessly quashed the forces of republican revolution at the dinner table , the massive gen winfield scott made a favorable impression on the guests he had , after all , fought valiantly against the hated english in the war of 1812 except when he began clumsily dropping hints that they might compare his own career to napoleon s \( meanwhile , gen george mcclellan , himself a young napoleon already scheming to replace scott , sat nearby courting the french officers by lavishing praise on their army , and blushing discreetly when someone suggested that he might be next in line for the presidency \) nevertheless , at the end of the evening , all seemed to have gone well prince napoleon , apparently mollified if not enchanted , made gracious farewells mrs lincoln s cousin elizabeth grimsley , who was present , gushed that it had been a beautiful dinner beautifully served , with gay conversation in which the french tongue predominated similarly sycophantic newspaper editors compared the first lady favorably to queen victoria and empress eugenie , noting that her elegant but unassuming manners made republican simplicity seem almost regal half a century later , prince napoleon s actual feelings were revealed when a french magazine published excerpts from his private diary mrs lincoln , the guest of honor had recorded after the white house dinner , was dressed in the french mode without any taste she has the manner of a petit bourgeois and wears tin jewelry her lovingly prepared meal was a bad dinner in the french style as for the president himself , the prince described him as badly put together , in a black suit , with the appearance of a bootmaker \( in fairness , it must be noted that the middleaged prince himself was pudgy , dumpy and dour \) napoleon continued ruefully what a difference between this sad representative of the great republic and her founding fathers ! lincoln , he concluded , was a good man , but one without greatness nor very much knowledge luckily , these thoughts were not yet public when , several days after the state dinner , prince napoleon and his suite took their leave of washington and promptly turned up across confederate lines in virginia , paying an equally cordial visit to the headquarters of the rebel gen gt beauregard \( the louisianan s admirers had long since nicknamed him little napoleon \) the frenchmen toured the scene of the confederates recent victory at manassas , observing fresh graves and still unburied corpses on the battlefield they poured praise over beauregard face , physiognomy language and accent , everything about him denotes his french origin , ferripisani wrote he is very brave everything in him points to a remarkable military aptitude , if not to superior intelligence they likewise lauded the confederate cavalrymen their beautiful male virginian faces , their magnificent mounts and the boldness of their riding technique make it impossible not to admire these ragged riders back in washington , mary todd lincoln was taken aback when , several weeks after the state banquet for prince napoleon , the caterers bill arrived the sum was extravagant , far beyond the lincolns means with a bit of creative bookkeeping and , perhaps , a sardonic sense of humor about the true nature of diplomatic entertaining mrs lincoln charged the

played on the bucknell basketball team , graduating last year as i finished up a sunday night workout at the local recreation center in leesburg , va , my priority was to check the scores but first i came across a text message from one of my best friends , nick petkovich , who spent many a day working out at that same gym , lifting weights and taking part in oneonone battles his message read , we going to the shipppp boiii ! ! ! nick is a junior guard for lafayette college , and just finished playing in what he calls the craziest game i ve played in , the kind of game that puts the madness in march lafayette beat american , 7371 , in a doubleovertime thriller on a lastsecond jim mower 3pointer , earning a trip to lewisburg , pa , where it will face bucknell in the patriot league championship game friday night after watching the highlights , i understood nick s description of the game and texted him back wow , i didn t know it was like that he replied , oh ya , it was like that i m happy for nick , but i am also thrilled for my former teammates and coaches at bucknell , none more so than my freshman roommate stephen tyree tyree entered and graduated college the same time as i did , but a redshirt junior season has kept him around for an extra year that redshirt was granted after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and a calf muscle in a pickup game in the fall of 2008 he had surgery , went through months of rehab , and returned to the court last season , averaging over 26 minutes a game , but he was never quite at full strength just before the start of this season , tyree tore his anterior cruciate ligament again , this time in practice he quickly rejected the thought of another surgery in hopes he could return to the court before season s end i really didn t want to come back for another year , he said then i d have to get my license plates changed and just become a townie when word got out that he was going to try to play , many thought there was no way they were wrong just two months after his second torn acl , he returned to the hardwood against cornell on dec 20 his playing time has been limited he often does not get in the game but do not think for a second he is not the leader of the team when asked about the team s success after a 26 start , tyree said , we really came together and embraced being a great defensive team , and it started in practice tyree knows a thing or two about defense he was named patriot league defensive player of the year as a sophomore tyree and the bison are one game away from returning to the ncaa tournament , where they won firstround games over kansas and arkansas in 2005 and 2006 if the bison can return , those filling out their bracket will probably think about them as a potential upset pick not only did they dominate the patriot league regular season with a 131 record , but they re the school that beat kansas , right \? at least that s what people usually say to me when i tell them i graduated from there less than a year removed from my days in central pennsylvania , i am very aware what the campus is like right now it s filled with excitement and anticipation it s unlike any other time of the year , tyree said everyone is coming up to us wanting to talk basketball , and wishing us luck with a friday night win , that anticipation will quickly turn into mayhem especially at the bull run inn , the primary bar in the small downtown section of campus despite friday s being the final day of classes before spring break , i have a hunch just about everyone will be hanging around for the 4 45 pm tipoff \( espn2 \) and if such mayhem does go down , let s just hope everyone waits until saturday morning to venture home

the decisive referendum vote to repeal the bill that would limit collective bargaining by public sector unions has changed the political landscape in ohio tuesday s vote on senate bill 5 could and should be a harbinger for the 2012 presidential election by mounting a direct assault on public sector workers and the unions who represent them , gov john r kasich of ohio may have done more to help barack obama win reelection than anything obama s political team is likely to do over the next 12 months with ohio s continuing high unemployment rate \( 91 ! , just like the rest of the us \) , it had seemed unlikely that president obama could win ohio , and without ohio , he d have difficulty getting reelected the same factors make reelection a challenge for senator sherrod brown , an ohio democratic and one of the most prolabor members of the senate but kasich , the republicans in the ohio legislature and outside conservative financers and think tanks like the buckeye institute , may have done obama and brown a big favor karl rove described senate bill 5 as a much more extensive reform to public sector unions than was enacted in wisconsin , in part because the ohio version included firefighters and police officers while the protests in columbus were smaller and received less national attention than those in madison , unions and community groups in ohio organized a ballot initiative with 10 , 000 volunteers circulating petitions in all 88 counties over 13 million ohioans more than five times the number required to put the initiative on the ballot signed the petitions despite a large influx of money from conservative organizations like citizens united , freedom works , and restoring america , ohio voters repealed senate bill 5 by an overwhelming 22 point margin 39 yes , 61 no \( a no vote was prounion \) democrats and independents voted overwhelmingly against the measure , and , if preelection polls are correct , 30 of ohio republicans also voted to reject senate bill 5 this should be good news for obama while ohio is notorious for swinging back and forth between supporting republicans and democrats , its 18 electoral votes are especially important for republican candidates it s almost impossible for a republican to win the presidential election without ohio , and that means winning significant support among union household voters according to cnn exit polls from the last few elections , union household voters remain a strong presence in ohio , even after more than three decades of deindustrialization twentyeight percent of ohio voters come from union households , compared with 23 percent nationally in 2008 , they underperformed for obama , who won 56 percent of their votes in ohio versus 59 percent from union households across the country no similar data exists for the 2010 midterm election , but many labor leaders admit that kasich beat the democratic governor , ted strickland , in part because voters from community groups and union households either voted republican or stayed home \( essentially giving half a vote to kasich \) if union households in ohio lost their enthusiasm for democratic candidates in recent years , kasich s actions , together with the national republicans justsayno politics and killmedicare initiatives \( like the paul ryan budget \) , have made the democrats look a lot better than they did in 2010 it all comes down to math in 2008 , 2 , 933 , 388 ohioans voted \( or 515 \) for obama , 258 , 897 more than mccain won if union households maintain their proportion of the electorate , and if just 1 percent more of them vote for democrats , they can add 15 , 700 votes to the democratic vote and subtract the same number from the republicans a swing of more than 31 , 000 votes if ohio s union household voters increase their support for democrats by 3 percent that is , if they match the national average for union household voters they would generate 47 , 100 additional votes for obama , a swing of 94 , 200 votes that alone could give the president ohio s electoral votes but because of senate bill 5 , we might reasonably expect an even larger shift a recent quinnipiac poll suggests that the anger generated by the antiunion bill and the organizing fostered by the effort to overturn it has 70 percent of union household voters planning to support obama and the democrats in 2012 that translates into an increase of 219 , 829 votes for obama , a swing of almost 440 , 000 votes put differently , a mobilized ohio labor movement with 742 , 000 members , including many teachers , police officers , and firefighters who have often voted republican , will be more likely to vote for democrats in 2012 this gives obama the opportunity to score a big victory in ohio , but that won t happen solely on the basis of senate bill 5 the president must offer a positive economic vision and a program for economic change the american jobs act even if it must be pushed through piecemeal is a good start , as are the president s recent actions on mortgages and student loans such positions will also help senator brown s chances of reelection , but in 2012 , in ohio at least , the usual pattern of members of congress benefiting from presidential coattails could be reversed brown s solid support for organized labor , community groups and those who have been most hurt by the continuing economic crisis positions that resonate with the millions of ohio voters who overturned senate bill 5 may help obama more than anything obama has done will help brown none of this is guaranteed , of course in order for the battle over senate bill 5 to influence the 2012 election , those who have organized so effectively to defend unions must continue to work together unions will have to keep educating members and reach out to those outside of the labor movement they will also have to work closely with community and neighborhood groups like the ohio organizing collaborative , which played a pivotal role in community organizing around senate bill 5 none of that will be easy competing interests within and between organized labor and community organizations make the coalition very fragile the aflcio is relatively weak in ohio , and some tensions exist between public and private sector unions meanwhile , ohio republicans are threatening to put parts of senate bill 5 through in a series of smaller bills next year without solidarity across labor organizations , the coalition that fought so well against one big bill could fracture it may be that other issues won t have the unifying effect of senate bill 5 after all , the same voters who overturned that bill approved a constitutional amendment barring the implementation of the individual insurance mandate of the patient protection and affordable health care act but if the organizers of the campaign against senate bill 5 can hold together and if the obama campaign can tap into the anger and solidarity of that fight , tuesday s vote could turn out to be the turning point in the 2012 election john russo is a professor of labor studies and codirector of the center for workingclass studies at youngstown state university
vancouver , british columbia in one of the worst episodes of rioting canada has seen in decades , hockey fans angry over losing the stanley cup clashed with police officers , set vehicles ablaze , smashed windows and looted and burned stores throughout the downtown area here on wednesday night the vancouver coastal health authority said that one person was in critical condition and that up to 139 others were treated at two downtown hospitals many had suffered tear gas exposure , the authority said , but there were at least eight stabbings , some cases of major trauma , and head injuries , fractures and cuts the riots stunned the police , the city and the nation , all of which had recalled rioting after the ' defeat in the 1994 finals to the new york rangers the provincial government had ordered all liquor stores downtown closed in the afternoon before the last two games the police had put a 13 million security plan in place , and issued repeated assurances that there would be no repeat but thursday night , with the last game of the stanley cup finals drawing to a close and the home team trailing 40 , some of the estimated 100 , 000 fans watching the game on giant televisions in free public viewing areas downtown began a fourhour rampage , leaving a trail of destruction , looting and violence that far outstripped the melees of 17 years ago vancouver s mayor , gregor robertson , blamed a small group of people intent on breaking the law and smearing the reputation of the city , but images from the riot show that many of the people looting , destroying property and fighting were wearing hockey jerseys and did not cover their faces to avoid identification the police and mr robertson said that video images and photos would be used to track down and punish rioters it s absolutely disgraceful and shameful and by no means represents the city of vancouver , the mayor said we 've had a great run in the playoffs here , great celebrations , and what s happened tonight is despicable one amateur video sent to the canadian broadcasting corporation showed a man trying to stop rioters from breaking into a department store he was swiftly thrown to the ground by a crowd and kicked and beaten the extent of the man s injuries are unknown alyssa polinsky , a spokeswoman for vancouver coastal health , said that st paul s hospital had treated five people with stab wounds and vancouver general hospital had treated three for similar wounds st paul s hospital reported treating about 60 people in its emergency room in a twohour span for pepper spray and tear gas exposure and other injuries dr eric grafstein , head of emergency there , said that those requiring surgery included fractured ankles and legs , a broken jaw and a collapsed lung the police declared some of downtown a riot zone , giving them sweeping powers of arrest , and officers used pepper spray , tear gas and flash bombs to move thousands of people who had ignored directives to leave immediately police units from surrounding municipalities some from as far away as abbotsford , some 40 miles to the southeast were called in as well as members of the royal canadian mounted police inside rogers arena , the mood briefly turned ugly during the postgame trophy presentations , although that anger was aimed mostly at the national hockey league commissioner , gary bettman , a man widely disliked in canada for his perceived indifference to the concerns of the league s canadian teams as mr bettman walked onto the ice on a red carpet to present the conn smythe trophy to the goalie tim thomas and the stanley cup to boston s captain , zdeno chara , the commissioner s voice was drowned out by booing from many of the roughly 10 , 000 fans who remained several drinks were hurled onto the ice near where mr bettman was standing , but none struck him the cbc s television coverage shifted quickly from the bruins' postgame celebrations at the arena to the disturbances outside the cbc showed images of young men leaping on police cruisers , trying to shatter their windshields , and hurling debris at police trucks some police cars were set on fire bonfires were set on street corners as groups of people , many in canucks jerseys , threw temporary fencing at officers in riot gear a mounted police squad tried to regain control among a cluster of federal buildings , while unrest spread to the granville mall nightclub zone and the robson street shopping district not far from the sutton place hotel , the nhl s headquarters during the stanley cup finals , people were seen running with electronics and a reporter was offered a camera , with price tags still on it , for purchase service on the skytrain , the city s subway and elevated train service , was disrupted for hours , and buses and ferry service to downtown was also shut down bridges leading into downtown were closed fires burned while fire crews waited for the police restore order some firefighters trying to fight blazes were attacked and forced to retreat major sportsrelated violence is relatively rare in canada in montreal in 1955 , there were riots after the nhl suspended maurice richard , quebec s greatest hockey hero , after he was involved in a violent confrontation with a member of the boston bruins that city has seen other hockey riots , if on a smaller scale , since then including one in 2008 in contrast , the mood in vancouver for the 2010 winter olympics was peaceful , even though thousands of people were in the streets to celebrate each victory for team canada on its path to the men s hockey gold medal the city earned worldwide praise for its goodnatured hockey fans and for the restraint of its police we were just on the world stage during the olympics , and people were speaking highly of vancouver , said geoff matthews , 34 , who lives downtown it s a great city and country to live in , and to see this , it s heartbreaking

twice annually under their famous neon lights pacquiao is an economic driver for the local economy , his influence as powerful as his left hook on fight weekends , that impact extends from an uptick in gambling to an increase in everything from hotel rates to the price of bottle service at local nightclubs in a city that lacks even one franchise in any of the major professional sports leagues , tourism is driven by events , few bigger than a championship prizefight in fact , a bout like pacquiao s against juan manuel marquez at the mgm grand on saturday will earn the nevada athletic commission its budget for the year and that is but one small slice over lunch tuesday , todd duboef , president of top rank boxing , chewed over a chopped salad and pacquiao s economic boost in a typical fight week asked if that impact reached 100 million , he scoffed no , he said it s way more not 100 million hundreds of millions while promoters are certainly no strangers to hyperbole , duboef ticked off dozens of factors that come into play , all of which center on a single premise more visitors spend more money that makes pacquiao and other famous boxers an economic stimulus plan all because two men stand in a ring and hit each other in the face when , pacquiao s chief rival for the title of best boxer on the planet , gripes about how pacquiao earns his money here yet spends it overseas , mayweather , too , misses the larger point both boxers jolt the economy in the city mayweather calls home it s hard to put a specific number on it , said josh swissman , vice president for corporate marketing at mgm resorts international but it s a marked increase a fight weekend like this is like for us and new year s eve is the biggest night in the whole city duboef grew up here , attending his first championship fight , which featured , when he was a teenager that night , vegas felt like the epicenter of the world , he said he watched the strip change and grow over the years , with its fancy shows and expensive concerts even though the sport diminished in popularity , boxing remained a constant in las vegas , through the high times and the that hit in 2008 no fighter drew crowds , and thus disposable income , the way mike tyson did but the promoters' goal remained the same build a fan base , and they will come , from mexico , or england , or anywhere , really that s why ricky hatton stayed so long in england , said bob arum , chairman of top rank when he came to vegas , he brought an army with him the gaming did n't increase but the beer sales were out of sight over the years , those involved developed a science behind fight week hotels worked with promoters to tie pugilism to other events , like thursday s or major holidays , which is why cinco de mayo is often booked with mexican fighters on the cards for leonard , hearns , tyson and boxers of similar magnitude , vegas became the destination those fighters , in turn , helped sustain the city , saw it boom you can feel the emotion on the eve of a big fight , said oscar goodman , the former mayor it s almost like the days before a  pacquiao , though , is different from the others he was not considered a superstar until november 2009 , when for his seventh title in seven weight classes there were other major fights before that , certainly , but against cotto , pacquiao crossed into the mainstream he brought with him a large and loyal fan base , which included highend asian gamblers in recent years , las vegas s primary , narrow recovery resulted almost exclusively from the baccarat boom , according to michael lawton , a senior research analyst for the nevada gaming control board , and those types of high rollers appear drawn to championship fights duboef said top rank saw this coming when it signed pacquiao it had planned to capitalize on the asian market , with an asian superstar , and to do so in macau , china s replica of las vegas we thought macau was the promised land , duboef said it turned out manny translated here , for the same reasons , instead estimates place the number of filipinos and filipinoamericans who work and live in greater las vegas at more 65 , 000 they , too , see increased business when pacquiao comes to town at his grand arrival tuesday , the stood next to the makeshift ring inside the mgm lobby , the dancers' eyes filled with pride beyond that , pacquiao , a congressman in the philippines , draws international , often political , coverage unlike any boxer before , having graced the covers of time and newsweek while other foreign fighters gained huge followings lennox lewis , for example none served in government while boxing this week , pacquiao joked that his congress can take roll call here , because more than 60 congressmen came to las vegas for the fight i'm not sure any fighter has had that type of international coverage , ever , said keith kizer , executive director of the nevada athletic commission kizer said the buzz surrounding fight weeks has come later in recent years , starting a week before , not three yet this fight sold out two weeks after tickets hit the market , for a projected 118 million in gross sales , which would rank ninth for all fights the commission , kizer said , receives 6 percent of the gate , in addition to a 50 , 000 fee , good for 758 , 000 , based on the projection one fight , kizer added , basically covers our entire budget according to , the average price of a pacquiaomarquez ticket is 42 percent higher \( 1 , 049 \) than a ticket to mayweather s fight in september against victor ortiz \( 610 \) the nevada gaming commission releases data monthly in pacquiao s last triumph , , the amount made by the casinos increased 289 percent compared with the same month a year earlier that figure was boosted by a large baccarat tournament , which was helped by pacquiao s presence but even that only covers some of the effect the rest falls under the nongambling category , for which pacquiao serves as a magnet for visitors , for those who buy tickets and spend money and those who come to be part of the ecosystem around each fight as the director of marketing at the las vegas convention and visitors authority , kevin bagger helps oversee a survey of 3 , 600 visitors over a calendar year to determine what the average person spends on everything besides gambling , including restaurants , bars , souvenirs and rental cars for 2010 , the average was 645 by multiplying that average with the gate attendance , the visitors authority arrives at an estimated nongaming economic impact for each fight , usually in the range of 6 million to 12 million when pacquiao tangled with erik morales in november 2006 at the largercapacity thomas and mack center , the estimated nongambling economic impact was 129 million , the highest total in the past five years at casinos like mgm , swissman said , nongambling revenue accounts for 60 percent of total revenue he added that pacquiao was missed when he fought twice last year at cowboys stadium in arlington , tex major fights hold another advantage , according to scott voeller , vice president for brand strategy and advertising at mgm resorts if the brand is strong enough , it does n't take a whole lot of advertising , he said if you have the right promoters , the right fighters , you 're able to reach the right customers without having to spend as much voeller said hotels typically reach out to such customers the week a championship bout is announced then they decorate the hotel with signs and posters and displays , so much so that it is hard to walk 10 feet in the mgm without some acknowledgement of the fight even the hotel s quarterly earnings calls often mention boxing and its influence on revenue , where one fight can register in cash registers the same way an eagles concert would pacquiao , though , seems unaware of the economic boost provided by his fists i'm here to fight , he said
east with tom brady and a bulkedup defense , the patriots are serving notice a terrifying thought suppose bill belichick spent the entire lockout in his laboratory conjuring up a pass rush \? that s how it looked for parts of the patriots' preseason if it holds up during the season , with the addition of shaun ellis , albert haynesworth and andre carter , the patriots will hark back to their title years when , even with the presence of tom brady , they relied heavily on their defense as for brady , he was absurd last season , throwing 36 touchdown passes and only 4 interceptions and that was while the patriots were exiling randy moss and making their offense more reliant on their superb tight ends with rob gronkowski and aaron hernandez no longer rookies , wes welker free of knee issues , and chad ochocinco joining a revived deion branch , brady could be even better but the offensive line looked startlingly shaky in the preseason , perhaps the only cause for concern for what may be the conference s best team still , it will be up to the defense to hold the leads and get the big victories that have eluded the patriots in recent years if they do , anything less than an appearance in the afc championship game would be a letdown when the jets beat the patriots in the playoffs last season , it seemed a changing of the division guard was about to take place now the jets face a more vexing proposition are they any better than the team that has twice gone to the conference championship game , only to lose \? mark sanchez , in his third season at quarterback , should improve and if receiver plaxico burress can stay healthy and productive for an entire season not a given even before his time in prison he would help sanchez , who struggles with accuracy in the red zone but the offensive line has looked vulnerable and the jets are still trying to develop a pass rush without blitzing still , even if they are close to the same old jets suddenly , that s a compliment they seem likely to earn at least another wildcard spot the dolphins' preseason began with the nonetoopromising scene of fans at a practice chanting for a quarterback the team tried and failed to acquire in earshot of the current quarterback for a franchise that also watched its owner fly crosscountry to woo a coaching candidate for a job that was taken , maybe this did n't seem unusual quarterback chad henne and coach tony sparano are still with miami , though , for better or worse in the case of henne , he will have an assist from the newly acquired reggie bush , as long as the dolphins recognize he is not a traditional betweenthetackles runner and use him to create mismatches with defenses that could inject some life into a somnolent offense the defense , though , will have to carry the dolphins again , and the unit is capable of doing it , with star players all over the field the schedule is tough early , with games against the patriots and the jets in a difficult conference , the dolphins will probably not make the playoffs who knows what strangeness will ensue \? continuity is precious in 2011 , and the bills have plenty of it they are casting their lot with quarterback ryan fitzpatrick , who nearly engineered upsets of three playoff teams last season most of the big contributors on defense are back too the one big new face is brad smith , the multidimensional former jets receiver returner quarterback , whose versatility should provide the offense with a spark and unpredictability the other positive the bills have a relatively easy nondivision schedule they should do better than their four wins last season , but it will be tough to make up ground on the patriots or the jets , although they could at least tie the dolphins west if their special teams cooperate , the chargers should rule the division it s rare that if a team could just get its special teams not to implode , it would probably win its division , but that is the state of the chargers , who ended with the topranked offense and defense last season they have one of the nfl s best quarterbacks in philip rivers , who , despite a series of injuries and holdouts to practically everyone around him last season , completed 66 percent of his passes with 30 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions although the defense lost its coordinator , ron rivera , to the head coaching job in carolina , the system is not changing under greg manusky but the special teams were almost comically awful last season , giving up four touchdowns and four blocked punts if they merely bring their level up to competent several of the defensive rookies will almost certainly play special teams , and the unit has a new coach , rich bisaccia the chargers are clearly the class of the division can norv turner get them beyond that , though \? that seems unlikely with the patriots and the steelers in the way the chiefs took advantage of the chargers' stumble last season to grab the division title , with big improvements on both sides of the ball charlie weis is gone as the offensive coordinator , though , and quarterback matt cassel , who excelled under him early and struggled down the stretch last season , could take a step back , at least temporarily , under the new coordinator , bill muir the chiefs have a bit of talent to help cassel , though , in running back jamaal charles , receiver dwayne bowe and tight end tony moeaki charles will probably receive a heavy workload as the chiefs try to smooth the transition the defense is luckier romeo crennel returns as the coordinator , and this unit is loaded with young talent , particularly in the secondary but the chiefs have a problem their schedule is much more difficult than last season s , particularly a lateseason stretch in which they face the patriots , the steelers , the bears , the jets and the packers if they can survive that , they chiefs will be super bowl contenders more likely , even though they might be improving , it will kill their chances to win the division
kabul , afghanistan insurgents attacked a district government center in eastern afghanistan on thursday while american troops were meeting with local officials inside , wounding three american soldiers and killing three afghan police officers , according to afghan and american officials the attack was carried out by a group of 5 to 10 insurgents , some wearing suicide vests , who also took two afghan officials hostage at the chamkani district government building in paktia province , said master sgt nicholas conner , a spokesman for the natoled international security assistance force troops in eastern afghanistan the hostages included the local chief of the national directorate of security , the afghan intelligence service , as well as the deputy governor of the district , he said it was unclear whether fighting had completely ended by nightfall , with varying accounts from officials it was also unclear what had happened to the hostages who had been taken , but afghan officials said no one was still being held after the fighting died down thursday night a spokesman for the taliban , zabiullah mujahid , reached by telephone at an undisclosed location , said that we have taken over the district center sergeant conner said technically , i guess you could say they have control of the building at this time , just like a bank robber has control of the bank when he takes hostages the attack came as the taliban leadership released a statement on the group s web site on thursday mocking claims by the secretary general of nato , anders fogh rasmussen , that taliban attacks had been declining , and citing contrary information from other enemy officials that they had been increasing the taliban claims were reported by site , an organization that monitors jihadi and extremist web sites show that enemy attacks declined by 8 percent during the first nine months of this year compared with the year before the united nations , on the other hand , reported in september that insurgent attacks had increased by 39 percent in the first eight months of this year referring to the gradual drawdown of military forces that has begun in afghanistan , the taliban statement read , if rasmussen and all his allies leave afghanistan completely then the attacks on them will reach zero , and he can propagate the notion even more and say that the number of taliban attacks have fallen further the attack in paktia began around 4 pm when one of the attackers exploded his vest at the gate of the district government compound , allowing the others to enter , officials said inside , american and afghan officials had been discussing continuing talks on a future strategic partnership agreement between their two countries , local officials said an american apache helicopter responded to the scene and received heavy machine gun fire from a second team of insurgents holed up in a nearby mosque , sergeant conner said after seeking permission from afghan officials , the helicopter fired missiles at the mosque and destroyed it they only engaged where they were taking fire from , and only after coordinating with the deputy governor of paktia province , he said the district police chief , habib nour , was also among the wounded , according to ruhullah samoun , the spokesman for the provincial governor chamkani district is strategically situated along the afghanistanpakistan border , in a rugged mountainous area that has seen a great deal of taliban activity thursday s attack was one of several in the past few months targeting heavily guarded government and military centers in july , the , capital of oruzgan province , killing 21 people , mostly civilians in august , , capital of parwan province , a normally peaceful area in northern afghanistan , killing 22 people in september , it took the authorities about 20 hours to completely subdue a taliban and isaf headquarters more than 20 people died in all , although none of the victims were from the embassy or the coalition military in october , their target was , and while the attack failed , it stunned locals in the most antitaliban part of the country american officials have said that the taliban have been seeking highprofile targets to compensate for the decline in their overall capacity to attack coalition forces in the field

seattle the spent most of the week being derided as the worst team ever to enter the nfl playoffs history will remember these postseason interlopers for perpetrating one of the game s biggest upsets the surprising seahawks , 79 in the regular season , beat the defending champion , 4136 , on the strength of matt hasselbeck s four touchdown passes , a spongy defense that stiffened at the right moments and the consistent cacophony of 66 , 336 spectators at qwest field the seahawks , suddenly recast as the best sub500 team in playoff history , will go on the road to play either the atlanta falcons or the chicago bears next weekend we 're not satisfied , said tight end john carlson , who caught two touchdown passes we 're not even 500 yet running back marshawn lynch rumbled 67 startandstop yards for the game s clinching touchdown with 3 minutes 22 seconds left to give seattle a 4130 lead breaking a halfdozen tackles as if he were made of soap , lynch stomped out the growing gloom that accompanied the impending dusk as the saints seemed positioned for a comeback seattle succumbed to another in a string of long scoring drives by quarterback drew brees and the saints before carlson captured the onside kickoff with 1 30 remaining coach pete carroll , in his first year with the seahawks , raised his arms as the final seconds ticked away and fireworks shot off above the stadium we kind of expected to win , carroll said i know that sounds crazy , but we did expect to win the fact that it happened , it s just kind of like , we want to take it in stride and go to the next one the seahawks were the first team with a losing record to make the playoffs in a nonstrike year but they also had a division title , something the wildcard saints \( 115 \) did not that meant the seahawks got to play at home amid some of the nfl s most vociferous fans and the northwest s chilly , damp weather the saints had mostly pressure on their side they were the largest road favorite in postseason history \( 11 points \) and a franchise that had never won a playoff road game i 've been the heavy favorite , seattle receiver brandon stokley said two days before the game all of a sudden , you get in a heavy game , and it s uhoh it s not supposed to be like this' you start feeling the pressure if we can battle with them , get that thing into the fourth quarter , then doubt starts creeping in their minds the saints jumped to a quick 100 lead , and the game looked to be taking its expected , lopsided course hasselbeck threw an interception on his third pass not exactly how you want to start a game , he said carroll approached him on the sideline you cannot win or lose the game in the first quarter , the coach said the usually anemic seahawks began moving the ball as if they had switched uniforms with the saints' dynamic offense between possessions hasselbeck soon led the seahawks on a touchdown drive , capped by an 11yard throw to carlson that brought temporary equilibrium to the contest seattle outscored new orleans by 3410 from midway through the first quarter to the end of the third hasselbeck , who missed the last regularseason game and most of the one before it with a hip injury , completed 22 of 35 passes for 272 yards to come in in this atmosphere , with everything at stake , and to play like he did shows what a professional he is , stokley said and what a great quarterback he really is on paper , the game should not have been close the saints brought the league s sixthbest offense \( 3725 yards a game \) and fourthbest defense \( 3062 yards \) the seahawks were 28th in offense \( 2978 yards \) and 27th in defense \( 3686 yards \) the seahawks lost all nine of their games by at least 15 points none of their players made the pro bowl all that was a preamble to a game as dizzying in its action as it was confounding in its outcome with each move of the chains , qwest field rumbled with hope with each touchdown , it quaked with belief the seahawks pulled ahead for the first time with 1 15 left in the second quarter hasselbeck lobbed a 45yard touchdown pass to stokley even the saints' spirited response 11 plays , 77 yards and a short field goal on the half s final play could not dampen the sense that one of the nfl s more memorable games was unfolding hasselbeck s prettiest completion may have been the touchdown that capped the first drive of the second half a 38yard lob over the shoulder of mike williams that sent fans into delirium the seahawks had a 3120 lead and the saints seemed far , far from home , and last year s super bowl the saints did not go meekly trailing by two touchdowns to start the fourth quarter , they punctuated an 87yard drive with a 4yard touchdown run by julius jones seattle s lead was 3427 with 13 11 left the seahawks punted after three plays the saints marched downfield again , only to be stopped inside the 10yard line for the third time garrett hartley kicked his third field goal of 26 yards or less just imagine if we could have gotten one more touchdown , two more , out of those three stops , said brees , who completed 39 of 60 passes for 404 yards and 2 touchdowns at the end of last season , brees held his young son in his arms as confetti fell on the super bowl champions this time , hasselbeck beamed as his children cavorted on the field in the locker room later , as hasselbeck dressed , carroll sat down next to him the two spoke in whispers henry hasselbeck , age 5 , drew up plays on a nearby dryerase board the seahawks surprise , surprise have more work to do
chicago in the eyes of some , s victory in this city s mayoral race marks the end to a minor political skirmish but the start of far larger chaos this city has had one mayor , richard m daley , for 22 years , and , like his approach or hate it , chicago has certainly grown used to it so when mr emanuel , the former chief of staff to president obama , moves into the fifth floor at city hall in may , it is expected to upend the politics of this city not only because things have been mostly the same here for so long , but also because of mr emanuel s harsh style , his relationships and rivals , and the enormous challenges facing the nation s thirdlargest city there will be more turmoil , kenneth gould , a suburban chicago resident , said recently , as the outcome of tuesday s race an outright victory by mr emanuel became increasingly likely rahm will make more noise indeed , in his very first news conference as mayorelect , mr emanuel on wednesday made it perfectly clear that change is coming this election is about reform , he said , adding at another point , i will reach out my hand to everybody to work for reform whatever the noise , it will probably be heard far beyond the city limits mr emanuel s close tie to mr obama who made a point to issue a statement saying that mr emanuel would be a terrific mayor means that people outside chicago will be taking note of mr emanuel s every move , his successes , his flops since he returned from the white house last fall to run for mayor , mr emanuel has toned down his sometimes biting , outspoken style , but many people here are waiting to see whether the tone will flip back as he begins wrestling over policies with the city s 50 aldermen before he even takes office , there are signs of serious tumult alderman ed burke , one of the city council s most veteran members , supported one of mr emanuel s opponents in the campaign and before election day , mr emanuel had suggested mr burke might want to brace for the new mayor , indicating during a debate that mr burke might need to give up part of his security detail , and that some committee chairmanships \( mr burke leads the powerful finance committee \) might well change at the news conference , mr emanuel maintained the calm , friendly attitude he had on the campaign trail he said he planned to work with the city council to accomplish his agenda when a reporter asked about a possible conflict with the powerful mr burke , mr emanuel laughed and said , i'm so proud of you guys , it only took three questions to get to that i have said this is going to be a new partnership , mr emanuel said of working with the city council they cannot be a rubber stamp that s unacceptable the challenges are too big they do n't want it , the city does n't want it , and i do n't want it i was a former legislator the city also knows that we paid a price for council wars those two extremes rubber stamp and council wars are unacceptable i ask them to be partners in reform if they have ideas of how to save money , walk right up to my office mr daley s relationship with the city s aldermen was simple with a few exceptions , they did as he pleased but if they wish to , the city council here can hold plenty of sway and with a crew of new aldermen likely to arrive after the election on tuesday and a runoff election in april , and another set of aldermen whose political lives have been due , at least in part , to appointments by mr daley , the council s relationship with the incoming mayor appears utterly volatile it is clear that mr emanuel has an enormous challenge ahead , making it all the more likely that drastic , painful sorts of change are unavoidable mr emanuel has not shied away from change he has already pledged to hire 1 , 000 new police officers , to change the way garbage is collected , and to shift the sales tax to cover fancy services like , in mr emanuel s words , a mango facial for a dog \( he will need state legislative help to shift the sales tax that way \) i think rahm is going to break a lot of rules , said evan gordon , 51 , who attended mr emanuel s victory party on tuesday night more than one voter said they expected mr emanuel would promptly clean house , removing all sorts of staff members he needs to answer a budget deficit above 600 million , by some estimates tackle gripping worries about safety , jobs and schools and deal with the contentious issue of whether to lower pension benefits for city workers \( mr emanuel himself says he will take no pension \) the pension question , especially , has firefighters and police officers worried , and mr emanuel did little to soothe those concerns a day after his election it is a big hole , mr emanuel said of the city s unfunded pension liabilities it ca n't be fixed easily a convincing campaign is one thing governing can be far more difficult of the city s major financial worries , don rose , a political consultant , said none of the candidates not even mr emanuel had addressed the problem in a significant way it s all nibbling around the edges , and that s not possible anymore , mr rose said the only choice left , many here said , was something dramatic and surprising something that would turn things upside down
disparities in victories , statistics and payroll rarely register when the rangers and islanders meet although the visiting rangers entered the latest installment of the rivalry having won their last six games , while the islanders had lost 9 of their previous 10 , the rangers could not exhale until the final seconds of their 42 victory tuesday night at nassau coliseum whenever we play in this building , it s up and down , over and about , rangers coach john tortorella said you just never know what s going to happen i thought we were good at periods of times i thought we were brutal at periods of times we ve been on the back side of these , in this building we ve lost a lot of games here but it s an encouraging sign that we found a way to win the game was intense throughout , a crowdpleaser and coachpleaser , undecided until brad richards took advantage of a josh bailey giveaway to break a 22 tie with just under five minutes left when the puck dropped , all streaks and slumps flew out the window so what if the islanders were 163 since beating the rangers on oct 15 \? it mattered little that the rangers were the hottest team in the nhl i thought we gutted it out , said ryan callahan , the rangers captain , who had an assist and scored an emptynet goal as time expired i thought we stuck to our plan there were a lot of emotional swings in this game nothing comes easy it rarely does when facing a geographical rival , despite the personal and team statistics the islanders did not resemble the league s 29thplace team jack capuano s club is battling an epic scoring slump , having already been shut out at home three times kyle okposo , the islanders firstround pick in 2006 , was a healthy scratch after failing to score a goal in the first 14 games of the season blake comeau , a thirdline wing with 24 goals last season , was held without a goal or assist by the rangers a seasonopening drought of 13 games bailey , the goat , is a recent ninth overall draft pick with no goals and only one assist this season while the rangers defensemen brad park or brian leetch , none of them have scored 11 goals this season , the islanders have not seen a goal from any of their defensemen during evenstrength play this was about the only trend that held tuesday night in uniondale but even when the rangers took a 21 lead in the middle of the second period on a goal by defenseman steve eminger , the islanders generated more scoring chances for the next several minutes the rangers , however , had henrik lundqvist in goal displaying his love for soccer , he blocked shots with his head dropping his stick and sprawling his pads across the crease to make a stunning save on p a parenteau late in the period , lundqvist drew echoes of dominik hasek hank kept us in it , tortorella said of lundqvist , who is 22115 in his career against the islanders after kicking the habit of committing too many penalties during their six straight wins , the rangers gave the islanders five power plays in a 25minute span over the final two periods the islanders finally took advantage of the fifth one while artem anisimov sat in the box for highsticking , the islanders young star john tavares slid a perfect pass to the crease , past a surprised dan girardi and on the stick of matt moulson , who scored to tie the game at 6 minutes 58 seconds of the third period puck possession and battle levels were even for most of the third until bailey s shanked clearing attempt went from brandon dubinsky to richards and past islanders goaltender evgeni nabokov , whose acrobatic play between the pipes was almost the equal of lundqvist s we had a lot of guys work very hard tonight , said capuano , who has some legitimately positive video to build on if the islanders compete as ferociously in their coming games against montreal , boston and pittsburgh as they did tuesday against the rangers , they will rise from the basement of the eastern conference but that has been the question in uniondale for a generation can the islanders sustain a high level of play and tenacity when the old barn isn t as crowded and the opponent not nearly as loathed \? as for the rangers , they will look for their eighth straight win when they play saturday in montreal the last time the blueshirts won eight straight was during the 197475 season
reading the transcript of tuesday s republican debate on the economy is , for anyone who has actually been following economic events these past few years , like falling down a rabbit hole suddenly , you find yourself in a fantasy world where nothing looks or behaves the way it does in real life and since economic policy has to deal with the world we live in , not the fantasy world of the gop s imagination , the prospect that one of these people may well be our next president is , frankly , terrifying in the real world , recent events were a devastating refutation of the freemarket orthodoxy that has ruled american politics these past three decades above all , the long crusade against financial regulation , the successful effort to unravel the prudential rules established after the great depression on the grounds that they were unnecessary , ended up demonstrating at immense cost to the nation that those rules were necessary , after all but down the rabbit hole , none of that happened we did n't find ourselves in a crisis because of runaway private lenders like countrywide financial we did n't find ourselves in a crisis because wall street pretended that slicing , dicing and rearranging bad loans could somehow create aaa assets and private rating agencies played along we did n't find ourselves in a crisis because shadow banks like lehman brothers exploited gaps in financial regulation to create banktype threats to the financial system without being subject to banktype limits on risktaking no , in the universe of the republican party we found ourselves in a crisis because representative barney frank forced helpless bankers to lend money to the undeserving poor ok , i'm exaggerating a bit but not much mr frank s name did come up repeatedly as a villain in the crisis , and not just in the context of the doddfrank financial reform bill , which republicans want to repeal you have to marvel at his alleged influence given the fact that he s a democrat and the vast bulk of the bad loans now afflicting our economy were made while george w bush was president and republicans controlled the house with an iron grip but he s their preferred villain all the same the demonization of mr frank aside , it s now obviously orthodoxy on the republican side that government caused the whole problem so what you need to know is that this orthodoxy has hardened even as the supposed evidence for government as a major villain in the crisis has been discredited the fact is that government rules did n't force banks to make bad loans , and that governmentsponsored lenders , while they behaved badly in many ways , accounted for few of the truly highrisk loans that fueled the housing bubble but that s history what do the republicans want to do now \? in particular , what do they want to do about unemployment \? well , they want to fire ben bernanke , the chairman of the federal reserve not for doing too little , which is a case one can make , but for doing too much so they 're obviously not proposing any jobcreation action via monetary policy incidentally , during tuesday s debate , mitt romney named harvard s n gregory mankiw as one of his advisers how many republicans know that correctly , in my view deliberate inflation by the fed to solve our economic woes \? so , no monetary relief what else \? well , the cheshire catlike rick perry he seems to be fading out , bit by bit , until only the hair remains claimed , implausibly , that he could create 12 million jobs in the energy sector mr romney , meanwhile , called for permanent tax cuts basically , let s replay the bush years ! and herman cain \? oh , never mind by the way , has anyone else noticed the disappearance of budget deficits as a major concern for republicans once they start talking about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy \? it s all pretty funny but it s also , as i said , terrifying the great recession should have been a huge wakeup call nothing like this was supposed to be possible in the modern world everyone , and i mean everyone , should be engaged in serious soulsearching , asking how much of what he or she thought was true actually is n't but the gop has responded to the crisis not by rethinking its dogma but by adopting an even cruder version of that dogma , becoming a caricature of itself during the debate , the hosts played a clip of ronald reagan calling for increased revenue today , no politician hoping to get anywhere in reagan s party would dare say such a thing it s a terrible thing when an individual loses his or her grip on reality but it s much worse when the same thing happens to a whole political party , one that already has the power to block anything the president proposes and which may soon control the whole government
arlington , va for all the welldeserved hoopla attending the transcendent performance by rory mcilroy , a 22yearold from northern ireland , his recordsetting victory at congressional country club on sunday did not come without some cautionary notes for the game mcilroy s eightstroke victory was the fifth straight win by an international golfer in a major championship before this year , the last time no american had held one of the four grand slam titles was 1994 with mcilroy s move to no 4 in the , international players hold 7 of the top 10 spots , including the top 4 s observation before the open was even truer afterward it s obvious that world golf as a whole has become so much stronger and that international and european golf has become world class and top notch certainly in the rankings right now , mickelson said in a news conference before the start of the open he also concluded that american golf was still in very good shape , a position shared by ernie els of south africa and graeme mcdowell of northern ireland , the 2010 united states open winner to be sure , this present international golf dominance is good for global expansion of the game what more could a golfrelated business with global aspirations ask for \? the south africanborn charl schwartzel as the masters champion mcilroy , an appealing , freshfaced talent with the united states open trophy a south african , louis oosthuizen , with the british open title and martin kaymer of germany as the pga championship winner with golf s return to the olympics in 2016 , any company with the worldwide expansion of the game written into its fiveyear plans is ecstatic the pga european tour is pleased after mcilroy s victory , chubby chandler , whose international sports management organization represents three of the four major winners , was proper chuffed , as the british would put it the picture is a bit murkier in the short term for united states interests the saturday and sunday nielsen ratings for the open were down about 26 percent the drop is explainable in that last year s broadcast was shown in prime time from scenic pebble beach and mickelson and tiger woods were in the mix , finishing tied for fourth the current cycle for golf in the united states is similar to one in 1986 , when the top four spots in the sony rankings , the precursor to the world golf ranking , were held by greg norman of australia , bernhard langer of germany , seve ballesteros of spain and tommy nakajima of japan andy bean at no 5 was the highestranked united states player steve stricker is currently the highestranked american , at no 5 mark mccormack , the founder of img , took american professionals to task in 1987 , saying they had become complacent he added , they do not care enough to become champions the culprits were college golf and the pga tour , mccormack said by eliminating match play and deemphasizing individual performance in their tournaments , he said , colleges trained nonwinners , and the pga tour compounded the problem with its top125 exemption policy and pursedistribution structure he recommended the radical cure of heavily weighting purse distribution so the winner would collect 50 percent , the runnerup 20 percent and the thirdplace finisher 10 percent with 5 percent to fourth place and the remaining 15 percent to players in spots 5 through 12 although none of his suggestions were adopted , american golf did go through a resurgence in 1987 , with americans winning three of the four majors a year later , they won two more , including the first of curtis strange s consecutive united states open titles , and three again in 1989 this trend will probably also cycle through , although there was some concern earlier this year when bill haas , one of the pga tour s better young players , who won twice in 2010 , said what he really wanted was to be able to have 13 top 10s , because even without winning , that s a better year than my year last year , in my opinion , when i won twice if that particular motivation were to become widespread , there might be cause for alarm about the state of american golf , where 5 million is on offer each week and finishing ninth is worth 150 , 000 jack nicklaus , who knows what separates good from great , was asked sunday night what he would tell mcilroy about how to avoid the pitfalls of early success in this day and age , it s very difficult , he said i hope he understands he is a golfer first he will be and already is a celebrity , but he is a golfer first right now , he is a very good golfer , but if he wants to be a great golfer , he needs to learn how to deal with it and learn how to handle all the things on the side he needs to make certain golf is the first thing , as well as his motivation and desire to be great , nicklaus continued tiger had records on the wall as his motivation my motivation was that i wanted to be the best i could be in the sport , and once i got close to bob jones s record , that became a motivation collecting 13 top 10 finishes would mean a minimum of 19 million in earnings but , as a motivator , it does not lead to a green jacket , a united states open trophy , a claret jug or a wanamaker trophy
a young man stands slouching on the stoop of a crumbling lower east side tenement his back is turned , but he cocks his head toward the camera , his eyes hidden behind dark shades beside him , staring straight ahead , are three other young men who will soon become famous yet 46 years later the fourth is still a sphinx rock scholars might recognize as one of the earliest portraits of the , shot on ludlow street in mid1965 , and a close look reveals familiar details lou reed s smirk , john cale s spotless black suit , a sullen sterling morrison the head scratcher is angus maclise , whose role as the band s original drummer has earned him a permanent footnote in the annals of music but with a new gallery exhibition that documents maclise s expansive career as a musician , poet , visual artist and allaround downtown shaman , he may finally be getting some recognition angus was one of the greatest drummers of all time and one of the greatest poets of all time , said the composer la monte young , whose pioneering 1960s drone group the theater of eternal music included maclise and mr cale maclise died in 1979 , in katmandu , nepal , leaving little on the standard historical record he appears on none of the velvet underground s commercial recordings , having quit on the eve of the band s first paid gigs he was so dedicated a bohemian that , according to both mr reed and mr cale , he could not tolerate somebody telling him when to start playing and when to stop \( his replacement was the much better known maureen tucker \) but over the last decade a handful of musicians and historians have been exhuming tape after tape , document after document , to resuscitate maclise s reputation as a key participant in the underground culture of new york in the '60s the latest of these finds might be maclise s rosetta stone a suitcase stuffed with his poems , drawings , photographs and other ephemera , lent to mr young by maclise s widow , hetty , and left in mr young s basement for decades the contents of the suitcase form the core of which opens on tuesday at the boohooray gallery in chelsea the show s curators , will swofford cameron and johan kugelberg , contend that it further bolsters maclise s status as a human link document connecting beat poetry , the art scenes of fluxus and andy warhol s factory , psychedelic film , rock and the classical avantgarde this provides a completely different history of the '60s and '70s than we 're used to , mr cameron said some of the pieces in dreamweapon make a case for maclise s significance by association a flier for an eighthour happening in 1965 with warhol , burroughs , ginsberg , the fugs a handwritten note to his friend ira cohen , at 76 others trace maclise s brand of mystical eccentricity through various artistic movements dead language press , which maclise founded in paris in 1958 with his high school friend piero heliczer , published early work by the beat poet gregory corso and the filmmaker jack smith , as well as maclise s pamphlet year , from about 1960 , which lays out an alternative calendar , with new names for every day \( day of the smoking plain , diedricsday \) mr young and marian zazeela , his wife and collaborator , still use it maclise spent most of the 1970s in nepal , where he printed his poetry in tiny editions and drew in a fantastical calligraphy of his own creation that resembles arabic or sanskrit mr kugelberg brushes aside the question of whether the symbols are a form of language it s an inner poetry , he said , likening maclise s process to the subconscious automatic writing of the surrealists but if maclise himself comes across as a cipher , a character to be interpreted through scraps of writing or in a few jarring photographs like one taken near the end of his life , in which a grim reaper figure creeps toward him it s no accident his friends and colleagues remember him as inhabiting some distant poetic plane and as being full of creative inspiration but also unknowably remote he might show up for band rehearsal or might not if he did , he might begin playing before anyone else arrived and continue long after everybody had put their instruments down like plenty of others at the time he took copious amounts of drugs , but he seemed particularly neglectful of his own health his death , at 41 , was caused by hypoglycemia , exacerbated by years of drug use , his family said \( the cause has also been reported as malnutrition \) angus was a floater , mr cale said he spoke in a semiwhisper , and it was always kind of in awe of something i just got the idea that here was a drifter chasing after his soul the composer terry riley , who said maclise had a very jupiterian personality \( expansive , with a big sense of gravity , he explained \) , remembers him as a spontaneous merrymaker who also seemed barely mindful of his own dark side sometimes he 'd be found unconscious on the streets , mr riley said he just was n't a person who was concerned about whether he 'd be living tomorrow or not angus william maclise was born in bridgeport , conn , in 1938 , the son of a book dealer he had some formal training as a percussionist , but by the early 1960s his playing had become so idiosyncratic that many assumed he was selftaught mr young was then developing his drone style with the theater of eternal music , letting the natural harmonics of longheld tones ring out loudly , sometimes for hours maclise s rhythms , on hand drums like bongos or tablas , sputtered in rapid , complex patterns like pressured speech , but they never coalesced into anything like a steady beat he almost never kept a beat , said the composer tony conrad , a veteran of the group , still sounding amazed he kept less beat than any drummer i 've heard before or since it was astonishing in the inventiveness , the continual renewal that that required dreamweapon includes a related sound installation of some of that music at 265 canal street , and on thursday the will screen some macliserelated films , including mr cohen s from 1968 that film and some other material in the show reveal another side to maclise the pastoral nature boy in the middle of the lower east side , covering his body in algaecolored paint or jamming with a flutist in the park no wonder he did n't quite fit in the velvet underground he was kind of a hippie avant la lettre , mr conrad said way before the hippies he was a hippie in some kind of perfect form the rediscovery of maclise s work has progressed slowly beginning in 1999 a handful of cds were , mostly drawn from homemade tapes the scarcity of materials has hindered historians from sorting out just how significant maclise really was , and the curators of dreamweapon say that one of their goals is simply to help that process along but to some extent the mystery of maclise is itself important , an indication that the history of art and music in the 1960s has not entirely been told there are still connections to be sorted out , discoveries that can change the overall picture of a time we still tell history from the point of view of the victors , especially with anything having to do with rock music , said branden w joseph , an art professor at columbia university who a figure like angus maclise is someone who shows that there are all these other directions not only that one could have gone , but in fact people did go mr cameron and mr kugelberg met through mutual pursuit of the maclise legend mr cameron , 30 , worked with mr cohen on the recovery of the invasion of thunderbolt pagoda , in which maclise appears and for which he composed the soundtrack that led to a meeting in london with hetty maclise , who told him about the suitcase mr kugelberg , 45 , is a veteran sleuth of popculture ephemera and was looking for maclise materials while editing the velvet underground new york art , published by rizzoli two years ago it has taken them two years to sort through the contents of the suitcase and the more than 100 reels of tape they found with it , and in the meantime collectors came out of the woodwork to lend their own maclise materials after decades with just a trickle of available material , mr cameron and mr kugelberg now believe they have a critical mass when it rains , it pours , mr kugelberg said i believe that the stuff decides when it wants to be found
superbesse sancy , france \( ap \) rui alberto costa of portugal won the eighth stage of the after withstanding a late attack from philippe gilbert on saturday , while thor hushovd kept the leader s yellow jersey costa waved his hands in delight and then punched the air as he clinched the first tour stage win of his career i knew i could get in the breakaway today the team put me in the best position , said costa , who rides for team movistar i was lucky that i managed to hold on until the end i'm very happy with this win the race entered the mountains for the first time , a 117mile slog from aigurande to superbesse sancy featuring a sharp category 2 climb up col de la croix and a final climb of one mile hushovd of norway , who has been wearing the yellow jersey for a week and is not known as a climber , said he had expected to lose the yellow jersey maybe i was a bit pessimistic , he said i did n't think i could do it alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan closed within 15 seconds of costa in the last mile , but he began to flag and had no teammates to help him gilbert of belgium was fresher after staying with the main pack for much of the day s climbs he overtook vinokourov after starting an attack with about a quarter mile left none of the main tour contenders lost any significant time , though the defending champion alberto contador of spain , andy schleck of luxembourg and cadel evans of australia tested one another with miniattacks it was interesting to see how every one would end up , contador said i can see we are all very close it s very important to get the measure of other contenders since gilbert is not considered an overall tour contender , the leaders did not feel the need to chase him down when he went after vinokourov although contador thinks he could easily have caught him i had felt very , very good today , contador said i was capable of following gilbert evans is looking forward to trying another attack on sunday s ninth stage , which also features several climbs i have a very good team that s been working very hard every day , evans said let s wait and see what happens tomorrow nine riders charged ahead early , but only four remained by the time the col de la croix appeared on the horizon a challenging ascent lasting four miles at an average gradient of 62 percent just before the pack arrived , vinokourov , 37 , accelerated out of a corner , in the sort of blistering attack that has been his trademark the three riders who went over col de la croix with costa were tejay van garderen of the united states and the frenchmen cyril gautier and christophe riblon vinokourov was tucked in about a minute behind but gained time on a descent made tougher by rainfall that made roads slippery when i saw that vinokourov was getting closer , costa said , i thought it would be difficult also saturday , bradley wiggins s team sky said he would have surgery to repair his broken left collarbone and was expected back on his bike within 10 days
david brooks gail , i know you re busy with a book deadline on top of everything else , so i will try not to impose any heavy lifting my simple question is this if the greeks end up rejecting the eu bailout offer , how should the french and german banks restructure their amortization schedules \? don t worry , i m kidding i m not even sure i know what amortization means , except that it derives from the french word amour , meaning love , and the german word , tization , which means one who has an erotic relationship with other people s credit reports my real subject today is herman cain gail collins i vote we go back to the eu david brooks let s start with the politics of it my first question is over whether the clinton statute of limitations has expired my assumption , post lewinsky scandal , was that for at least a decade no president or presidential candidate could be punished for an improper workplace relationship because if clinton could get away with it then no one else should suffer \( this excludes cases involving congressional pages , public bathrooms and barechested pictures delivered by email \) gail collins david , i am so pleased you brought this up because i once wrote a book about political scandals , most of which were about sex i now know quite a bit more about alexander hamilton s love life than i might have preferred anyhow , my conclusion was that american voters have a very transactional relationship with politicians they don t really care deep down about their moral behavior , as long as they can deliver of course , what they want this politician to deliver might be a social conservative agenda , but even then , private behavior doesn t make as much difference as you might think david brooks do you think cain can be excluded from the presidency based on what we know so far , given the clinton standard \? my impression , for what it s worth is that no , he can t even if everything that is alleged is true , this is less egregious than clinton gail collins go back to the congressmen with the barechested cellphone pictures or the lewd tweets why did they have to go away \? because the one thing voters will not abide is behavior that suggests the pol in question is a whack job david brooks my next observation concerns republican psychology the allegations have caused many republicans to rally around cain on liberal media hightech lynching grounds opposition to politico seems to arouse stronger passions among republican primary voters than any violation of a gentlemanly code of behavior i do think people who care about the general moral atmosphere should pause when allegations are made , even about people on their own political team gail collins i have to say that the line about liberals being terrified of a strong conservative black man is peculiar even for ann coulter we can only handle strong black men if they re in favor of capandtrade \? david brooks now we turn to ethical issues my first question , and this is a genuine question , concerns the victims let s detach ourselves from the specifics of the cain case and consider a general question if you are the victim of sexual harassment , and you agree to remain silent in exchange for a fivefigure payoff , should any moral taint attach to you \? in the old days , somebody who allowed a predator to continue his hunting in exchange for money would certainly be considered a sinner i m reluctant to judge people in these circumstances , but i m inclined to agree am i missing something \? gail collins sexual harassment is a matter so serious that i m not prepared to prejudge anybody , including the woman who accepted money in return for leaving the organization , until i have a pretty fair factual understanding of what actually happened if you feel you have no power , that everybody with clout is aligned against you , and the situation makes keeping your job untenable , you might feel compelled to just get out of there with whatever compensation is available to tide you over on the other side , if none of cain s accusers speak up in public , it s hard to judge him guilty however , if cain has an episode involving charges like that in his background , voters have a right to expect that before he ran for president of the united states he would have figured out how to explain his side of the story if it came up coherently explain without totally contradicting himself david brooks finally we turn to what cain is alleged to have done where is the harassment line these days \? if an employer asks a woman to come to his hotel room and she says no and he lets the matter drop , is that harassment \? i confess i m not sure i ve worked at places where people who worked together had romantic relationships i presume those relationships started with one person making an overture is it harassment if the overture is rejected but not harassment if the overture is accepted or is any overture between people at the same firm harassment on its face \? again , i m not saying this is proper behavior , i m just wondering if it s harassment gail collins if an employer asks someone he supervises to come to his hotel room that is probably harassment and most definitely a bad way to run a business there s a difference between coworkers having a romantic relationship and being propositioned by your boss david brooks then there are other vaguely described infractions cain is alleged to have made physical gestures that were not overtly sexual these made people uncomfortable don t know what to think of that is someone else s discomfort automatically a sign that something egregious is going on \? gail collins cain is alleged by cain to have made physical gestures that were not overtly sexual does he strike you as the most selfaware guy on the planet \? i think if you re respectful of the people around you , you are not going to have a problem just the other day i was talking with somebody whose boss asked a female underling at a company party if she was going to do a lap dance he probably thought this was hilarious but i guarantee you , this is not comfortcreating humor you know , back in the anita hill days i remember guys in some of the nation s newsrooms being shocked about the new rules for workplace behavior how could you have a normal collegial relationship among journalists if you had to watch every word \? if you couldn t make jokes about women s breasts or whether somebody was in a bad mood because she was having her period \? and then , when it became a matter of legal consequences , somehow most of those very same people managed to clean up their acts and get along perfectly well david brooks my own guess is that this specific sort of behavior is insensitive , creepy and , given that cain is married , sinful but is it disqualifying for someone trying to run for public office \? if i began this week firmly believing that herman cain would make a great president , should i end the week thinking the man is simply not fit \? gail collins i never bought into the electtheguyyouwanttohaveabeerwith theory of voting , but i don t think i m prepared to go as far as whocaresifhecreepsmeout and david , if you began the week believing that herman cain would make a great president , we would have much larger matters to discuss
jersey city for just a day the strokes have gone dandy in white tie and black , the last defiantly downtown rock band gathered here a few weeks ago to shoot the video for their new single , under cover of darkness set in a gilded with fraying edges , it was a complicated affair for a central shot the band members were positioned around an elegant dining table , complete with candelabra , chopping away at their instruments but the red velvet thronelike chair at the head of the table was empty where was julian \? julian casablancas , the singer and insistent frontman for the group that a decade ago revived louche new york city rock 'n' roll , was in a dressing room , listening for the first time to the final mix of the strokes' fourth album , angles , due on march 22 from rca he was pleased hallelujah in the the camera focuses on the empty chair as his vocals kick in later he struts around in rock star gear while his four band mates , in formal wear , play on , oblivious to one another none of the strokes quite understood the premise of the video the director , warren fu , a longtime collaborator , wanted to keep it mysterious , he said i think we 're supposed to be dead , fabrizio moretti , the evergenial drummer , puzzled over a beer on the set it has something to do with the shining , ' i think \? nikolai fraiture , the bassist , serious and dutiful , had read the treatment we 're supposed to be like the bartender in the shining , ' those kind of characters that are kind of ghostly , floating around , he offered later julian may be alive nick valensi , lead guitarist , wideeyed and deadpan i thought he s the ghost , and he does n't know it and fab is like haley joel osment mr casablancas \? they 're all ghosts , and i'm not , he concluded , a few days after the shoot at the end we 're all ghosts or something like that ask the strokes for one explanation , and you 'll get them in multiples , a lesson that the band , and its fans , have learned well since the group formed in 1998 then it had a unity of purpose cosmopolitan former prep schoolers dedicated to throwback guitardriven rock and the downtown lifestyle that went with it there was a moment for the rebirth of new york cool and these skinny dudes suddenly nimbly fit into it , molded it , inspired haircuts for it even the backlash , questioning their authenticity , seemed of a piece but over the years , as age , fame , addiction , solo projects and creative foment interceded , their vision striated with angles , their first album in five years , are embracing a new equilibrium , one that weighs each member s voice more equally or something like that it s just to get everyone happy , mr casablancas said evenly operation make everyone satisfied that state was difficult to achieve , professionally and personally , as the band is the result is an album with 10 highly workedover songs that are identifiably the strokes those counterpoint guitar riffs , mr casablancas s dyspeptic vocals , with their latenight energy and lyrical selfdoubt , a few synths and downbeats for modern measure but with a distinction for the first time the material was written not just by mr casablancas , who was absent by design , but by all the members and it was recorded not in a studio in new york city but in a bucolic setting upstate they 're not the mature strokes , exactly if i say that , said albert hammond jr , the rhythm guitarist , it almost sounds so boring , does n't it \? but they 're close whatever they are , an audience seems ready the band has sold out headlining dates at madison square garden and will play , with kanye west and others , the valley music arts festival in indio , calif , in april they 'll follow that with performances at jazzfest in new orleans and in tennessee the group s free show in an austin , tex , park is expected to be a highlight of this month the release of under cover of darkness , heralded as a return to the strokes' oldschool sound , crashed the music blogs and industry fans like lisa worden , the music director of kroqfm , the los angeles radio station that was an early champion , are agog with anticipation she put the strokes' single into rotation immediately , because we love them , she said but , she added , it was too soon to tell if the song would be a hit with listeners we 're still finding out the anticipation of the kroq audience , she said it s been a long time since it had to consider the strokes in the decade since their debut , is this it , went platinum , both the music business and the dominant aesthetic have shifted where once the strokes were a welcome deviation from a mainstream of slick pop , rap metal and electronica , now they are part of a wave of indieminded , guitarheavy bands , which they helped usher in even as sales expectations have dwindled a no 1 album can now mean just 40 , 000 copies sold online distribution has given bedroom acts as much exposure as major label finds in some circles the strokes have retained their appeal dj s play last nite' all the time , the young disc jockey mia moretti , in demand on the fashionartcelebrity scene , said of the band s bestknown single ms moretti \( no relation to the strokes drummer \) added that she would play new strokes songs at her regular gigs at new york clubs i think they 're still very sexy , ms moretti said of the members , now in their early 30s when the strokes began , though , guitar music was extremely unfashionable in new york , recalled gordon raphael , who produced their first two records still , in early 2001 the british music magazine nme gave their debut ep the modern age a glowing review , starting a hype cycle in england kate moss came to an early show in london , and by the time the unsigned group returned to new york , buzz had spread when the strokes opened for the doves , a british act , at the bowery ballroom , there were record company limousines around the block , mr raphael said \( that was , of course , when record companies still employed fleets of limousines \) rca won what was said to be a heated bidding war after is this it came out , i looked around the east village , and there were tons of boys with leather jackets carrying guitars on their backs , mr raphael said sometimes they were the strokes themselves in the early days they could often be seen marauding together downtown we lived in each other s pockets for several years straight , mr valensi said we 've been on tour and shared beds i wo n't get into it , but we 've been uncomfortably close yes , all the clich s of rock stardom applied , including notable girlfriends mr moretti dated drew barrymore mr hammond , the model agyness deyn and mr valensi , the photographer amanda de cadenet , whom he eventually married but out of sight they rehearsed as much as they partied on the day the lp of is this it was released sept 11 , 2001 they went to their rehearsal space to practice , mr moretti recalled that their debut coincided with the sept 11 attacks , and they joined acts like the yeah yeah yeahs and interpol in a resurgent local scene inevitably , though , the followups were not as popular as is this it , and by the third strokes album , first impressions of earth , there was evident tension despite mr casablancas s newfound sobriety , mr fraiture called that their worst recording experience after a 2006 tour the group s manager announced an openended break it was more openended than anyone expected in the yearslong interim all but mr valensi started side or solo projects they focused on their families mr casablancas , mr fraiture and mr valensi are married with children and splintered between new york and los angeles interviewed individually over several days in new jersey and the east village , each stroke admitted he 'd had his doubts about managing another album , and how it would be received there was trepidation that we would have been gone from people s hearts and minds somewhat , and that we would have to kind of start over again at a lower level , mr valensi said around 2007 he , mr fraiture and mr moretti returned to the studio we were trying to , by example , get the ball rolling , mr fraiture said by 2009 , he added , it was kind of the last ditch either this is happening , or it s not what drew them too was their fiverecord contract with rca angles is the fourth under that deal all five members finally returned to the music building where they 've had dingy rehearsal spaces for a decade to write , giving periodic thumbsup updates about their progress but soon enough mr casablancas went back on tour to promote his solo album and just as they were to begin recording , mr hammond had to leave i went to rehab , mr hammond said i just kind of hid , in drugs a lot of drugs i had to go fix myself when mr hammond returned , the group members began working anew , engaging the producer joe chiccarelli \( my morning jacket , the shins \) at a manhattan studio but the tracks they recorded there did not suit them it just sounded boring , mr hammond said , though his band mates had softer assessments \( mr chiccarelli is still credited \) the strokes repaired to mr hammond s place in upstate new york , living and recording together for weeks our first three records , we recorded them in manhattan in a super urbane vibe where you just order chinese food and like walk to work , and , i do n't know , call your weed delivery service , mr valensi said this one , we were pretty much in the middle of nowhere we 'd wake up early in the morning and , i kid you not , there would be a family of deer in the front yard like five feet away from the porch i remember nikolai , in between takes , literally chopping wood they each supplied material mr valensi wrote the album s first track , machu picchu the first time he has contributed a song and where was julian \? still on the road i definitely wanted to step back as much as possible , mr casablancas said he believed his style would be a roadblock i'm just very opinionated , he said over tea near his east village apartment even without him the process was tortured there s many versions of every song , said gus oberg , mr hammond s friend and producer who wound up producing most of angles it took a long time to get everyone to agree mr casablancas eventually weighed in i would say roughly 60 percent of what they did i thought was rad and i did n't touch , and then 40 percent i would either alter it or it got left behind , he said i try to keep a high standard he wrote and recorded lyrics independently , borrowing lines from his band mates occasionally , and trying to maintain that equilibrium having a solo outlet helps i think collaboration strokes' is more on the side of just poppy than what i am interested in personally , he added i 'll take what i can get , so i'm happy \( not totally asked if he was excited about touring , mr casablancas said no he was most animated talking about raising his infant son he and his wife , juliet , prefer cosleeping to having a crib \) by now the strokes are used to the obsessive interest in their band dynamic , and selfcorrect for it in interviews each took pains to note he was only speaking for himself all said that their problems stemmed from poor communication when they became a band , i think we were trying hard to seem like it came naturally , mr moretti said and i think now we embrace the fact that it s hard work which is not to say that the strokes , onetime paragons of youthful debauchery , are killjoys they are still fun to be around in one of the last shots for the video , the boys , now all in black tie on an orchestra stage , were to bow to one another they did take after take after take , because they could n't do it without cracking up
las vegas for much of his welterweight title defense on saturday , heard from the mgm grand crowd a unified sound rarely belted at his boxing matches as pacquiao and tapped gloves , made small talk and generally engaged in a glorified sparring session , the crowd , once rowdy , once standing , once into it , simply booed when it ended , pacquiao \( 5332 \) , the winner by unanimous decision , hung his head in victory he did not look happy neither did the crowd pacquiao counts i want to entertain the fans among his favorite phrases , and for much of the bout , he tried he knocked down mosley \( 46711 \) in the third round and stalked him throughout but this felt more like a first date than a typical night featuring pacquiao s furious fists he retained his world boxing organization belt , but without the usual panache as the decision was announced , his wife smiled nervously on the arena big screen even gus johnson , perhaps broadcasting s most excitable announcer , shrugged and shook his head as he walked from his frontrow seat we tried our best , pacquiao said we both tried our best the signs of the fight s pacing and style came early , perhaps as early as the sixth round , when someone in mosley s corner yelled , he s not your friend , shane ! still , mosley continued to engage far less than expected of course , pacquiao tends to have that effect on opponents to engage is to walk willingly into the fastest hands in boxing , which , by the end of the sixth round , had swollen mosley s face in round 10 , mosley registered his own knockdown , which appeared on replay more like a push this actually qualified as action mosley spent much of the final two rounds pedaling backward like an nfl cornerback ultimately , the event again begged an answer to boxing s most important question when , if ever , will pacquiao and floyd mayweather jr fight \? i do n't care , pacquiao said i'm satisfied with what i 've done in boxing i want to fight mayweather because the people want it afterward , mosley agreed he had taken too few risks he said he had never planned to be aggressive he also said a blood blister opened on his foot pacquiao said his legs had tightened in the fourth round , which he described as a problem throughout training camp this hampered his movement and leverage given that , his trainer , freddie roach , labeled his performance as gutsy mosley also tossed compliments at his opponent , while declining to address his thoughts on retirement i just fought the best fighter in the world , he said he has power , exceptional power , that i 've never been hit with before before the action , pacquiao greeted senator harry reid and the entrepreneur steve wynn in his dressing room , multitasking right up until the fight he entered to the theme song from rocky before an audience of 16 , 412 , which included tyrese , jamie foxx and paris hilton mosley sauntered in first , to ll cool j s hit song mama said knock you out despite the inaction early , pacquiao kept stalking , kept charging , kept chasing mosley around the ring late in the third round , he blitzed mosley , landing a right hand , then a straight left that dropped mosley to the canvas the crowd , sensing a knockout , rose to its feet mosley looked dazed afterward , and stumbled back to his corner , limping at the start of the fourth round , mosley appeared confused pacquiao continued his assault , overwhelming his older , slower opponent with typical speed and precision , when possible at least mosley s corner implored him to go forward , but he seemed simply overmatched earlier saturday , pacquiao was involved in a fender bender , as first reported by tmz and confirmed later by his camp those close to him described the accident as minor and pacquiao as unharmed but pacquiao is extremely habitual by nature he fights on the same days , follows the same routines and makes no secret of his superstitions even a missed meal makes him grumpy thus the question lingered would this disruption , however minor , affect his mindset \? \( no \) in recent months , pacquiao served in congress in the philippines , collaborated with the singersongwriter dan hill on seven versions of hill s sometimes when we touch , visited washington for the first time and met president barack obama basically , a normal month on saturday , he returned to what he does best , annihilating foes inside a boxing ring , perhaps better than any current fighter on the planet for this fight , pacquiao received 20 million guaranteed mosley , 5 million the promotion lacked the usual , often manufactured , boxing animosity , as if the fighters were competing to win dual mr congeniality awards on friday , after pacquiao weighed in at 145 pounds and mosley tipped the scale at 147 , they even hugged their boxing bromance stood in stark contrast to the action expected in the ring in pacquiao s last fight , a battering of antonio margarito last november , he threw more than 1 , 000 punches , according to compubox in four of his last five fights , pacquiao bludgeoned oscar de la hoya , ricky hatton , joshua clottey and margarito , none of whom have fought since on wednesday , pacquiao s promoter , bob arum of top rank boxing , noted that margarito had been told by a number of doctors he will never be able to fight again , a result of the stillnothealed orbital bone pacquiao had fractured look at the careers he ended , arum said will mosley be next in line \? he did not say but saturday marked his third straight lackluster fight he started his career with 38 wins his record since 8711 news from pacquiao s training camp helped make mosley an underdog in the 7 1 to 9 1 range roach declared the camp pacquiao s best ever roach said pacquiao had never been in better shape early into fight week , word leaked that pacquiao planned to fight juan manuel marquez for the third time in his next contest yet afterward , arum said , nobody is going to beat this guy so why not put him against mayweather , the other candidate for best boxer on the planet \?

washington president obama , in wideranging remarks at the national prayer breakfast , said thursday that he was praying for the violence in the middle east to end , and separately called on the country to move beyond polarizing debate to remember that few people are right all of the time mr obama told an audience of lawmakers , religious leaders and heads of state \( from equatorial guinea and macedonia \) that in the middle of strife , it is important to go back to the scriptures to remind ourselves that none of us have the answer mr obama spoke for around 15 minutes about his upbringing , which he said was not religious his father , he recounted , was a nonbeliever , and he said his mom , whose parents were baptists and methodists , grew up with a certain skepticism she only took me to church at easter and christmas sometimes , mr obama said still , mr obama said his mother nagged me consistently about the homespun values of her kansas upbringing , and credited her with helping him to understand the equal worth of all men and all women american presidents make it a practice of attending the national prayer breakfast , a hodgepodge mix of republicans and democrats and , in the case thursday , one hollywood film producer , randall wallace , who gave the featured speech mr wallace said he was a descendant of william wallace , the 13thcentury scottish freedom fighter on whom the movie braveheart was based mr wallace opened with a clip of the actor mel gibson playing the title character , his face painted and kiltwearing legs exposed they may take our lives , but they will never take our freedom ! ! ! braveheart roars the audience clapped weakly an introduction like this sort of infuses me with hollywood glamor , mr wallace said before starting a story about meeting ms universe and putting on his sunglasses and saying , hi , i m randall wallace mr wallace told stories from his childhood , including a convoluted one about his grandfather , who he said was one of only two white men working with black men , when the other white man , a supervisor , said that he was used to calling the black workers sob s , and that mr wallace s grandfather shouldn t get upset if he mistakenly called him an sob sometimes mr wallace s grandfather replied something about not getting upset if he hit the guy in the face with something , mr wallace recounted mr obama , sitting next to the lectern where mr wallace was speaking , looked down at the table with a slight smile mr wallace also talked about having a pianoplaying pig named pigerace when he was done , it was time for mr obama s remarks he thanked randall for all your wonderful stories and powerful prayers
only one republican represents new york city in congress , and even in his 13th congressional district , which includes staten island and a small southwest corner of brooklyn , it s a highwire act you can talk all you want about the need to cut federal spending and taxes when you 're in the staten island part of the district , but try that after crossing the verrazano bridge , and you 're going to need some protection that republican is michael grimm , one of the freshmen elected in last november s wave , and he learned that lesson rather painfully on wednesday night in a junior high school auditorium in the dyker heights section of the borough it was his first town hall meeting in brooklyn , and it came less than two weeks after he voted for the ravaging new house republican budget that plan would essentially privatize medicare , slash medicaid and many other federal programs that are very popular in new york , and further cut taxes for the rich the crowd lay in wait for him with sharpened reports from the congressional budget office , incendiary printouts from liberal blogs , and even a few lethal rolledup newspapers with articles about the house plan mr grimm was left standing , but only after 90 minutes of highdecibel debate , during which a school security guard had to threaten to remove several citizens vibrating with anger about medicare it began when he asked the crowd of about 100 people whether they believed the nation faced a debt crisis a woman near the front row responded that the nation faced a revenue crisis someone else shouted out that taxes were too low , and a third person shouted that it was all president george w bush s fault for cutting taxes on the rich there was a big round of applause , and with that the evening became a battle of statistics and worldviews , in perhaps the only section of the city divided enough to match the national debate adjust medicare , do n't kill it ! shouted one woman the program just is n't sustainable , mr grimm said , trying to control his meeting that s a flatout lie , said a man in a communications workers of america shirt around the country , republican lawmakers on recess have encountered bitter opposition as they meet with constituents infuriated at their medicare vote republicans have complained that the town meetings have been targeted by democratic activist groups like moveon it s true , but the criticism is no less legitimate than when members of the tea party swarmed town halls in 2009 at the height of the health care debate many of mr grimm s critics at the brooklyn meeting were wearing union shirts , or reading from printouts one woman who almost got thrown out for shouting is a few said in interviews that they lived in more affluent sections of the borough but just as many appeared to be mr grimm s constituents , and said they had grave concerns about his vote to cut the safety net while benefiting the rich if this whole budget is about trying to get out of debt , asked one woman , then why are we still providing tax cuts to the people who need it less \? mr grimm responded in a depressingly familiar way what this debate has turned into is class warfare let s be honest about it , he said lower taxes across the board would increase government revenue , he maintained , in the face of loud catcalls from those who pointed out that that economic theory has long since been discredited according to one show of hands , nearly half the audience voted for mr grimm , and while they occasionally applauded , they were far quieter than the critics none stood up to support his vote on medicare at his staten island meeting the next night , to accuse him of trying to kill grandma mr grimm , who won election by only three percentage points in 2010 \( and who lost the brooklyn section \) may find his vote makes the task quite a bit harder in 2012
on wednesday at 10 pm , hbo will show the final episode of its 24 7 series on the penguins and capitals road to the winter classic , and hockey fans will be watching as they have the previous three episodes of this superb , engrossing documentary this episode will be about the new year s night outdoor game , and many at heinz field in pittsburgh last saturday were already saying they couldn t wait to see it but when it is over , a lot of fans will be very sad to see it go  but none will be sadder than the coaches and players , as dan bylsma , the penguins coach , told reporters moments after the outdoor game ended bylsma s halting description of his feelings at seeing the bittersweet end of the monthlong 24 7 experience was hard to forget , and may give a preview of some of what we may be seeing in the episode i feel a little let down seeing these guys go , he said our guys are shaking hands and saying goodbye to the hbo crew , because we feel like we re sending a player down but we ll have to do our best to get back to normalcy , which is 41 games or 42 games left in our hockey season we ve got a lot of work to do it was a great experience i think there s a lot of awesome things about it i guess i ll be all right with not having a mic pasted right here all day every day bruce boudreau , the capitals coach , was in a more ebullient mood after the outdoor game but he too seemed sorry to see the experience end we kind of like them now , boudreau said , referring to the hbo crew i mean , we didn t like them much at the beginning of the month , but i think everything s worked out the resumption of the regularseason schedule for the capitals and the penguins seems almost like an anticlimax , or perhaps more accurately , like something that cannot begin until this last episode unfolds on jan 4 , the capitals lost to tampa bay , 10 , in overtime , a fascinating matchup of alex ovechkin versus steven stamkos , but it s hard for fans to get worked up with the cinematic version of the new year s game still unseen on the nhl live ! radio show monday , boudreau described what it was like to have the hbo crew with him and his team around the clock they were understanding that they are in every nook and cranny and bugging us when we didn t want to get bugged , boudreau said but they were so professional about it and so polite that it made you want them to have all access if they had come in and were rude or pushy i m sure the guys would have pushed back , but that wasn t the case the result of that kind of access , in one instance , was viewers hearing boudreau tell his team that the key to playing against evgeni malkin is to bump him so that he will retaliate with a silly penalty sure enough , that is exactly what malkin did in the dec 23 game between the teams and it is hard to believe that malkin will ever make the same mistake again , now that the entire hockey world has seen it
when colin quinn long story short opened at the helen hayes theater in november , producers presented mr quinn and the show s director , jerry seinfeld , with a hirschfeld caricature of the two for most of the 20th century , nothing defined opening night on broadway like an al hirschfeld drawing of the production , and this one had the familiar swooping line and hirschfeld signature but it was not done by al hirschfeld , who died in 2003 at age 99 if it were 20 years ago , i would have hired al hirschfeld , said the show s lead producer , eva price i wanted something iconic and 'old broadway' her online search for a younger that is to say , living version of al hirschfeld had turned up a web site for a matt hirschfeld , whose site proclaims him next in line , a nonetoosubtle reference to the line king , the 1996 documentary about al hirschfeld i loved the fact he was related to al , ms price said i could n't get the real al hirschfeld , so i wanted something reminiscent , something al would have drawn if he were still around \( the elder mr hirschfeld had even drawn mr seinfeld , several hairstyles ago \) but while matt hirschfeld s name is , for him , money in the bank , whether the two hirschfelds are actually related remains a puzzle , composed , in part , of a mother s ambition , an immigrant s destination card and a legendary illustrator s professed bafflement at a claim of kinship matt says that his paternal grandfather , richard hirschfeld , was a cousin of al hirschfeld that would make al matt s second cousin twice removed al s gallery representative for the last 40 years , margo feiden , said , however , that al hirschfeld was never convinced al had no problem with this kid , it was only the mother s claim that they were related , ms feiden said he used to call them 'these meshuganah people who keep insisting they 're related to me' al s widow and the archivist of his foundation both said they did not know of any evidence that settled the claim of a blood tie matt said the only shred of proof he had of being related to al was an immigration document of his greatgrandfather s stating that his destination was sarah street in st louis , which was an early address of al s the two illustrators never met , although they almost did in 1997 , al visited st louis for a screening of the line king , and got together with some of his local relations i had a hockey game that day , matt recalled my mom showed him one of my drawings it was matt hirschfeld s mother , adrienne hirschfeld , who brought matt to the attention of the new york times after a recent article on the old barber chair al sat in while drawing matt was , in fact , reluctant at first to be interviewed , even though his web site promotes his caricatures that incorporate various elements in style of al hirschfeld broadway has no shortage of illustrators , some of whom wear their hirschfeld influence proudly while matt does not claim to be al incarnate , if the connection gives a push to his fledgling career as an illustrator of entertainers , he will take it after al passed away , people kept asking me , 'are you going to carry on the name \? ' he said but taking that on is asking for a lot to have the last name and become a caricaturist is a lot to live up to he said he has never used a pen and ink , but rather does his drawings with a computer mouse on a macintosh desktop there s a scene in 'the line king' when al is on a computer and he says that it would take another lifetime to learn how to use the computer to do what he does that s when my eyes lit up , and i thought it 'd be interesting to do just that he drew the whole 20th century , and i want to draw a chunk of the 21st matt hirschfeld grew up in st louis , where al lived before moving at age 10 to new york matt began drawing at an early age and was constantly exposed to al s drawings and to reminders from relatives that he had the hirschfeld art gene after al s death , matt began settling into something akin to his famous lastnamesake s style matt has sold illustrations of cast members for films including crash and no country for old men , but he has yet to win over those closest to al i think he is just copying al hirschfeld and he wants to ride al s coattails , said al s last wife , louise hirschfeld cullman i do n't even think he s talented enough to copy al i looked at his web site , and his work is a second or thirdrate copy and the archivist of the al hirschfeld foundation , david leopold , said that matt hirschfeld was just trying to be al hirschfeld when you list yourself as 'matt hirschfeld next in line , ' you 're really trying to trade on the name , said mr leopold , who added that he had no reason to doubt matt s claim that he was related he s getting work from people who think they 're getting a hirschfeld , only it s not an al hirschfeld matt dismissed the critics people who say , 'he s no al hirschfeld and he never will be he s just cashing in on the name , ' they 're entitled to be wrong , he said i'm not trying to draw like him , line for line , but his work inspired me and i 've seen thousands of characters that he s done he added in the end , it s my own work , my own vision , and i think al would have liked it matt recently moved to los angeles , where he works as a graphic artist for an insurance agency , and draws at home in the evenings matt has adapted some of al s drawing techniques for the modern era al often made sketches from live performances and used photographs to draw a conventional pencil sketch , followed by a penandink version with bolder , more exaggerated lines on top of the pencil sketch , which was then erased matt typically makes a pencil sketch from photographs , scans it into the computer and opens it with the adobe illustrator program he uses the mouse to make penlike lines and then deletes the underlying handdrawn sketch it helped that i had a digital background , so i was not competing with pen and ink , he said there are other differences while matt s drawings , like al s , are signed with just the last name , matt writes in a brush script , not in al s elongated printing hand matt does not draw in a barber chair , but rather in a 25 office chair bought on craigslist and matt said he tries to avoid drawing subjects al has drawn he s already done them , and i want to move on to today s actors he has made some exceptions , though not just mr seinfeld , but geoffrey rush , marlon brando , daniel daylewis , leonardo dicaprio matt s sketch of mr dicaprio was given to the actor by a mutual friend , and mr dicaprio sent him a thankyou note , matt said matt hirschfeld has also resisted the impulse to hide a nina in his drawings , save for once when he drew the nina character in the black swan played by natalie portman , to try to sell it to the film s production company they did not buy it as for a barber chair , matt said , i'm interested in getting one , to see what it s like this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photos the cast of seinfeld \( jason alexander , julia louisdreyfus , jerry seinfeld and michael richards \) as drawn by al hirschfeld , right \( photograph by al hirschfeld courtesy of the margo feiden galleries matt hirschfeld \) matt hirschfeld , left , was hired to do a caricature for long story short , starring colin quinn and directed by mr seinfeld matt and al hirschfelds' takes on the rolling stones appear on city room nytimescom cityroom \( photograph by matt hirschfeld \)
the nhl trade deadline is certainly not what it used to be many general managers have begun to see the wisdom of making deals when they re not under the gun of filing paperwork by 3 00 pm after 31 trades were made at the deadline a year ago , only 16 were finalized on monday there just weren t many players in play , chicago blackhawks general manager stan bowman said early monday evening his only deal was acquiring defenseman chris campoli from ottawa for depth player ryan potulny and a secondround pick we were looking to do some things , said bowman , but it takes two to make a deal there were other reasons for the relative inactivity in the final hours only five teams were considered sellers who were trading for the future , rather than eying this year s playoff race edmonton , ottawa , the islanders , colorado and florida a handful of important acquisitions were made in the weeks leading up to the deadline , such as the bruins trade for toppair defenseman tomas kaberle and the flyers deal for clutch scoring forward kris versteeg none of the trades on monday could be considered blockbusters , and likely only two have the potential to significantly impact the playoffs a brief analysis washington acquired jason arnott from new jersey for david steckel and a second round draft pick arnott waived his notrade clause to join the contending capitals , while new jersey general manager lou lamoriello maximized his aging center s value by obtaining a good young forward in steckel and a secondround pick lamoriello , who acquired arnott from nashville last summer for a secondrounder , said on monday that his surging team should not see a dropoff in play after the trade he is very high on steckel he leads the league in faceoffs and has done so the last couple of years , lamoriello told rich chere of the starledger we go way back with him we interviewed him when he was a junior we certainly knew of him in college we know what he can and does bring we certainly think he has something to offer in all situations , especially when a game is on the line he s played a lot of minutes on a team that really has some high offensive players we felt that in order for us to trade jason arnott , we had to bring a player into our lineup that would not miss a beat in what our team can bring and the type of team we have for washington general manager george mcphee , this is a lowrisk move to get the secondline center with size , skill and tenacity that his team needs arnott won a stanley cup in his first tenure with the devils the capitals have underachieved in the playoffs in the brief alex ovechkin era arnott s leadership should help mcphee also added a muchneeded offensive defenseman , trading a thirdround pick and prospect jake hauswirth to florida for dennis wideman los angeles acquired dustin penner from edmonton for a firstround pick , conditional pick and colton teubert the kings paid a hefty price for a topsix forward with scoring ability , but consider it a victory that they did so without sacrificing top prospect brayden schenn penner , who becomes the kings thirdhighest paid player at 4 millionplus with one full year remaining on his contract , had 21 goals and 39 points in 62 games with the oilers this season los angeles general manager dean lombardi believed his team deserved one major piece to be competitive down the stretch the kings are in a tight race for one of the final playoff berths in the western conference and are 712 in their last 10 games it looks like we ve grown , we ve learned from our mistakes and this is the time when you look at your team and say , you know , they deserve some help and strength in our locker room to make us a better team , lombardi said after the deadline i just felt there was a little more urgency because of what the players had done to get us to this point in other trades of note monday , the canucks traded draft picks and prospects for a pair of grinding forwards chris higgins from florida and maxim lapierre from anaheim columbus traded original blue jackets defenseman rostislav klesla to phoenix for scottie upshall and semi lepisto and carolina added defenseman bryan allen in a deal with the panthers for sergei samsonov
federal regulators on friday cited spiderman turn off the dark for three serious workplace safety violations , though the proposed fine of 12 , 600 is unlikely to faze a production that has already run through 65 million the citations stem from four instances last year in which cast members of the broadway musical were hurt , including one in which an actor , christopher tierney , sustained broken ribs and a hairline skull fracture , among other injuries , when he plunged , untethered , from a platform on stage the citations , from the occupational safety and health administration , were issued to the production company for the show , 8 legged productions llc it has the right to challenge them last month , state officials cited the show , playing at the foxwoods theater , for two workplace safety violations that did not carry fines in a statement , the federal agency said the employees had been exposed to the hazards of falls or being struck during flying routines because of improperly adjusted or unsecured safety harnesses additionally , the agency found that unguarded openside floors lacked fall protection , and that not enough had been done to shield employees from being struck by moving overhead rigging components osha issues serious citations when , according to its review , lapses have led to hazards carrying a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result rick miramontez , a spokesman for the production , which has added multiple procedures to avoid any reoccurrence of injuries , said the show remains in compliance with all government agencies and continues to adhere to all safety protocols spiderman has been troubled by production issues that have led its producers to postpone its opening five times it is now scheduled to open on march 15 , though staff members have acknowledged that that date may also be in jeopardy  some of the delays have been related to the technical difficulty of the flying sequences being tried in the theater none of the injuries occurred during flights in which cast members swing out over the audience
cleveland the times for early batting practice were highlighted in yellow on the ' pregame schedule wednesday afternoon from 4 45 to 5 30 , the visitors could use the indoor batting cage at drizzly progressive field carl crawford was ready , and you got the feeling the seconds were ticking away in his brain crawford , the red sox' new 142 million left fielder , flipped aimlessly through a magazine until about 4 40 , when he strode to his locker , grabbed a bat and went to work he returned 75 minutes later , drenched in sweat just focusing on trying to hit the ball , square it up , crawford said you 've just got to keep things as simple as possible do n't want to think about it too much the red sox , heavy favorites to win the american league east , would rather not think about their first five games they have lost them all , three to the rangers in texas and the first two here against the , including when the yankees visit boston this weekend , yawkey way could be frothing i 'll be excited friday , said first baseman adrian gonzalez , who has never played at fenway park until then , i have to worry about winning a game in cleveland crawford and gonzalez were the centerpiece additions of a busy winter for the red sox crawford was 2 for 15 until wednesday , when he singled twice , stole two bases , made a leaping catch in left field and scored in the seventh on gonzalez s first home run with more such performances , the red sox should be fine for now , they are frustrated this game will humble you in a hurry , and it s doing it to us right now , manager terry francona said so we 've got to start acting like we 're a good team we 've got to find a way to win five games is an absurdly small sample size , the equivalent of the second quarter on opening week of an nfl season and seven of the eight playoff teams from last season lost five in a row at some point then again , only one team in the wildcard era , the 1995 cincinnati reds , has reached the postseason after starting 05 no team has won the world series after starting with so many losses the red sox have an 832 earned run average and a none of their starters have met the minimum requirements for a quality start \( six innings , three earned runs \)  i feel like i'm one of the sole reasons we 're not winning , youkilis said i 've got to go out and play a lot better for my teammates and the fans of boston playing third base with the bases loaded and no outs in the sixth inning , youkilis nearly had michael brantley sliced a low liner , and youkilis said he thought about dropping the ball on purpose and trying for a triple play but when the ball tailed away from him , he tried to catch it and could not hang on youkilis scrambled to step on third for an out , then fired home to catcher jason varitek as travis buck raced to the plate the problem was , youkilis removed the force when he stepped on the base , and varitek needed to tag buck he did not , and buck scored to put cleveland ahead , 42 it s probably the weirdest play i 've ever been a part of , varitek said i'm just trying to learn what i could have done different , besides obviously tagging him but i did n't actually see the play varitek said he thought youkilis was behind the base when he threw home , and he was not sure if buck screened him gonzalez was yelling from first , but varitek did not hear him in any case , the red sox went from confusion to dejection moments later , when asdrubal cabrera drilled a threerun homer off dan wheeler to break the game open we 've had a lot of different things happen , varitek said this team s a lot better than this , and will be better  francona said it was critical to keep a consistent personality , to project calm to the clubhouse he has made one intriguing lineup move , dropping crawford to seventh on sunday against a lefthander , matt harrison of texas francona said crawford seemed to be trying too hard , and he may hit him seventh again , depending on his swing crawford , who had not hit lower than third since 2003 , said the change did not bother him he said he simply had to keep working grinding , as the players say and eventually he would be the same player who made four allstar teams for the rays the rest of the red sox have track records , too , and most are young enough to still live up to them he has no choice anymore , but crawford said he trusted his new teammates you know what you 're in the room with , crawford said you know what you have here you know what kind of guys are around , and how they are that excites you you know at some point we 're going to get out of this funk and get it going

referring to a character from the animated movie cars i say , yes , yes , my son , and kiss him absentmindedly on his head i wonder , is the era of the sheriff over \? i go back out to my sentry post and decide to take refuge in the koran but i forget the opening section , the fatiha , with its prayers for god s guidance i stumble over the lines , jumbling their order i think of writing , and feel for my pencil in my coat pocket i do n't have any paper other than my address book , so i open it in the dark , wanting to write down anything suddenly , bullets ricochet all around me i flatten myself on the ground i wait to hear the helicopter again before i return inside to reassure my family and recharge my energy with haroun s enthusiasm i think of myself as the protagonist of paul auster s man in the dark , who describes his situation in this way i am alone in the dark , turning the world around in my head i grab the iron rod to defend my home and my dream on saturday morning we venture into the street to find our neighborhood filled with unfamiliar faces the shopping center near my home has been looted i go with my wife and son to a relative s house to coordinate our neighborhood security with sticks and stones , we take control of the neighborhood we spend that night shooing away strangers and strange cars in the morning we roam the city looking for bread and milk for our children there is no milk to be found gradually , city residents become used to the state of emergency and the curfew , and begin to enjoy the free time they now have , especially since they are able to speak freely , able to openly curse and ridicule mr ben ali and his corrupt family on monday we are told that a new unity government has formed when tunisians see that some members of the old regime have been named to cabinet posts , there is a new wave of disturbances , and people start saying that the revolution has been stolen from them on tuesday , young people again take to the streets , demanding the dissolution of mr ben ali s party , the democratic constitutional rally party , which has ruled tunisia since independence in 1956 others argue that this risks being a repeat of the purges of members of saddam hussein s baath party in iraq , which contributed to the insurgency there while i agree that it may be impossible to dissolve the party without sending the country into chaos , i think we have no choice but to try there are also demonstrations at the offices of the largest opposition group over its complicity with the old regime in the new government by the end of the day , and nobody knows what will come next as for myself , i feel an overwhelming happiness that i will now be able to write freely a year and a half ago , one of my novels , which describes life under oppression , was performed as a play at a cultural center here those of us involved were monitored constantly by the police none of the journalists in attendance wrote reviews that is why i support the revolution and , like so many of the young people , worry that it will be stolen from us by the traitors , thieves and killers who have ruled us for far too long
armed commandeered a fuel tanker off the west african nation of benin on wednesday and took its 23 crew members hostage , an international piracy monitoring group reported the hijacking was the latest in a series of increasingly brazen assaults on commercial shipping in a coastal region of africa that had been considered relatively safe until this year the attack on the tanker , a cyprusflagged vessel laden with oil , came as it was trying to transfer some of its cargo to a norwegianflagged vessel , according to the monitoring group , the in london it said the pirates also boarded the second vessel , but that ship s crew members locked themselves in the engine room , and the pirates left the maritime bureau said the confrontations took place in the gulf of guinea , about 70 miles from cotonou , the commercial capital of benin the bureau did not identify either ship by name serghios serghiou , the director of the department of merchant shipping in cyprus , identified the vessel as the mattheos i , which had a filipino crew with spanish , peruvian and ukrainian officers , the associated press reported it quoted him as saying , the ship sent out the initial security alert , but unfortunately , we have n't been able to communicate with the ship cyrus mody , manager of the international maritime bureau , said in a telephone interview that it had recorded 19 pirate attacks on shipping this year in the gulf of guinea , compared with none in 2010 all of the targets have been tankers carrying fuel , which the pirates are able to sell on the black market while hijackings in the region still pale in comparison with the piracy scourge off somalia , on the other side of the continent , the attacks have alarmed shippers and insurers last month , lloyd s market association , a group of insurers in london , added the coastal waters off benin and part of nigeria to a highrisk category that also includes somalia s coast mr mody attributed the rise in piracy in the gulf of guinea to a crackdown on fuel thieves in nigeria , a leading oil exporter he said the effort had forced the thieves to move to neighboring benin , whose government has little ability to police its coast we believe there s a high probability of an extension of nigerian pirates moving away from their own playground , he said although the hostages taken in these attacks have generally been released within 72 hours and none have been killed , mr mody said the pirates were not gentle with captives these instances are very short , very fast and quite violent rifle butts to the head , lashing with cables , that sort of violence , he said michael g frodl , the founder and head of , a washingtonbased risks consultancy that advises maritime industry interests , said the rise in gulf of guinea piracy also reflected a general increase in economic misery , as well as the role model created by successful somali pirate groups , who have been able to exact millions of dollars in ransoms from shippers in somalia , mr frodl said , pirates can act with far greater impunity because there is basically no government in that country the one thing that s going to hold back the development of a ransom model in western africa is the fact that these coastal countries still have law and order , and it s going to be hard to hold on to a ship for more than a few days , he said
rising to speak to the senate on dec 4 , 1861 , the third day of the congressional session , henry wilson of massachusetts brandished a report on the sordid conditions in the washington jail and , in particular , on 60 africanamerican prisoners held within it wilson had been to the jail to witness the stunning scene of degradation and inhumanity male and female prisoners were poorly clothed and fed , he said , crowded into a crumbling building and suffering from myriad diseases most were slaves brought by our armies into the city , having run away from disloyal masters or sent to the jail by their owners for safekeeping some were free blacks unjustly imprisoned under antiquated black codes wilson wanted them all released immediately , and he proposed a resolution ordering the district of columbia marshal to do just that wilson s speech marked the beginning of an intense debate about the future of slavery and the law in the national capital as he spoke , washington remained a bastion of slaveholders power local laws not only sanctioned slavery but restricted the lives and livelihoods of free african americans as well but conditions were changing remarkably rapidly when the congressional session ended six months later , slavery was dead and so were the racially discriminatory black codes moreover , in making policy toward the capital , republican politicians had come to an important conclusion the end of slavery would mean little if african americans were not accorded the same civil rights as whites as congress reconvened in december 1861 , republican legislators were poised to move against slavery in two ways first , they would use congress s wartime power to expand opportunities for confiscation of human property and to demand that military officers protect fugitives coming into their lines second , though , they would take action against slavery in the few places where it had direct control one of those places was the district of columbia in its summer session , congress had reorganized the city s police force , hoping to purge it of confederate loyalists but a separate county constable and local magistrate system remained in place , and that system rewarded the arrest of african americans according to the law , every negro and mulatto found residing in the city who could not establish his or her title to freedom would be jailed as absconding slaves yet change was at hand proslavery congressmen , primarily southerners , had for decades stood fast against encroachments on slavery in the capital most of those men were gone now , and an antislavery party was at the helm fugitive slaves forced the issue further , absconding from farms and plantations in maryland and virginia and offering aid to the union forces stationed on the outskirts of the capital most military officials around washington welcomed their assistance and promised wages to the escapees they hired the emerging relationship between union forces and escaped slaves was bolstered by the federal confiscation act of aug 6 , 1861 , which protected slaves who made their way into union lines and claimed that their owners would force them to labor for the confederacy such slave owners , the law held , no longer had any claim none of this seemed to matter to the capital s constables and magistrates they continued to regularly arrest men , women and children on suspicion of being fugitives , and they did so in workplaces , in the market and on the city s streets by october , a few northern newspapers were reporting that federal law was not being enforced in the shadow of the capitol , and that runaways from virginia at least one of them the property of a confederate officer were held without charges in washington s infamous jail northerners knew well about the washington jail abolitionists had long decried the jail and washington s entire law enforcement system as examples of slaveholders grip on the federal government an 1836 broadside called the capital city the slave market of america and attacked the jail as a seat of injustice , where free blacks were sold into slavery and slaves , unclaimed by their owners , might languish for months or years and this was the will of the federal government , abolitionists had pointed out the treasury department paid for the local courts and the jail , while the official at the head of the system , the district of columbia marshal , was a federal appointee as william lloyd garrison put it in september 1861 , the city itself was an ancient and famous slavepen the messages at the heart of the abolitionist indictment of the washington jail were threefold slavery was morally wrong , all free people had a right to equal treatment before the law , and the government should stand for freedom and equality , not slavery and oppression the senators who joined wilson in demanding reform of local law enforcement hit exactly these points senator john hale of new hampshire offered a broad indictment of the district s justice system no matter how long a man has lived here , no matter how correct a life he has led , no matter how exemplary he may be in all the walks of life , if his complexion was dark , he was liable to be at once arrested and carried to jail , and kept in confinement congress had a duty , hale declared , to look into the administration of justice in this district , and to see to it that those who have been ground to the earth heretofore may not be ground still more under your auspices to expunge the black code from the statutebook , charles sumner of massachusetts added , is to expunge slavery itself in coming weeks , radical republican congressmen would offer a raft of proposals aimed at legal reform in the capital , including resolutions demanding accountability from the district marshal \( president lincoln s good friend ward hill lamon \) and bills to abolish both slavery and the black code their campaign received support from a group of northern newspapermen who , sensing a good story , visited the jail and reported to the public frank leslie s illustrated weekly , whose politics were decidedly moderate on issues of race and slavery , sent an artist whose powerful sketches were printed as a twopage spread , accompanied by an endorsement of their accuracy signed by senator wilson and others the dramatic pictures , the editors told readers , speak with a powerful although silent truth and rhetoric as the debate continued that winter , congress subordinated the question of civil rights for free blacks to the issue of slavery itself this made sense , since slavery needed to end before civil equality could be established but wilson and his colleagues did not forget where the debate had begun with a legal code that created and enforced african americans inferiority immediately after president lincoln signed the district of columbia emancipation act on april 16 , 1862 , ending slavery in the district , wilson once again pushed beyond freedom to embrace equal rights a new law , proposed by wilson and signed by the president on may 22 , 1862 , established a system of public schools for black children in the capital and provided , finally , that all persons of color shall be subject and amenable to the same laws and ordinances to which free white persons are the republicans of the 37th congress recognized something important freedom would be meaningless if african americans were denied the same civil rights as whites already enjoyed in this way the debate about abolition and civil rights in washington during 1861 and 1862 foreshadowed the much betterknown reconstruction debate on the same topic immediately after the war , the governments of most southern states hoped for abolition without civil rights they ratified the 13th amendment , which abolished slavery , but immediately passed racially discriminatory black codes it was , in large part , congressional republicans rejection of those terms their conviction that freedom was not enough that provoked their break with president andrew johnson and passage of the first federal first civil rights law the civil rights act of 1866 follow

the reporter in disguise has largely faded from mainstream american journalism but the tactic is alive and well in the hands of passionate partisans as their pursuit of the gotcha moment has become part of the cost of life in the public eye , one question is how willing politicians will be to advance their agendas on the backs of these muckrakers 20 in just the last month , surreptitiously recorded conversations have embarrassed npr and , organizations long under assault from conservatives , as well as gov of wisconsin , a republican and target of the political left for his antiunion stance the latest episode came this week , when the conservative provocateur released a video that included an npr fundraiser who makes disparaging remarks about the this led to the resignation of the radio network s chief executive , vivian schiller so far , politicians have been quick to celebrate the ends even as they tiptoe around the question of whether the means are appropriate senator jim demint , republican of south carolina , has limited his comments to calling for an end to federal financing for npr representative eric cantor of virginia , the republican majority leader , issued a statement saying , this video clearly highlights the fact that public broadcasting does n't need taxpayer funding to thrive representative doug lamborn , republican of colorado , also cited the o'keefe video specifically in talking to the daily caller about cutting funding for public broadcasting their arrogance and condescension , he said , is just amazing none of the three mentioned mr o'keefe by name when asked about mr o'keefe s tactics , a spokeswoman for mr cantor was circumspect congressman cantor has been working to find ways to cut spending so that people can go back to work political strategists express worry that this sort activity has been creeping into campaigns for some time now but the fact that they can so often have a political benefit leaves many torn i find the whole thing bordering on unsavory on both sides , said ari fleischer , a white house press secretary under president george w bush as much as i love it when liberal hypocrisy is exposed , he added , do we really want to get to the point where it becomes standard fare especially in political campaigns for opponents to engage in sting operations \? defensible or not , use of the tactics seems to be growing in the recent planned parenthood incident , the organization fired a clinic manager after an antiabortion group secretly videotaped her giving advice on how to get medical care for underage prostitutes , prompting renewed cries from social conservatives to eliminate the organization s federal funding in wisconsin , a liberal blogger prankcalled the governor posing as david koch , the conservative donor and philanthropist the governor compared his efforts to weaken the collective bargaining rights of public workers to president ronald reagan s firing of air traffic controllers in 1981 , a move seen by many as a watershed moment in the weakening of organized labor democrats pounced , seeing an opportunity to draw focus to what they said were the governor s intentions all along to break public employee unions and those were just in the last month mr o'keefe , who first gained notice for secretly videotaping his exchanges with workers for the community organizing group acorn who appeared to advise him how to avoid prosecution for a variety of unsavory activities like child prostitution , pleaded guilty last year in connection with entering the new orleans office of senator under false pretenses mr o'keefe claimed ms landrieu had been ignoring constituents' phone calls during the health care debate conservative politicians pointedly distanced themselves from mr o'keefe after that incident , with some saying that a line had been crossed despite their misleading methods , such pranks do not seem to taint the politicians who benefit from them i do find it a little difficult to draw a link because it s so hard to hold one person accountable for behavior with which they had no relationship at all except that they kind of agree , said christopher c hull , who teaches politics at georgetown university by and large , american news organizations are wary of the toll stunts like mr o'keefe s can take on their credibility some attempts by mainstream media outlets to mask their reporters' identities , in fact , have caused a backlash one of the most significant examples was the case involving abc news and food lion , in which the supermarket chain sued the network , claiming fraud and trespassing producers for the program primetime live lied on job applications and obtained jobs in the back rooms of food lion stores , where they recorded employees engaging in unsanitary and dangerous practices like bleaching spoiled meat as the case made its way through the courts , the pew research center for the people the press asked in a 1997 poll whether people thought it was acceptable for reporters to use potentially deceptive tactics like hidden cameras large majorities said no the chicago suntimes found itself snubbed by the board in the 1970s after it set up a sting operation at the mirage bar , where they caught city inspectors accepting bribes tom rosenstiel , director of pew s project for excellence in journalism , said that newspapers subsequently pulled back from such techniques because , he said , it was hard to try and suggest you 're telling the truth when you 're lying
boston the second round of the stanley cup playoffs is turning out to be as onesided as the first round was close and for the teams that have lost or are in danger of losing in four games , the consequences of being swept could be significant on wednesday , tampa bay completed a surprising sweep of washington , the topseeded team in the eastern conference boston crushed philadelphia here to take a threegamestonone lead and san jose won in overtime and now holds a 30 advantage against detroit only in the vancouvernashville series , which the canucks lead by 31 after winning game 4 , 42 , on thursday in nashville , has each team in a conference semifinal won at least one game this is in contrast to the opening round , whose eight matchups featured four series that went to game 7 and two that went to game 6 though most of the firstround losers packed up for the summer with heads held high even the rangers , dispatched in five games by washington , seemed optimistic about next season the emphatic nature of the results of the secondround series have exposed weaknesses not fully evident earlier exhibit a is the , now ousted two years in a row after winning the conference s regularseason title in four years under coach bruce boudreau , the capitals have won two playoff series \( both against the rangers \) and lost four the first three series defeats came in game 7s , but this year s sweep is seen as embarrassing i am so sorry we let you all down , the washington owner , ted leonsis , wrote on his blog thursday morning the post was titled congratulations to tampa bay and in it leonsis acknowledged that the was clearly the better team and lamented that the capitals were n't resilient even their role players outplayed our highestpaid players , leonsis wrote , a reference not to alex ovechkin , who scored two goals , had two assists and logged an even plus minus mark , but rather to alexander semin , the shy and mercurial wingman semin scored one goal and had an assist against tampa bay , going minus2 among his sins in the lightning series was jumping over the boards at the wrong moment in a scoreless first period of game 3 , causing a toomanymenontheice penalty that wiped out a washington goal the capitals went on to lose , 43 many fans in washington want to see semin traded many want boudreau fired , despite his likeability , because they see him as unable to master the intricacies of defensive hockey in the regular season , boudreau successfully switched the capitals' focus from scoring goals to preventing them , and the team allowed only 197 goals after giving up 233 in 200910 but against tampa bay s highpowered attack , the capitals conceded 16 goals in four games on the eve of game 4 , boudreau was asked about his job security what , is your job on the line \? well then , i do n't know how to answer that , he said stupid question stupid leonsis said in his blog post that he would not act in haste he wrote , the best course of action for us though is to let a few days pass be very analytic about what needs to be improved articulate that plan and then execute upon it such concerns did not arise for one firstround losing coach , lindy ruff of buffalo , who received a contract extension another coach , john tortorella of the rangers , received a contract extension during the regular season , when the rangers were struggling to nail down the final playoff spot in the east for the , coach peter laviolette s job seemed secure , but win or lose , general manager paul holmgren will probably try to acquire a dependable veteran goalie to replace brian boucher and michael leighton , who have stumbled through the postseason last year the two played well through three rounds before leighton fell apart in the stanley cup finals against the blackhawks the rookie sergei bobrovsky has also had trouble this spring , and laviolette s confusion over which goalie to start and when to remove them has not helped in 10 playoff games , the flyers' starter has not finished six times it s not easy for a goalie to come in , but i do n't know who is playing tomorrow , defenseman kimmo timonen said thursday , a sentiment expressed by several flyers bobrovsky , a 22yearold russian who won 28 of his 54 games this season , was expected to start in game 4 it is hard to see what the fallout might be if the are eliminated promptly , though losing three games by one goal , including one in overtime , indicates that they have not been badly outplayed still , the have beaten the red wings in seven of their last eight playoff games in each case by a single goal one consequence of their failure could be the departure of mike modano , a 21year veteran who has been a healthy scratch throughout the series after playing in only one game in the red wings' firstround series against phoenix of course , there still could be game 7s in this round the flyers could come back from three games down to beat the , as they did last year but to do so , they will have to get their goaltending in order , solve boston goalie tim thomas , improve their faceoff performance \( they won only 12 of 55 in game 3 \) and perhaps assign someone to shadow the bruins' david krejci , who has four goals in three games this series if the flyers are unable to salvage something out of this series by winning at least a game before bowing out , they too will face the consequences of a comprehensive secondround defeat
efforts to outlaw fighting in hockey go back decades but though the number of fights in the nhl has dropped significantly in recent years , fighting persists , preserved by the idea that it is a deterrent against cheap shots , a safety valve against more serious mayhem and something that fans like to watch this core belief in the value of fighting may prevent the league s general managers , when they meet this month in florida , from reacting decisively to the latest research findings , including the determination announced wednesday that the longtime enforcer bob probert had chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a degenerative disease of brain tissue associated with repeated concussions probert , who retired in 2002 after a 16year career with the detroit red wings and the chicago blackhawks , died last year at 45 at least three nhl players have sustained concussions this season as a result of fighting , and commissioner gary bettman has acknowledged that concussions from fighting are one reason for a slight uptick in reported brain injuries this year over years past the calgary enforcer raitans ivanans sustained a concussion in an with edmonton s steve mcintyre and is still recovering from postconcussion syndrome edmonton defenseman ladislav smid missed four games with a concussion after being punched by sean avery of the rangers on  derek boogaard , the 6foot7 rangers enforcer , recently resumed skating after sustaining a concussion in a with ottawa s matt carkner , though coach john tortorella said boogaard was still quite a ways away from playing again there is a growing body of evidence , beyond the probert findings , that indicates a correlation between fighting and concussions if you want to reduce concussions in hockey , you should outlaw fighting , said dr paul echlin , a sports medicine physician in london , ontario , and the lead researcher in a study of concussions in junior hockey released last december echlin s study followed two ontario junior teams over 52 games in 200910 , with independent clinicians conducting ingame examinations of players suspected of having concussions they found that of 21 diagnosed concussions , 5 were the result of fights none were selfreported the normal case is that the player ends up in the penalty box and does n't selfreport , echlin said he suffers symptoms that indicate he is neurologically injured , and yet they think it s nothing dr michael stuart of the mayo clinic , the chief medical officer for usa hockey and an expert on head trauma , said he was not surprised that fighting carries an increased risk of concussion you 're punching each other in the face , stuart said the objective of boxing is to cause traumatic brain injury to knock your opponent out so when big , powerful people fight on skates , it s not unexpected that somebody may sustain a concussion dr robert cantu of boston university s center for the study of traumatic encephalopathy , an expert on sportsrelated concussions , said hockey players have sought his advice after sustaining head trauma i have had a number of defensemen , enforcer types , come into my office and ask if they should retire usually late in their careers , said cantu , who studied the damage to probert s brain they 've had probably fewer than 10 concussions , but they 're still having symptoms , or the symptoms lingered longer than they had before cantu said that the enforcers told him that roughly one in four or one in five fights they 'd get stung , the sky would change colors , and they 'd be dazed they 'd go to the penalty box , spend their five minutes , and then go back to the bench and play , he said never , and i mean never , did they tell the trainers that they 'd been clocked they 'd bring it up relative to being hit playing hockey sometimes , but never , never from a fight rob ray , a former nhl enforcer , knows well the signs of concussion even on nights you walk away from fights , you 're scrambly and get headaches , said ray , who had 288 fights in a 15year career i can remember the night stu grimson and i got in a fight in anaheim we both walked away from it thinking we did well , but he missed time and the next day in warmups , i could n't turn left i 'd always fall down ray said that enforcers did not report their concussions because they know they 're too easy to replace yet ray , who said he sustained 10 to 12 concussions and still has days when he loses track of what he s doing , said it would be a big mistake to outlaw fighting you need to have that fear if i hit someone wrong , someone s going to come after me , he said without it , you 'd have far more head shots and hits from behind ray s belief in the effectiveness of fighting as a deterrent is widespread among the hockey community yet despite the threat of a retributive fight , taking aim at injured players persists eric lindros , a star forced to retire early because of at least seven concussions sustained during his career , said players tried to exploit his history of concussions you basically have an x on your back , said lindros , who retired in 2007 players who before would never come at you , once they know about your concussions , they will come at you , and with high elbows
london he admitted that he and his colleagues hacked into people s phones and paid police officers for tips he confessed to lurking in unmarked vans outside people s houses , stealing confidential documents , rifling through celebrity garbage cans and pretending that he was not a journalist pursuing a story but brad the teenage rent boy , propositioning a priest after paul mcmullan , a former deputy features editor at s nowdefunct tabloid , had finished his jawdroppingly brazen remarks at a judicial inquiry on tuesday , it was hard to think of any dubious newsgathering technique he had not confessed to , short of pistolwhipping sources for information nor were the practices he described limited to a select few , mr mcmullan said in an afternoon of testimony at the leveson inquiry , which is investigating media ethics in the wake of the summer s \( indeed , on wednesday , the british police said they had arrested a 17th suspect in investigations into the scandal a 31yearold woman from northern england , who was not identified by name \) in fact , mr mcmullan said , the news of the world s underlings were encouraged by their circulationobsessed bosses to use any means necessary to get material we did all these things for our editors , for and for , mr mcmullan said , referring to two former news of the world editors who , he said , should have had the strength of conviction to say , yes , sometimes you have to stray into black or gray illegal areas' he added they should have been the heroes of journalism , but they are n't they are the scum of journalism for trying to drop me and my colleagues in it mr coulson , who resigned from his job as chief spokesman for prime minister david cameron in january , and mrs brooks , who resigned in july from her job as chief executive of news international , the british newspaper arm of the murdoch empire , have both been arrested on suspicion of phone hacking , or illegally intercepting voice mail messages mrs brooks , whom mr mcmullan called the archcriminal , is also suspected of making illegal payments to the police both have repeatedly denied the allegations , and neither has yet been charged nothing that mr mcmullan said was particularly surprising anyone following the phone hacking scandal that engulfed news international and its parent , the news corporation , over the summer is now more than familiar with outrageous tales of tabloid malfeasance what was startling was that mr mcmullan , who left his job in 2001 , eagerly confessed to so much and on such a scale no one else has done it quite this way and that he maintained that none of it was wrong most people from the tabloid world have reacted to the revelations in the manner of renault when discussing gambling in casablanca , saying they are shocked , shocked but mr mcmullan veered so far in the other direction that at times he sounded like a satirist s rendition of an amoral tabloid hack underhanded reporting techniques are not shocking at all , he said , particularly in light of how often he and his colleagues risked their lives in search of the truth as examples of the dangers of his job , he described having cocainelaced forced on him by knifewielding drug dealers in a sting operation being attacked by a crowd of murderous asylum seekers and , in his brad the teenage rent boy guise , sprinting through a convent dressed only in underpants to escape the pedophile priest he had successfully entrapped phone hacking is a perfectly acceptable tool , given the sacrifices we make , if all we 're trying to do is get to the truth , mr mcmullan said , asking whether we really want to live in a world where the only people who can do the hacking are mi5 and mi6 no , he said , we do not for a brief period of about 20 years , we have actually lived in a free society where we can hack back , he said journalists in britain have traditionally justified shady practices by arguing that they are in the public interest asked by an inquiry lawyer how he would define that , mr mcmullan said that the public interest is what the public is interested in i think the public is clever enough to decide the ethics of what it wants in its own newspapers , he said referring to articles about charlotte church , a singer who told the inquiry this week of her distress at her family s treatment by the tabloids , he said , if they do n't like what you have written about charlotte church s father having a threeinabed with cocaine , then they wo n't read it for all that , mr mcmullan said that the news of the world had come to rely too much on outsiders to do work that could have easily been done by reporters , like conducting surveillance on potentially adulterous athletes also , he said , some of the investigators were incompetent the year he became deputy features editor , he said , the department had a budget of 31 million more than 45 million to pay sources , buy stories and hire outsiders to find addresses , medical records and other information that was the joy of working for murdoch , he said they had that big pot of money mr mcmullan , who now owns a pub and does occasional freelance work , spoke nostalgically of his tabloid career , seven years of it spent at the news of the world he loved spiriting exclusive sources away and hiding them from other journalists , he said , as when he spent two weeks locked in a hotel room with princess diana s gym instructor in amsterdam he also liked jumping in one of the news of the world s stable of 12 cars and speeding away in pursuit of famous targets i absolutely loved giving chase to celebrities , he said how many jobs can you have car chases in \? before diana died , it was such good fun \( some celebrities liked it , too , he said brad pitt had a very positive attitude about being pursued by crazed journalists in cars \) mr mcmullan had brought along some illustrative materials , including a photograph of his surveillance van he also briefly displayed a topless photograph of carla brunisarkozy in the news of the world , apparently as a way to show how easy it is to obtain racy photographs that s the president of france s wife , he said it s a little early in the day for that , mr mcmullan , the inquiry lawyer said many witnesses at the leveson inquiry , especially victims of the tabloids , have called for a law to protect citizens from news media intrusion mr mcmullan said he thought that privacy was evil , in that it helps criminals cover up their misdeeds using a britishism for pedophile , he said , privacy is for pedos
santa fe , nm my son , ronan , looks at me and raises one eyebrow his eyes are bright and focused ronan means little seal in irish and it suits him i want to stop here , before the dreadful hitch my son is 18 months old and will likely die before his third birthday ronan was born with taysachs , a rare genetic disorder he is slowly regressing into a vegetative state he 'll become paralyzed , experience , lose all of his senses before he dies there is no treatment and no cure how do you parent without a net , without a future , knowing that you will lose your child , bit by torturous bit \? depressing \? sure but not without wisdom , not without a profound understanding of the human experience or without hardwon lessons , forged through grief and helplessness and deeply committed love about how to be not just a mother or a father but how to be human parenting advice is , by its nature , futuredirected i know i read all the parenting magazines during my pregnancy , i devoured every parenting guide i could find my husband and i thought about a lot of questions they raised will breastfeeding enhance his brain function \? will music class improve his cognitive skills \? will the right preschool help him get into the right college \? i made lists i planned and plotted and hoped future , future , future we never thought about how we might parent a child for whom there is no future the prenatal test i took for taysachs was negative our genetic counselor did n't think i needed the test , since i'm not jewish and taysachs is thought to be a greater risk among ashkenazi jews being somewhat obsessive about such matters , i had it done anyway , twice both times the results were negative our parenting plans , our lists , the advice i read before ronan s birth make little sense now no matter what we do for ronan choose organic or nonorganic food cloth diapers or disposable attachment parenting or sleep training he will die all the decisions that once mattered so much , do n't all parents want their children to prosper , to matter we enroll our children in music class or take them to mommy and me swim class because we hope they will manifest some fabulous talent that will set them and therefore us , the proud parents apart traditional parenting naturally presumes a future where the child outlives the parent and ideally becomes successful , perhaps even achieves something spectacular amy chua s battle hymn of the tiger mother is only the latest handbook for parents hoping to guide their children along this path it s animated by the idea that good , careful investments in your children will pay off in the form of happy endings , rich futures but i have abandoned the future , and with it any visions of ronan s scoring a perfect sat or sprinting across a stage with a harvard diploma in his hand we 're not waiting for ronan to make us proud we do n't expect future returns on our investment we 've chucked the graphs of developmental milestones and we avoid parenting magazines at the pediatrician s office ronan has given us a terrible freedom from expectations , a magical world where there are no goals , no prizes to win , no outcomes to monitor , discuss , compare but the daytoday is often peaceful , even blissful this was my day with my son cuddling , feedings , naps he can watch television if he wants to he can have pudding and cheesecake for every meal we are a very permissive household we do our best for our kid , feed him fresh food , brush his teeth , make sure he s clean and warm and well rested and healthy \? well , no the only task here is to love , and we tell him we love him , not caring that he does n't understand the words we encourage him to do what he can , though unlike us he is without ego or ambition ronan wo n't prosper or succeed in the way we have come to understand this term in our culture he will never walk or say mama , and i will never be a tiger mom the mothers and fathers of terminally ill children are something else entirely our goals are simple and terrible to help our children live with minimal discomfort and maximum dignity we will not launch our children into a bright and promising future , but see them into early graves we will prepare to lose them and then , impossibly , to live on after that gutting loss this requires a new ferocity , a new way of thinking , a new animal we are dragon parents fierce and loyal and loving as hell our experiences have taught us how to parent for the here and now , for the sake of parenting , for the humanity implicit in the act itself , though this runs counter to traditional wisdom and advice nobody asks dragon parents for advice we 're too scary our grief is primal and unwieldy and embarrassing the certainties that most parents face are irrelevant to us , and frankly , kind of silly our narratives are grisly , the stakes impossibly high conversations about which seizure medication is most effective or how to feed children who have trouble swallowing are tantamount to breathing fire at a dinner party or on the playground like dr spock suddenly possessed by al gore , we offer inconvenient truths and foretell disaster and there s this parents who , particularly in this country , are expected to be superhuman , to raise children who outpace all their peers , do n't want to see what we see the long truth about their children , about themselves that none of it is forever i would walk through a tunnel of fire if it would save my son i would take my chances on a stripped battlefield with a sling and a rock la david and goliath if it would make a difference but it wo n't i can roar all i want about the unfairness of this ridiculous disease , but the facts remain what i can do is protect my son from as much pain as possible , and then finally do the hardest thing of all , a thing most parents will thankfully never have to do i will love him to the end of his life , and then i will let him go but today ronan is alive and his breath smells like sweet rice i can see my reflection in his greenishgold eyes i am a reflection of him and not the other way around , and this is , i believe , as it should be this is a love story , and like all great love stories , it is a story of loss parenting , i 've come to understand , is about loving my child today now in fact , for any parent , anywhere , that s all there is
washington there is a joke in this town that goes something like this if you want to guarantee that a problem does not get solved , convene a committee to study it on the heels of a nasty showdown that led the nation to near default , a joint congressional committee is preparing to try to devise a deficitreduction plan that both parties can live with a goal that has eluded congressional leaders , a cadre of senators and the president the difficulty that this will have scaling the steep walls of ideology and partisan mistrust is lost on few , including its own members i approach this task like all tasks in washington , with high hopes and tempered expectations , said representative jeb hensarling , a texas republican and cochairman of the joint select committee on deficit reduction , whose six senate members and six house members are divided evenly by party this committee has very serious work to do , but it should not be confused with captain america or any other superhero the impediments to the committee s work lie as much in the way its success markers are defined as in the inherent partisan rancor and substantial financial conflicts among its members under the legislation written to raise the this month , if the committee fails to come up with a plan by nov 23 to cut the federal deficit by 12 trillion over 10 years , or if its proposals are not approved by congress roughly a month later , the government will automatically cut spending across a vast area of its operations , including the pentagon but the cuts would not be made until january 2013 , nearly a year after the trigger is hit , leaving members of congress to devise ways to avoid the fallout , even as they wrestle during the middle of a presidential campaign with a main component of the deficit debate the that are set to expire at the end of 2012 the trigger can get pulled , said josh barro of the , a conservative research organization but then there is a substantial amount of time to unpull the trigger when you look at the committee picks , it is really hardcore partisan people who are not likely to compromise , and some would prefer the trigger rather than the fight over the campaign season to come up with a plan privately , republicans and democrats are pondering which party would be more hurt by acrosstheboard cuts the committee members say there has been a political shift since the obama administration and congress failed to come up with a more sweeping plan to deal with the nation s debt , lending more urgency to their work after the debt ceiling was lifted , standard poor s downgraded the nation s credit , the stock market took a wild dip and polls demonstrated that voters have lost patience with washington there is just a lot more pressure now to accomplish something , said senator patrick j toomey of pennsylvania , a republican on the committee having the debt ceiling issue resolved also helps i think that since the economic nuclear bomb has been taken off the table , said representative chris van hollen of maryland , a democratic committee member , people can focus on this in a little fresh way but many impediments remain none of the republicans on the committee have indicated that there is much wiggle room on the revenue side of the ledger , beyond a willingness to end tax subsidies for some industries , like ethanol for their part , the democrats chosen for the panel are largely protective of the entitlement programs that represent the biggest part of the budget i do n't think this committee is going to achieve a full fix to our problems , because democrats have never wanted to put their health care bill on the table , representative paul d ryan , a wisconsin republican who leads the house budget committee , said on fox news sunday the central area of agreement between the two parties a need for major changes to the tax code is unlikely in the short time before the committee s deadline further , it is clear that there is some residual unpleasantness after the bitter debt ceiling fight some of the members i know , some i do n't , but i think i will keep my opinions of them to myself , mr hensarling said separate from the internal dynamics of the committee , each of the members has favorite causes or industry allies , which could influence their opinions on cutting spending or raising revenue for instance , senator patty murray of washington , a democratic member , has long promoted the interests of boeing , taking in more than 172 , 000 in donations from the company or its executives during her career mrs murray once ran an ad boasting about how she helped boeing win a 40 billion air force contract for its aerialrefueling tankers mr hensarling has pulled in hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks and wall street firms , including 57 , 800 in the last election cycle from goldman sachs further , special interest groups are waiting in the wings the sense around here is a lobbying bonanza , said jonathan collegio of , the republican advocacy group formed by karl rove watching with particular interest are groups that defend entitlement programs we 've had all these different gangs all looking basically at these same issues , david certner of , which is pushing to protect programs affecting older americans we 're just going to keep doing the things we 've been doing the same lobbying , the same strategy , the same message all six republicans on the committee have signed the pledge not to raise taxes dictated by grover norquist , who heads now , mr norquist said , he will focus on keeping the democrats in line the republicans are serious budget reformers the lady from washington , mr norquist said of mrs murray , does n't do budgets it is these kinds of statements that worry proponents of a deficit overhaul if these guys ca n't get it done , said alan simpson , the cochairman of president obama s , and are in thrall to the aarp and grover norquist , we ai n't got a prayer
central falls , ri these are trying times for the people of central falls , a city so close to fiscal collapse that the state seized control of city hall last summer taxes have risen nearly 20 percent to help solve the immediate crisis , unions have agreed to givebacks and the city of 19 , 000 all 129 square miles of it seems tinged with defeat but to hear mayor charles d moreau tell it , his suffering may be worst of all mr moreau , a democrat serving his fourth term , has not set foot in city hall since july 19 , the day that a stateappointed receiver took control the state police knocked on his door that morning , he said , demanded his cityowned car and cellphone and keys to city hall and handed him a letter announcing that his salary of 71 , 736 was being cut to 26 , 000 his role was now advisory , he was informed i was told they 'd call if they needed me , mr moreau said recently in a rare interview they have n't called since across the nation , cities and states are trying myriad ways of righting their fiscal ships as the recession plods on but locking the mayor out of city hall is generally not one of them a number of local governments are so financially distressed that states have assumed an oversight role several cities in michigan have emergency financial managers appointed by the state , for example , and in new york , a state board seized control of nassau county s finances last month but in those cases and others , local elected officials have retained some role the circumstances that have led to the difficulties in central falls may actually be widespread , said christopher w hoene , director of research for the national league of cities but not very many cities are in that dire straits mr moreau , 47 , is suing the state , asserting that the law allowing the takeover of financially troubled cities violates his constitutional right to due process , among other things he appealed to the rhode island supreme court after losing the first round and is awaiting a ruling meanwhile , the blunttalking mayor is working at his brother s real estate office , down the street from city hall , and stewing about the situation he finds himself in he has rebuffed calls to step down and , in fact , said he was already planning his 2013 reelection campaign my bumper stickers are ready to be printed , he said i 'd win reelection with 90 percent of the vote if the election was today his confidence seemed striking , in part because mr moreau is the subject of a state and federal corruption inquiry involving his hiring of a friend to board up dozens of abandoned buildings in town for about 2 million the friend , a contractor , also installed a new furnace in the mayor s house in 2009 , according to the providence journal , possibly charging less than it was worth mr moreau , a factory worker s son and former restaurant owner known around town as chuckie , would not discuss the investigation except to call it all political and all nonsense he said he had done nothing wrong mr moreau s administration took the state by surprise by declaring fiscal insolvency last may the city became the first in rhode island history to seek state bankruptcy protection , citing a deficit and retiree benefit obligations so profound as to seem insurmountable that alarmed the state , which feared that other beleaguered cities would follow suit , and bond rating agencies , which downgraded debt to junk status so the legislature swiftly enacted a law allowing indefinite state oversight , a measure mr moreau initially supported the receiver , mark a pfeiffer , a retired state judge , did not move into mr moreau s office when he arrived on the job , laying claim to a conference room instead the office remains locked , a curtain over the door mr pfeiffer said he saw no choice but to demote mr moreau to advisory status you could n't have somebody come in and perform the duties of the mayor and have somebody else being the mayor , he said it does n't work very well , and particularly it does n't work well in a distressed community mr pfeiffer tried to build a relationship with the city council , but within months it deteriorated and he reduced its members to advisory status he went to court in september to stop the mayor and the council from making new appointments , and soon after , mr moreau sued he said he had hired lawyers with his own money mr pfeiffer said he had refused to authorize city funds the suit calls the receivership law undemocratic , saying it violates the separation of powers doctrine by giving mr pfeiffer executive and legislative powers obviously here the people have been completely disenfranchised , said michael kelly , mr moreau s lawyer we have what i would suggest is a form of dictatorship a superior court judge upheld the law as constitutional in october , partly because the receivership was temporary , although without a specific term the law is not without precedent massachusetts put the city of chelsea under receivership in 1991 , removing the elected mayor and reducing other officials to advisers at oral arguments before the supreme court this month , some justices appeared skeptical of mr kelly s reasoning , with one saying of mr moreau and the city council , those were the people in charge when the ship hit the shoals yet the justices also questioned the state s lawyer aggressively , asking what was to stop mr pfeiffer from unilaterally changing city policies , like zoning , that had nothing to do with finance they also questioned whether anyone would run for office if the city remained under receivership , with justice francis x flaherty , a former mayor himself , asking , what do you run for \? advisory mayor \? his status notwithstanding , mr moreau said he still talked to the city s police chief and public works director daily , met with constituents and pursued economic development projects asked whether other city officials and residents still addressed him as mayor , he cracked , they 'd better mr moreau is known around town as a bareknuckled politician who rewards allies often , critics say , with city jobs and punishes enemies early in his tenure , he made waves by ordering a search of computers at the city library for campaign materials that favored a political opponent later , he championed the expansion of a detention center , cracked down on street violence and easily won reelection mr moreau said he had not bothered reading a lengthy report that mr pfeiffer submitted to the state in december with recommendations for averting fiscal collapse , including the possibility of merging the city with neighboring pawtucket the report said the city s problems were rooted in more than a decade of elected leaders' approving generous union contracts without figuring out how to pay for them the troubles worsened because of state aid reductions and inaccurate budget assumptions for example , the city anticipated 12 million in revenue from the detention center in 200910 and got none the city has started paying its bills again , but mr pfeiffer warned that central falls , with an annual budget of about 18 million , faced annual deficits of 5 million and combined pension and retiree health benefit obligations of about 80 million i think it s all nonsense , mr moreau said of mr pfeiffer s recommendations mr moreau also said he was galled by mr pfeiffer s salary of 200 an hour , and while at one point he said his court battle was not about the money , he also lamented that his wife had been forced to return to work and his youngest child to enter day care this was not my family plan , he said some residents clearly share the mayor s outrage , while others are hopeful about the receivership or indifferent sparky chippis , a restaurant owner and moreau ally who has known the mayor since childhood , described mr moreau s situation as an injustice the guy was elected by people , mr chippis said he had the trust of the people to be in the office over there but james diossa , the only council member who did not join mr moreau s lawsuit , said many residents appreciated the change the prior administration did n't do a great job as far as keeping the community informed , and the community really lost faith , said mr diossa , who heads an advisory council to the receiver mr pfeiffer said few citizens had complained to him , but mr moreau said that was because people were afraid they should be marching in the streets as to what s been done to me , he said mr pfeiffer stepped down earlier this month his term was up and the new governor , lincoln d chafee , an independent , wanted to appoint a trusted adviser , a spokesman said with the pick , robert g flanders jr , a former state supreme court justice , in charge , mr moreau said he was hoping to get a call i will send him a letter and be very frank with him that i'm here to help , he said
berlin a polar bear died and the zoo s director decided to stuff its body and put it on display in a museum \( the director prefers the technical term , dermoplastik , though to most people it s stuffed \) and that would be that , except this polar bear was on \( beside leonardo dicaprio \) , has a fan club in japan and followers in fiji , and was the most famous fourlegged resident of this city and the most renowned polar bear in the world we 're talking knut , the berlin zoo s handraised polar bear when someone dies in your family i think you do n't want him stuffed in a museum , said jochen kolbe , 31 , who is leading a protest movement to block the planned taxidermy knut is not only a polar bear for people , he is a friend , a family member now , hold on before casting any judgments the nemesis of the antistuffing crowd is the zoo s director , bernhard blaszkiewitz , a man whose zoo marketed this bear from birth , made millions off its presence , sold plush toy knuts for nearly 30 and knut baby videos for the same , and even registered knut as a trademark now , mr blaszkiewitz says he is shocked at how much people feel for this animal , who died , quite suddenly , at the age of 4 last month the problem is , people take their human feelings and put them into animals , he said , expressing astonishment at all the silly presents that mourners have deposited at the zoo , meaning the candles and flowers and posters it seems easy to poke fun at both sides in a conflict that has captivated this city at a time of political uncertainty in the nation and tragic uncertainty around the world and that is what a lot of people here have done , from newspaper headlines with a mocking tone \( aimed mostly at the antistuffing crowd \) , to snide about people needing to get a life \( yes , mostly aimed at those opposed \) to harsh remarks about the director of the zoo \( compared to a dictator by mr kolbe \) but the battle over knut s remains is a simple reminder that applying the formula of comparative importance to any conflict is meaningless to those touched by the conflict this may not be japan , or the middle east , but loss still feels like loss that is the message of the women on the bench in front of the polar bear enclosure at the zoo , the ones wearing buttons that read knut forever i do n't want to see him stuffed , said triste dittrich , her eyes moist as she passed around color snapshots of knut , as if handing out photos of grandchildren i want him to live on in my head as he was before , when he was alive doris webb sat on the next bench , her arms crossed against an afternoon chill and a reporter s question are you going to make fun of us , too \? she asked , her knut button proudly pinned to her chest there are a lot of people who say , how can you be so upset when so many people have died in japan \? ' what do you know about how i feel about what happened in japan \? i'm grieving about a very special bear to start at the beginning , knut \( pronounced knewt \) was a cotton puff of a creature born at the berlin zoo on dec 5 , 2006 his mother would have none of the cub , or his brother the zookeepers scooped the two from the enclosure , and there arose the first controversy animal rights groups opposed allowing the cubs to be raised by humans they said zookeepers should let them die but the image of a helpless ball of fluff generated an outpouring the brother died , but the keeper , thomas d rflein , nurtured knut with 24hour care and bottles of baby formula and cod liver oil the world was watching in spring 2007 , the zoo introduced its celebrity resident in what was dubbed knut day , inviting 400 journalists from around the world the knut phenomenon took off , much to the delight of a zoo that saw its revenue hit an alltime high that year and its attendance surge every birthday was marked with a fish and shrimp cake mrs webb said that once she and her husband retired , they visited the zoo nearly every day and found immense pleasure in watching knut for hours at a time apparently a lot of people did the bond between man and the bear , this was something very special , said erg n zmen , a young man seated on the bench near mrs webb the knut story was also shaped by tragedy , which made it more compelling to those drawn in the bear s trainer , mr d rflein , a minor celebrity in his own right , died suddenly of a heart attack at age 44 in september 2008 knut died just as suddenly , one saturday last month standing on a rock , he spun in circles , had a seizure , then fell into the water , where he died the problem is after the death of knut there was all the overwhelming feelings , said the director , mr blaszkiewitz while that s ok for humans , in my opinion it s not ok for animals that attitude is what generated opposition we all met in facebook , we all saw that we had the same interest against knut being stuffed , said mr kolbe , describing a pattern of organizing now the same for conflicts big and small the world over we planned a demonstration at the zoo showed up , including mrs webb and the other women on the bench although not everyone agreed on everything , they all agreed that the stuffing of knut must be stopped the people do n't want knut in a museum , but what the zoo director says , will happen , mr kolbe said he is like a dictator mr blaszkiewitz said he just wants the fuss to end , and it will , because the corpse has already been sent out , its skin removed and the procedure well under way this is just a polar bear , a special polar bear , but a polar bear all the same , he said to the people who bought the image of the bear the zoo had sold , that is the point when things went bad and you did n't feel well , then you came here and you felt better again , said anne kreiner , as she visited the zoo i'm really against this you would n't stuff your pets
many new yorkers have been following the construction of the new residential tower at 8 spruce street , just south of city hall , with a mix of awe and trepidation , the building s architect , has had a rough time in this city his first commission here , years ago , was for an upper east side town house that was never built his client , an oil heiress , fired him over champagne and strawberries a more recent foray , the massive development in brooklyn , , who depicted him as an aging liberal in bed with the devil a new york city real estate developer the spruce street project \( formerly called beekman tower \) would not only be mr gehry s first skyscraper , but it was also being built for the same developer , bruce ratner and as the tallest luxury residential tower in the city s history , it seemed to epitomize the skyline s transformation from a symbol of american commerce to a display of individual wealth only now , as the building nears completion , is it possible to appreciate what mr gehry has accomplished the finest skyscraper to rise in new york since eero saarinen s cbs building went up 46 years ago and like that tower , and philip johnson s att \( now sony \) building after it , 8 spruce street seems to crystallize a particular moment in cultural history , in this case the turning point from the modern to the digital age the tower , 76 stories high and clad in a rumpled stainlesssteel skin , stands at the northern edge of the financial district on a tight lot hemmed in by oneway streets the pace university building , a wide , brutaliststyle structure completed in 1970 , cuts it off from the rest of the city to the north just beyond are the spaghettilike access ramps of the brooklyn bridge to the west and north are two early landmarks of skyscraper design , and mckim , mead white s 1912 municipal building mr gehry s design is least successful at the bottom , where he was forced to plant his tower on top of a sixstory base that will house a new public grammar school and one floor of hospital services an odd coupling of private and public interests that was a result of political horse trading rather than any obvious benefit that would be gained from so close a relationship between the two the school is clad in conventional orange brick , with heavy steel frame windows that give it the look of a converted factory its main facade , with a glassfronted lobby facing william street to the east , is relatively straightforward , but it s a letdown after you 've seen the gorgeously wrought exterior of the tower above \( mr gehry did not design the interiors of the school , which is still under construction , and students may ask why the pampered young professionals living above them get to live in apartments designed by an architectural superstar while they will have to make do with a noname talent \) not surprisingly , the two groups wo n't be mixing residents will enter through a covered drive that cuts through the block along the building s western side framed by massive brick pillars and a glassenclosed lobby , the space s generous proportions will accommodate taxis and limousines ferrying people in and out of the building , making it feel more like a luxury hotel than a classic manhattan apartment building none of this matters much , however , once you see the tower in the skyline , a view that seems to lift lower manhattan out of its decadelong gloom the building is particularly mesmerizing from the brooklyn waterfront , where it s possible to make out one of the deep setbacks that give the building its reassuringly oldfashioned feel in daylight the furrowed surfaces of the facades look as if they 've been etched by rivulets of water , an effect that is all the more dramatic next to the clunky 1980s glass towers just to the south closer up , from city hall park , the same ripples look softer , like crumpled fabric \( the flat south facade is comparatively conventional , and some may find perverse enjoyment in the fact that the building presents its backside to wall street \) the power of the design only deepens when it is looked at in relation to gilbert s woolworth building a steel frame building clad in neogothic terracotta panels , gilbert s masterpiece is a triumphant marriage between the technological innovations that gave rise to the skyscraper and the handcrafted ethos of an earlier era mr gehry s design is about bringing that same sensibility the focus on refined textures , the cultivation of a sense that something has been shaped by a human hand to the digital age the building s exterior is made up of 10 , 500 individual steel panels , almost all of them different shapes , so that as you move around it , its shape is constantly changing and by using the same kind of computer modeling that he used for his guggenheim museum in bilbao , spain , more than a decade ago , he was able to achieve this quality at a close to negligible increase in cost but mr gehry is also making a statement the building s endlessly shifting surfaces are an attack against the kind of corporate standardization so evident in the buildings to the south and the conformity that it embodied he aims , as he has throughout his career , to replace the anonymity of the assembly line with an architecture that can convey the infinite variety of urban life the computer , in his mind , is just a tool for reasserting that variety that mission is expressed inside the building as well mr gehry has sometimes been criticized for creating wildly sculptural forms that are nothing more than masks elaborate wrappers draped over conventional interiors here the ripples that run up and down the facades form angular window bays inside , creating pockets of space that give the apartments an unusually intimate feel they also provide dramatically angled views of the surrounding skyline \( some apartments will even get occasional , unexpected views between neighboring apartments , a side effect that could be good or a bad depending on how many exhibitionists live there \) but in some ways it is the building s relation to yet another landmark the twin towers that makes 8 spruce street so stirring mr gehry won the commission to design his building sometime in late 2003 , just as the competition to redesign ground zero was heating up the seemed to reflect america at its worst a volatile mix of government ineptitude , commercial greed and jingoism its main emblem , the building formerly called the freedom tower , which is only taking shape today , remains an emblem of national hubris that is hollow at its core mr gehry s building , by contrast , does n't try to dominate the skyline its aims \( beyond the obvious commercial ones \) are comparatively modest to celebrate the joy that can come out of creative freedom and , by extension , to reassert the individual s place within a larger social framework his interest lies in the clashing voices that give cities their meaning it is democratic at heart
it has been one of newsweek s signature ventures and a staple of american political journalism since 1984 every presidential election season , the magazine detached a small group of reporters from their daily jobs for a year to travel with the presidential candidates and document their every internal triumph and despair all under the condition that none of it was to be printed until after the election then two days after election day , the sum of their reporters work would appear in the magazine but the ambitious undertaking , known inside the magazine simply as the project , is no more newsweek , bleeding red ink and searching for a fresh identity under new ownership , has decided the project would not go forward this election season explaining the decision to end the series , edward felsenthal , executive editor of newsweek and the daily beast , its online partner , cited the quickening speed of the news cycle in a news environment when scoops are often measured in milliseconds between twitter posts , fewer news organizations are comfortable waiting to publish the kinds of attentiongrabbing anecdotes that they would have once saved for longer articles sitting on election news felt to us out of place in an era where so much information comes out so fast , he said the pace seems measurably faster than even four years ago when many of the most titillating anecdotes about the 2008 campaign were reported in game change by john heilemann and mark halperin , a book that did not hit store shelves until january 2010 politico and random house have teamed up to produce serialized campaign ebooks that will be released in four installments as the presidential race unfolds the first is due out nov 30 and already has a title playbook 2012 the right fights back it is being cowritten by evan thomas , a former newsweek writer who worked on the election project , and edited by jon meacham , the former newsweek editor newsweek s move also shows how newsrooms are being forced to reprioritize sometimes in ways that seem anathema to their culture as their budgets get ever smaller for all news organizations , the cost of covering a presidential campaign has risen in recent years , with fewer journalists on the bus to share the cost the cost of campaign travel has soared , said peter goldman , a former newsweek editor and writer who conceived the idea for the project and remained involved in it until 2008 given newsweek s current financial troubles it was sold to sidney harman , the audio tycoon , last year for 1 and debt assumption and is on track to lose tens of millions of dollars again this year despite efforts at a turnaround he said the decision was understandable it was expensive to do , and they re looking at a lot of red ink in the last few election years , the costs for newsweek s project were approaching 1 million , people involved with it said the unusual structure essentially meant newsweek had two political reporting teams working entirely separate from each other a churchstate divide in which the reporters shared a photographer but not their notes the reporters writing for the weekly magazine would get much of their work done during the day while project writers would typically get their best material in the evening , often over long , expensive dinners out over the years , the project produced some memorable nuggets , like the quip john kerry reportedly uttered to an aide after learning george w bush had topped him in yet another poll i can t believe i m losing to this idiot there was also the indelible image of sarah palin , dripping wet and wearing nothing but a towel , breezing through her hotel room in minneapolis while aides for senator john mccain waited to speak with her i ll be just a minute , she told them it was an invention i was proud of while it lasted , mr goldman said i m sorry to hear it s dying but stuff happens in this new age
boston there was a point in the third quarter at td garden on tuesday night when looked around and must have figured he had stepped into an alternate basketball universe it was one where he had been traded not to the , but to the minnesota timberwolves , or a qualitative equivalent on another redhot playoff night against the , anthony was partnered with ronny turiaf and bill walker , jared jeffries and roger mason jr , melo and his merry band of ornery nonames and no longer was there any debate over who the knicks' leading man would have to be for what nearly turned into one of the greatest nonfinals games in the history of the franchise anthony was born for such situations , which began with the bad chauncey billups out with a strained knee and turned into the presumably catastrophic when amar'e stoudemire went down with back spasms in the second quarter but here was doc rivers , the celtics' coach , as washed out as a dehydrated boston marathoner , moments after a 9693 victory , recalling the moment when word arrived on the bench that stoudemire would not be returning rivers turned to lawrence frank , his assistant , and said , they got us right where they wanted if you have ever watched a tennis player struggle to vanquish a wounded but game opponent , then you can understand what the celtics resembled in trailing what remained of the knicks until nailed a jump hook in the lane with 133 seconds left and then snuffed out the knicks' last hope with a steal under the basket i could n't have been more proud of the team , knicks coach mike d'antoni said after seeing it fall behind , two games to none , in this firstround series by the composite difference of 5 measly points but there was also the inescapable truth that the knicks , having battled ferociously to give themselves a chance to return to madison square garden much healthier in spirit than body , failed to execute again when it counted most it was not anthony s fault , at least not the way he deserved much of the game 1 blame until an inspirational win devolved into another deflating defeat , anthony was walt frazier taking the baton from willis reed in game 7 of the 1970 finals he was bernard king with fingers taped like a mummy , taking it to the pistons in a decisive firstround game in 1985 to criticize anthony on a night when he rang up 42 points , grabbed 17 rebounds and had 6 assists would be a flagrant nitpicking foul but let us just say that the first two games of his knicks' playoff career or we should say endgames were paradoxical to the point where they could make for a compelling episode of the twilight zone anthony took a news media beating in the aftermath of game 1 when he fired up a 24foot 3point shot under doubleteam pressure with the knicks behind by 2 , enough time on the clock to drive and with toney douglas wide open to his left on the day off between games , d'antoni said he trusted that anthony would have wanted that shot back and that the biggest playoff possessions must be about trusting your teammates so here were the knicks , ahead by a point on the strength of a driving layup by the often allthumbs jeffries with 49 seconds remaining rivers called for a play with isolation options for paul pierce or garnett it should be obvious by now that he is one of the best in the coaching business at getting something good out of a timeout on cue , the knicks cut off the passing lane to pierce garnett established deep position in the lane his 11th and 12th points gave boston a 9493 lead now it was d'antoni s turn , plotting with the knowledge that the celtics would not allow anthony to go solo on anyone even if they had bill russell to play him jared was going to be under the basket , billy at the freethrow line , d'antoni said of jeffries and walker then he laughed at the inevitable query about anthony giving the ball up on the night he had tortured new england you all ca n't have it both ways , d'antoni said ca n't we \? jeffries , the goto guy at such a critical point in the game and the series \? when the fearless toney douglas was at his disposal \? jeffries caught the pass , turned and tried to hit a cutting walker garnett knocked the ball loose , fell on it and called timeout at 41 the knicks went to sleep and let delonte west circle into the backcourt and kill all but the final sixtenths of a second in a luxury suite , james l dolan was no doubt cursing his luck and maybe his coach but of course , this was the team he pushed hard to make happen , a big three of his own , without so little in reserve yes , anthony and the imperials gave him quite a show tuesday night , a moral victory for those scoring at home but as for what is next , stoudemire came into the interview room in a sleek gray suit , a standup guy who could not sit down i'm not sure , he said of his status for game 3 on friday night in new york at this rate , the knicks will need help just to finish the series maybe they can borrow a player or two from that very deep roster in denver

rio de janeiro not long ago a city bus drove me by rocinha , a sprawling favela of 100 , 000 people in southern rio with a global reputation for violence from the safety of my seat i watched the chaos beauty parlors were packed young people on motorcycles crisscrossed the paths at shocking speeds a group of school girls giggled as they took pictures with their phones of flirtatious boys strutting by funk and samba music blared out of the bars i loved the scene , but i wasn t about to get off the bus for a walk favelas are everywhere in a city of six million , more than one million people reside in more than 1 , 000 slums spread out across town but most middleclass brazilians like me do their best to avoid them they are the sort of places that princess diana and the pope visit to show compassion for the poor the rampant crime deters the rest of us the past 20 years have been particularly dreadful for favela residents a steep rise in drug trafficking and arms smuggling has fed a brutal gang culture the gang bosses tend to be teenagers and young adults who display their rifles , revolvers and grenades with pride they have the cash to buy fancy shoes and shiny jewelry they die young three years ago , in preparation for hosting the world cup and olympic games , the rio authorities got their act together rather than merely patrol the favelas , which had done little good over the decades , the police started occupying them , military style the occupations begin with a raid first , the police swoop in by helicopter and personnel carriers then they go doortodoor chasing gang leaders sometimes gunfights ensue eventually , the police set up stations at the heart of the favelas , and disarm the locals street by street in theory at least , as they establish control , they pave the way for government services and public utilities last month the police occupied rocinha they had announced the impending raid in hopes of avoiding a bloodbath the approach worked , with 47 arrests so far but no deaths or even gunfights what the police confiscated in the first week of the occupation illustrates the power of the gangs 185 illegal weapons , 199 explosives , 166 kilograms of cocaine , 138 kilograms of marijuana , 232 stolen motorcycles and 22 stolen cars rio s authorities are feeling confident now having occupied 19 favelas thus far , they plan to occupy a total of 40 by 2015 the new policy has many fans favela occupations , supporters say , are a prerequisite for taking care of the poor , who for too long have been ignored by the politicians \( illiterate brazilians only got the vote in 1985 \) occupations are a step toward giving favela dwellers a chance to live better , with basic things like access to paved streets and lighting they are a prelude to a more peaceful and prosperous town but the occupations have many detractors some residents worry that corrupt police officers will take over the drug trade there have been stories detailing police abuse including reports of militias made up of firemen and retired and offduty police officers that shake down favela residents meanwhile , some residents are unhappy that they will now have to pay higher bills for electricity and internet connections and many are appalled that the police have restricted , or altogether banned , the funkmusic parties that draw hordes on weekend nights the occupations might end up fueling new kinds of violence there is no way to know if they will work but we do know that the strategy offers a new sense of possibility where once there was none
the religion clause case recently argued before the supreme court hosannatabor v eeoc centers on the ministerial exception , the doctrine \( elaborated over the last 40 years \) that exempts religious associations from complying with neutral , generally applicable laws in some , but not all , circumstances in 2005 cheryl perich , a teacher in the hosannatabor lutheran evangelical school , returned from an extended sick leave \( she had been diagnosed with narcolepsy \) to find that her services were no longer wanted she declined to resign as requested , and after a resolution satisfactory to her was not forthcoming she filed a disability discrimination suit the church responded by terminating her as a teacher , alleging that its reason was theological , not retaliatory the missouri synod , the church explained , requires its adherents to resolve disputes rather than bring suit in civil court in failing to follow this rule , perich had transgressed a core lutheran belief the church further argued that as a commissioned minister perich fell under the ministerial exception even though the bulk of her time was spent teaching secular subjects perich \( through her attorneys \) replied that her duties were not primarily religious , and that the assertion of a doctrinal violation was an afterthought devised to serve as a pretext for an act of retaliation in response to her having gone to the courts in an effort to secure her rights so the issues are , first , was she a minister in the sense that would bring her under the exception \( in which case the state could not intervene to protect her \) , and , second , was the doctrine the church invoked as the reason for its action truly central to its faith \? \( there are other issues in play but , as we shall see , two are more than enough \) the most perspicuous example of a ministerial exception is the catholic church s limitation of membership in the priesthood to males if a university were to have a rule that only men could serve as professors , it would be vulnerable to a suit brought under the antidiscrimination provisions of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 the difference \( or so it has been asserted \) is that there is no relationship between professorial skills and gender a woman can perform the duties of a teacher of history or chemistry as well as a man while the tradition of an allmale priesthood is rooted in religious doctrine so the university would be engaged in discrimination pure and simple , whereas the church s discrimination is a function of its belief that the allmale priesthood was initiated by christ in his choice of the apostles were the state to intervene and declare the tradition of an allmale priesthood and the doctrine underlying it unconstitutional , it would be forcing the church to conform to secular norms in violation both of the free exercise clause \( the right of a religion to be governed by its own tenets would be curtailed \) and the establishment clause \( the state would in effect have taken over the management of the church by dictating its hiring practices \) \( i am rehearsing , not endorsing , these arguments \) this clearcut example to which both sides in hosannatabor v eeoc refer frequently may be the only one \( and it is only clearcut because it has behind it 2 , 000 years of history \) for the question quickly becomes one of boundaries how far does the ministerial exception extend \? to whom does it apply \? not only are there no answers to such questions , it is not obvious who is empowered to ask them if the ministerial exemption is to have any bite , there must be a way of distinguishing employees central to a religious association s core activities from employees who play only a supporting role \( the example always given is janitors \) but if the line marking the distinction is drawn by the state , the state is setting itself up as the arbiter of ecclesiastical organization and thus falling afoul of the establishment clause and if the line is drawn by the religious association , the religious association is being granted the power to deprive as many of its employees as it likes of the constitutional protections supposedly afforded to every citizen it is these equally unpalatable alternatives this scylla and charybdis that the justices find themselves between in oral argument what a mess ! it is tempting to bypass the mess by getting rid of the ministerial exception altogether and demanding that churches , synagogues and mosques obey the law just as everyone else does but that draconian solution would imply that we get rid of the religion clause as well for it would amount to saying that religion isn t special , and both sides of the clause insist that it is the freeexercise clause tells us that that religion is especially favored and the establishment clause tells us that it is especially feared \( the state should avoid entanglement with that stuff \) how do you honor the claims of free exercise without bumping up against the establishment clause by allowing exceptions to laws that everyone else must follow \? the difficulty is sometimes finessed by cabining free exercise in the private sphere free exercise , it is said , is fine as long as its scope is limited to the expression and profession of belief but once it crosses over into actions the state has a duty to regulate , free exercise must give way to the authority of fair and neutral laws \( this is the holding of a line of cases from reynolds v united states 1878 to employment division v smith 1990 \) this cutting of the joint works fine for a religion that places minimal burdens on its adherents and asks only that they attend to the personal relationship between them and their god but what about religions that expand the area of faith to include rites the faithful must celebrate and worldly actions they are expected to perform \? what about religions that refuse to recognize , and even consider impious , the distinction between the private and the public spheres \? can the state step in and say , no , you re wrong that practice you re worried about isn t really essential to your faith give it up so that a system of laws put in place for everyone isn t destroyed by exceptions doesn t society , justice sonia sotomayor asked at oral argument , have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable , even if religious \? the question is , at what point \? and who gets to decide when that point has been reached \? indeed there is a question even more basic \( and equally unanswerable except by fiat \) who gets to say whether a certain conduct is religious and centrally so \? a resolution of the hosannatabor case , justice samuel alito observes , depends on how central a teaching of lutheranism the injunction against suing in a civil tribunal really is before we can decide \( he continues \) whether the church s asserted reason for terminating perich is a pretext , we must determine whether this is in fact a central tenet of lutheranism and if we decide that it isn t , wouldn t we be making a judgment about the relative importance of the catholic doctrine that only males can be ordained as priests and the lutheran doctrine that a lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts \? and what authorizes the court to do that in opposition to what the churches themselves say \? the same dilemma attends the other vexed question how , wonders chief justice john roberts , do we decide who s covered by the ministerial exception \? by getting to the heart of the ministerial exception , answers douglas laycock , speaking for the church but that is simply to relocate the problem in a phrase that itself demands explication who s to say where the heart is \? in some churches , justice anthony kennedy observes , there aren t full time ministers at all they re all ministers so does everyone fall under the exception and can a nonhierarchical church simply declare that none of its members can seek redress for acts of discrimination because they re all ministers \? just before the oral argument concludes , justice sotomayor is still awaiting clarification so define minister for me again \? she will be waiting forever there is no way out of these puzzles , and that is exactly the conclusion justice stephen breyer reaches i just can t see a way of getting out of the whole thing justice alito points to the absurdity of calling in expert witnesses to determine the truth of disputed matters of religion , but , he asks , how are we going to avoid that \? i just don t see it later he concludes that you just cannot get away from evaluating religious issues , which is of course exactly what the courts are not supposed to be doing so how will the case turn out \? clearly none of the justices wishes to pronounce as a theologian and just as clearly none of them is happy with the prospect of a ministerial exception without defined limits breyer gestures in the direction of a solution that avoids the hard questions grant the church the core doctrine it cites and inquire into whether perich was given adequate notice of it if she was , she loses if she wasn t , she wins but no one will be satisfied with that maneuver , which will itself raise a host of new unanswerable questions in place of the questions supposedly avoided all these questions were explored by john locke at length in his letter concerning toleration \( 1689 \) , and at one point locke gives voice to a weariness we might echo today would that this business of religion were left alone but as long as there is a religion clause , that s not an option
do the former directors of the institutions that collapsed during the financial crisis have anything to worry about \? if the experience of enron is any example , the answer is a resounding no a look back at the career paths of onetime enron directors indicates that the former directors of bear stearns and lehman brothers will continue their prominent careers enron collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001 amid accusations of accounting improprieties and outright fraud the scandal sent shock waves through corporate america , but compared with the global financial crisis , it almost seems small and quaint still , in the case of enron , unlike in the financial crisis , top corporate executives went to prison most prominently , jeffrey skilling , a former chief executive of enron , was sentenced to 24 years in prison yet while some enron executives paid a price for the scandal , it is a different story with enron s former directors the people charged with overseeing the company a search of their current whereabouts shows that they have recovered nicely from the scandal four former enron directors still serve on public boards frank savage , for example , still heads his own investment firm and serves on the boards of bloomberg lp and lockheed martin norman p blake jr serves on the board of owens corning , where he is the head of that company s audit committee a number have gone back to or entered academia wendy gramm , the wife of the former senator phil gramm , vice chairman of ubs investment bank , is still in residence at the mercatus center at george mason university robert k jaedicke , who was chairman of enron s audit committee , teaches at the stanford university graduate school of business and lord john wakeham has remained chancellor of brunel university in london the private sector enron directors also continued their careers without much of a hiccup ken l harrison retired as chief executive of the portland general electric company in 2000 and ronnie c chan has remained chairman of the hang lung group in hong kong since enron s collapse most of the remaining directors have since retired or now work in small private or family businesses , a euphemism for semiretirement john mendelsohn , for example , is to retire next month as head of the university of texas md anderson cancer center then there is rebecca markjusbasche she was named one of the luckiest persons in houston by fortune magazine ms markjusbasche left the enron board in 2000 , selling more than 80 million worth of company stock she now runs family properties in new mexico and colorado a few of the directors conveniently omit enron from their biographies , but they do not appear to remain tainted , staying in their chosen professions the only court penalty placed upon them was related to a 165 million settlement of shareholder litigation arising from enron s demise the directors personally had to pay a relatively large 13 million the rest was covered by insurance the experiences of the enron directors over the last decade would appear to offer great hope to the directors of bear stearns and lehman brothers indeed , many of these directors remain not only as directors of public companies from before the financial crisis , but they have joined new boards even alan greenberg is still on the viacom board with a fellow bear board alumnus , frederic v salerno , who serves on six public company boards in all , 6 of the 12 bear directors at the time of the investment bank s collapse are still directors of public companies none of the bear directors have appeared to have career difficulties the two academics on the board were the rev donald j harrington , who remains the president of st john s university , and henry s bienen , who is emeritus president of northwestern university frank t nickell is still chief executive , president and chairman of kelso company , while paul a novelly remains ceo of the apex oil company in fact , with the exception of james e cayne , none are fully retired or appear to be having trouble finding good positions it is the same for lehman brothers , with richard s fuld jr , the former chief executive , bearing the brunt of the public approbation he is at his own firm , matrix advisors , and fairly or unfairly remains the focus of blame for lehman s demise as for the other lehman directors , six of them held directorships as recently as january jerry a grundhofer was appointed to the citigroup board after lehman s fall he has since resigned from that board , but he remains on the boards of ecolab and the midland company roland a hernandez joined the sony board and still remains on the boards of mgm mirage , the ryland group and vail resorts the rest of the board members were mostly private investors roger s berlind was and still is a theatrical producer michael l ainslie , former chief executive of sotheby s , is a private investor christopher gent is a senior adviser to the consulting group bain company as well as nonexecutive chairman of glaxosmithkline so the bear and lehman directors are returning to public company service even quicker than the enron directors in part this reflects the old boy network on wall street , which keeps people in the same positions because of friendships it is not a coincidence that two former bear stearns directors serve on the viacom board the trend also underscores the decline in the importance of reputation on wall street even since the time of enron prior bad conduct simply is often not viewed as a problem but in the case of the bear and lehman directors there is another significant factor the financial crisis was an enormously complex event , and people will be debating its causes for years to come blame can be dispersed , and an executive or director can simply say it was the crisis itself not poor management or inadequate board supervision that caused their firm s demise i am not arguing that these directors be tarred and feathered or that they should not be able to earn a living , but rather that there should be market penalties for failure just as ms gramm s mercatus center often argues at a minimum , one would think that other public companies might be more hesitant to keep these failed directors on their boards in the end , the directors of companies that failed in the financial crisis will most likely receive an even freer pass than the enron directors this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print drawings drawing \( b1 \) drawing \( drawing by harry campbell \) \( b5 \)
every once in a while a politician comes up with an idea that s so bad , so wrongheaded , that you 're almost grateful for really bad ideas can help illustrate the extent to which policy discourse has gone off the rails and so it was with senator joseph lieberman s proposal , released last week , to raise the age for medicare eligibility from 65 to 67 like republicans who want to end medicare as we know it and replace it with \( grossly inadequate \) insurance vouchers , mr lieberman describes his proposal as a way to save medicare it would n't actually do that but more to the point , our goal should n't be to save medicare , whatever that means it should be to ensure that americans get the health care they need , at a cost the nation can afford and here s what you need to know medicare actually saves money a lot of money compared with relying on private insurance companies and this in turn means that pushing people out of medicare , in addition to depriving many americans of needed care , would almost surely end up increasing total health care costs the idea of medicare as a moneysaving program may seem hard to grasp after all , has n't medicare spending risen dramatically over time \? yes , it has adjusting for overall inflation , medicare spending per beneficiary rose more than 400 percent from 1969 to 2009 but inflationadjusted premiums on private health insurance rose more than 700 percent over the same period so while it s true that medicare has done an inadequate job of controlling costs , the private sector has done much worse and if we deny medicare to 65 and 66yearolds , we 'll be forcing them to get private insurance if they can that will cost much more than it would have cost to provide the same coverage through medicare by the way , we have direct evidence about the higher costs of private insurance via the medicare advantage program , which allows medicare beneficiaries to get their coverage through the private sector this was supposed to save money in fact , the program costs taxpayers substantially more per beneficiary than traditional medicare and then there s the international evidence the united states has the most privatized health care system in the advanced world it also has , by far , the most expensive care , without gaining any clear advantage in quality for all that spending health is one area in which the public sector consistently does a better job than the private sector at controlling costs indeed , as the economist \( and former reagan adviser \) bruce bartlett , high us private spending on health care , compared with spending in other advanced countries , just about wipes out any benefit we might receive from our relatively low tax burden so where s the gain from pushing seniors out of an admittedly expensive system , medicare , into even more expensive private health insurance \? wait , it gets worse not every 65 or 66yearold denied medicare would be able to get private coverage in fact , many would find themselves uninsured so what would these seniors do \? well , as the health economists austin frakt and aaron carroll , right now americans in their early 60s without health insurance routinely delay needed care , only to become very expensive medicare recipients once they reach 65 this pattern would be even stronger and more destructive if medicare eligibility were delayed as a result , mr frakt and mr carroll suggest , medicare spending might actually go up , not down , under mr lieberman s proposal ok , the obvious question if medicare is so much better than private insurance , why did n't the affordable care act simply extend medicare to cover everyone \? the answer , of course , was interestgroup politics realistically , given the insurance industry s power , medicare for all was n't going to pass , so advocates of universal coverage , myself included , were willing to settle for half a loaf but the fact that it seemed politically necessary to accept a secondbest solution for younger americans is no reason to start dismantling the superior system we already have for those 65 and over now , none of what i have said should be taken as a reason to be complacent about rising health care costs both medicare and private insurance will be unsustainable unless there are major costcontrol efforts the kinds of efforts that are actually in the affordable care act , and which republicans demagogued with cries of death panels the point , however , is that privatizing health insurance for seniors , which is what mr lieberman is in effect proposing and which is the essence of the gop plan hurts rather than helps the cause of cost control if we really want to hold down costs , we should be seeking to offer medicaretype programs to as many americans as possible
as she did in her secondround match , no 11 seed jelena jankovic stepped onto the court for her thirdround match against no 17 anastasia pavlyuchenkova with a game plan but unlike in her routine win thursday , jankovic s poor execution saturday rendered that plan irrelevant she lost in straight sets , 64 , 64 showing none of the form that took her to the final in cincinnati two weeks ago , jankovic had trouble keeping the ball in the court on even the most routine shots against the normally more erratic pavlyuchenkova jankovic , the 2008 us open runnerup , sprayed 35 unforced errors to only 13 winners more than half \( 35 of 65 \) of the points pavlyuchenkova won were off jankovic s unforced errors on match point , pavlyuchenkova hit a first serve that registered at only 71 miles per hour jankovic promptly shanked her forehand return wide of the doubles alley the pair , who have played doubles together several times earlier this year , greeted each other warmly at the net after the two chatted for a bit , jankovic let pavlyuchenkova shake the chair umpire s hand first , then , apparently absentmindedly , forgot to shake the official s hand herself , her carelessness on louis armstrong stadium extending beyond the final point the win puts pavlyuchenkova into the fourth round of the second consecutive year she will face no 7 seed francesca schiavone , who beat pavlyuchenkova at both last year s us open and this year s french open schiavone saved a match point in her threeset thirdround win against chanelle scheepers
two of my favorite analysts , rhodes cook and josh putnam , have a good debate going about just how plausible it is that a republican who is not currently running for president could enter the race later and potentially win it \( probably necessitating a brokered convention \) those of you who follow my twitter feed will know that i think mr cook has the stronger side of the argument i think there is a small but nontrivial chance that the republican nominee could be someone like jeb bush , paul ryan , mitch daniels , tim pawlenty or chris christie \( in fact , i was speculating about these scenarios as long as a month ago \) i m not going to describe the means by which this would occur mr cook covers that in great detail instead , i m more interested in the motive the motive is simple republicans are dangerously close to having none of their candidates be acceptable to rankandfile voters and the party establishment it s not clear what happens when this is the case there is no good precedent for it but since finding a nominee who is broadly acceptable to different party constituencies is the foremost goal of any party during its nomination process , it seems possible that republicans might begin to look elsewhere a recent gallup poll asked republican voters directly about which candidates they d consider acceptable nominees only two , newt gingrich and mitt romney , were deemed acceptable by a majority of republican voters the other six candidates \( including herman cain , who has since dropped out \) were considered unacceptable by a majority of the party s voters unfortunately , this particular question is not asked all that often by pollsters \( a shame , since it s a really important question \) so i cannot offer categorical proof that this situation is unprecedented gallup did pose the question to both republican and democratic voters in 2007 , however , and the results from that poll suggest that the predicament that republicans now find themselves in is at a minimum unusual in 2007 , both democrats and republicans had four broadly acceptable candidates rather than two of course , a party does not need four acceptable candidates it needs only to settle on one but the two republicans who fit this description for the time being , mr romney and mr gingrich , might become unacceptable to a majority of the party depending on how nasty the nomination fight gets mr romney is already considered unacceptable by 41 percent of republican voters , and his favorability ratings have been fading recently although he is still ok for now , he does not have all that much margin to spare it s plausible that his ratings could turn negative if he runs a negative campaign , as other candidates begin to criticize him , or if he makes one or two significant gaffes mr gingrich has a fair amount of personal baggage and his favorability ratings were quite poor with republican voters at points earlier in this cycle he is now taking fire from all sides , including from mr romney , from other candidates , like ron paul , and from portions of the conservative media but say that mr gingrich survives this , as he certainly could he wins iowa and then either wins new hampshire or finishes a respectable second there he continues to lead in national polls of republican voters , as he does now what happens then \? one possibility probably the most likely one is that mr gingrich wins south carolina , wins florida and holds on to win the republican nomination but mr gingrich might nevertheless be considered an unacceptable choice by much of the party establishment that would put us in uncharted waters there hasn t really been a case in the past where a candidate who held the national polling lead after new hampshire was considered unacceptable by the party elite most of the time , the establishment \( as measured by endorsements \) and the rank and file \( as measured by support in national polls \) have agreed upon a candidate by that point there have been six cases in recent decades in which there was no clear frontrunner after new hampshire these are discussed briefly below 1972 democrats edmund s muskie , the clear favorite of the party establishment , won both iowa and new hampshire the performances were perceived as disappointing , however , and mr muskie was at only about 20 percent in national polls \( still good enough to put him in a rough tie with hubert h humphrey \) a third candidate , george mcgovern , who had helped to design the reformed nomination rules and cagily exploited them by dominating in caucus states , won the nomination despite taking only about 25 percent of the national popular vote 1976 democrats party leaders were slow to endorse any candidates in 1976 , but jimmy carter surged to the national polling lead after wins in iowa and new hampshire although mr carter was a relatively obscure figure who was not beloved by the party establishment , he nevertheless took the nomination this is among the more favorable precedents for mr gingrich , although it differs slightly from this year in that there was no consensus among the establishment about whom to support in place of mr carter 1984 democrats walter mondale was the clear favorite of the establishment and seemed headed for an easy nomination after a dominant performance in iowa the favorable media attention to gary hart s secondplace showing , however , gave him momentum that he rode to a victory in new hampshire , after which he drew into a rough tie with mr mondale in the national polls mr mondale eventually prevailed in a close race 1988 democrats michael dukakis , the eventual nominee , had won new hampshire but had lost iowa to dick gephardt mr dukakis was roughly tied for the endorsement lead with al gore , and was roughly tied in the national polls with jesse jackson thus , mr dukakis was in the strongest overall shape , although he was not dominant in any one category , so the nomination took some time to sort out 2008 democrats this was a strange case hillary rodham clinton regained the national polling lead after her comeback win in new hampshire however , barack obama who had once considerably trailed mrs clinton in party support announced a series of important endorsements from senators like john kerry and claire mccaskill in the week just after new hampshire , making the question of who had the party establishment s support ambiguous 2008 republicans john mccain pulled into the national polling lead after his win in new hampshire , although it took further wins in states like south carolina and florida before endorsers \( who had long been split between mr mccain , mr romney , rudolph w giuliani and fred thompson \) closed ranks around him although there are some loose parallels to this year in the 1972 and 1976 democratic primaries , none of them involved an acute conflict between the establishment and the rank and file of the sort we have this year between mr romney and mr gingrich it is not a year like 2008 , when the democrats had at least two broadly acceptable nominees , in which you d expect to see a brokered convention or a darkhorse candidate emerging instead , it s a year like this one , in which all the choices are unacceptable to some degree or another there are deterrents , of course , to a candidate like mr bush or mr ryan entering the race late most notably , there is no guarantee that they would succeed if they tried and failed , that could be an unmitigated disaster for the republican party , undermining its eventual nominee but the odds of a darkhorse candidate or brokered convention will increase to the extent that any of the following conditions hold 1a mr gingrich leads the delegate count , but does not have more than about 50 percent of delegates 1b mr gingrich holds more than 50 percent of delegates but is involved in a significant gaffe or scandal at some point later in the campaign 2a mr romney has performed poorly enough in the early states that he is no longer viable 2b mr romney is viable but his unfavorability ratings have considerably increased to the point that he no longer qualifies as a consensus choice 3 a factional candidate like ron paul holds 10 percent or 15 percent of the delegates all of these conditions seem plausible based on what we know right now , which is what leads me

washington the question from reporters always comes up these days , but dwayne roloson would have none of it no , not at all , roloson , the goalie , said after being asked if he appreciated being in the playoffs more keenly at 41 does n't matter if you 're 10 or 50 or 100 i think you still appreciate it the same way was it special to be in the playoffs for the first time since 2006 \? no when you have n't played in them in a little while , it makes no difference , he said how about the strong emotions of the playoffs surely it must be nice to experience those again \? no you still have the same enthusiasm , the same mental makeup , the same everything as when you were in training camp , he said the lightning acquired roloson from the islanders on jan 1 , and he has propelled the team into topcontender status he is the secondoldest player in the nhl , next to 43yearold mark recchi of the boston bruins but he also had the highest save percentage in the playoffs so far \( 949 going into sunday s game 2 of the secondround series against the washington capitals , won by the lightning , 32 , in overtime \) roloson was practically invincible as the lightning rallied from a threegamestoone deficit to beat the pittsburgh penguins in the opening round he won game 7 , 10 , with 36 saves , boosting his career mark in elimination games to 60 with a 951 save percentage when asked to describe roloson s performance , lightning coach guy boucher , who is a year younger , said , i have to get some new words steven stamkos , the lightning s 21yearold goalscoring star , called roloson our mvp , for sure reporters asked roloson if he had gone into game 7 expecting to get a shutout do you ever go into writing an article figuring you 're going to win the nobel peace prize \? roloson answered no it had nothing to do with me it was all about our guys who did everything humanly possible to prevent any good quality shots it has been a long road for roloson but the longer roloson travels it , the better he gets roloson was an allamerican at the university of massachusettslowell , but went undrafted he was signed by the calgary flames in 1994 and played two seasons there before being signed as a free agent by the buffalo sabres , where he backed up dominik hasek for two years roloson bounced around the minors before resurfacing with the minnesota wild , where he had a breakthrough in the 2003 playoffs he rallied the wild from a 31 series deficit to beat vancouver in 2004 , roloson , then 34 , was chosen for the allstar game , but minnesota kept missing the playoffs his next stop was edmonton , where in 2006 he helped the oilers capture the last playoff spot and then led them to the stanley cup finals but a knee injury in game 1 put him out of the series , which the oilers lost in seven games to carolina the oilers deteriorated , and roloson signed with the equally dismal islanders in 2009 from then until jan 1 , roloson guarded their nets , a generally thankless task that he did well , recording a 909 save percentage for a young team that allowed numerous oddman rushes and breakaways this season , the lightning , under new ownership and a new general manager , steve yzerman , knew it had a great attack , with stamkos , martin st louis , vincent lecavalier and simon gagne but among the league s goalies , tampa bay s dan ellis and mike smith ranked near the bottom in save percentage so yzerman dealt the islanders defenseman ty wishart , and roloson stabilized tampa bay with four shutouts and a 912 save percentage over the remainder of the season with the islanders , the job was to hold the fort while the young players learned with the lightning , the immediate ambitions are much greater but roloson , who will become a free agent july 1 , would not concede any substantial difference the islanders are a pretty classy organization that treated my family and myself really well , he said to leave was sad , but at the same time , i was going to an organization with new ownership , new management , new coaching staff it s a great team to be part of so it was sad , but with a happy ending against washington , roloson is looking down the ice at michal neuvirth , the capitals' 23yearold rookie goalie neuvirth has never lost a playoff series in north america a run of 14 series that includes the 2007 memorial cup with plymouth of the ontario hockey league and the 2009 and 2010 calder cups with hershey of the american hockey league but stamkos will take his old guy we 've seen in previous years what he s done , stamkos said , and he s doing it again now current and former teammates say roloson can joke around and even crack up at his own quips but publicly , he is very serious he has said he has a 12hour rule half a day after a game to think about his performance , win or lose , and then forget about it and move forward he s such a competitor , even in practice , stamkos said but he s a great team guy he always wants to be around the guys , go out for dinner but when it s time to be serious , he s that guy across the room , reporters were asking roloson if he minded that every article about him referred to how ancient he was no , not at all , though it s the first time i had ancient' thrown into an interview , roloson said was that a smile that played briefly across his face \? if it was , it was gone instantly roloson , again , was having none of it to me it s a number it does n't matter , he said people can say whatever they want to me it does n't make a difference
of the roughly 1 , 000 relics stolen from museums and archeological sites in egypt since the sweeping protests began there in january , none were items of major importance , said , egypt s minister for antiquities , agence francepresse reported there is an inventory of everything , and it will be difficult for the items to leave the country , mr hawass told the spanish newspaper el mundo on sunday , adding that the thieves were probably looters who lived near the sites , as opposed to organized criminals , and that they probably had little knowledge of the value of the goods they had pilfered many of the relics were taken from the egyptian museum in cairo , which houses much of the king tutankhamen collection , as well as the tombs of hetepka at saqqara and empi at giza
tucson many people had a glimpse of the deep delusions and festering anger of , but none seemed in a better position to connect the dots than officials at pima community college after the release of detailed reports the college kept of mr loughner s bizarre outbursts and violent internet fantasies , the focus has turned to whether it did all it could to prevent his apparent descent into explosive violence in september , pima suspended mr loughner and told him not to return without a psychologist s letter certifying that he posed no danger but it took no steps to mandate that he have a psychiatric evaluation , which in arizona is easier than in many states laura j waterman , the clinical director of the in tucson , criticized pima officials for not seeking an involuntary evaluation where does it reach a level where you say this person should n't be a part of any community and we have a responsibility to do something about that \? she said dr waterman s clinic , which offers walkin psychiatric crisis care , is one of the agencies pima refers students to when they need services , including students who have been suspended like mr loughner no record of mr loughner s seeking or receiving mental health care has surfaced it is part of our practice to provide students with information of where they can go , said charlotte fugett , an official at the college it s their responsibility to find a practitioner pima , a lowcost commuter school with 68 , 400 students , is typical of in having no mental health center of its own at residential colleges , the centers can make it easier to connect needy students to  paul schwalbach , a college spokesman , said of mr loughner , his behavior , while clearly disturbing , was not a crime , and we dealt with it in a way that protected our students and our employees last year , pima updated its policies for dealing with disturbed students , as did campuses across the country after several deadly shootings , including the killing of 32 at virginia tech the college created a team of senior officials to identify students who might pose a threat to themselves or others they began meeting the same month that mr loughner was suspended paradoxically , suspending students like mr loughner may push them over the edge by adding to their grievances and isolating them from people who could monitor them , said experts on campus violence gene deisinger , the director of threat management at virginia tech , in blacksburg , va , speaking in general about the dismissal of a disruptive student , said , we should never treat that as a panacea that increases our safety when virginia tech removes a threatening student or staff member as it does about a dozen times a year the campus police or sometimes a psychologist now monitor the person s progress when it is practical and merited , dr deisinger said marisa randazzo , coauthor of a sweeping 2002 of school violence after the columbine shootings , said most gunmen experienced a personal loss before their outbursts if a school expels a threatening student , she said , you are now adding to the person s losses , even if you 're within your legal rights to do so at the same time , you 're losing your own ability to keep an eye on their behavior or have a positive effect , she said mr loughner , 22 , who has been accused of killing 6 people and wounding 14 , including representative gabrielle giffords , at a safeway store in tucson on saturday , did not return to his former campus or workplace for a  on the northwest campus where he took many of his classes from 200510 , a group of students on break wednesday debated how the college had handled him moises melgarejo , 18 , said he wondered if the act of suspending mr loughner had not left him precariously unrooted he was n't going to school , he was n't working , he was just sitting at home thinking whatever he was thinking , he said denise hayes , president of the association for university and college counseling center directors , said pima had done what most colleges would in placing the responsibility to get a mental health exam on the student , especially since , as the college says , it also delivered the ultimatum to mr loughner s parents , with whom he lived the nationwide adoption of campus threat teams like pima s which typically meet once a week on large campuses , often below the radar of students has been rapid since investigations of the virginia tech massacre showed that many people and departments had clear signs of the instability of the gunman , seung hui cho , but no one connected the information virginia and illinois passed laws requiring colleges and universities to establish multidisciplinary threatevaluation teams today , more than half of the country s 4 , 500 colleges and universities acknowledge the need and have formed some capacity to assess student threats , said steven healy , a former princeton university police chief , who leads training programs in threat assessment under a grant from the justice department on tuesday , he was leading a workshop for 70 educators in phoenix , which he began with a moment of silence at virginia tech , the threat assessment team a national model , whose members include the dean of students the director of counseling a university lawyer and dr deisinger , a psychologist who also holds the title of deputy police chief meets weekly , discussing 6 to 20 cases a campus web site about the team answers a hypothetical question , ca n't you just make people leave campus if they are a problem \? in this way when people remain part of the virginia tech community , oncampus resources are available to them , and campus administrators are in contact with them to provide support they might not have if they were removed in arizona , people can be sent involuntarily for a mental health exam after any concerned party applies for a courtordered evaluation , which can lead to mandated treatment stella bay , the police chief for pima , said the college could initiate an involuntary evaluation only if a student posed an imminent danger but that assertion seemed to reflect a misunderstanding of the state s laws regarding involuntary evaluations dr waterman , of the southern arizona mental health corporation , said a mandated evaluation required only some evidence of danger it s a broader standard , she said and it costs nothing to make a phone call and talk about it and consult with a professional since the weekend shootings , the number of petitions for mandated exams at dr waterman s clinic has increased , she said , presumably because of wide awareness of the issue now in fact , ms bay called in a case on monday about a pima student , dr waterman said the police brought the student right to a hospital to be evaluated
it has always been the goal to create a small world feel here on motherlode i hadn t realized how small it had become until one reader recognized herself in another reader s comments last week she would like to explain and ask your advice about her trip home i read with interest the post about malaysia airlines decision to ban babies in first class particularly because one of the earlier comments , from coldbagel , referred to what sounded suspiciously close to a flight i recently took with my 15monthold son coldbagel wrote after paying full price for a seat in business class in order to get a good sleep on my way back to france , i and every other passenger in business class were kept awake the whole way by a baby who screamed every few minutes it was not crying it seemed to be that child s method of communicating with the mother i and many others were ready to tear our hair out when we reached europe with very little sleep i have two children whom i flew with often when they were young i have much sympathy for parents who fly with their children but i always prepared well for the flight and taught my children to calm themselves and stay quiet then i always carried benadryl just in case that did not work you have to understand that others do not care to hear the tantrum or the screams of your adorable little baby for hours on end in a very small space call me paranoid , but the details sounded a little too similar to our flight from san francisco to paris besides feeling incredibly defensive as i read that and the many other hostile comments , i mostly had this irresistible urge to explain we , too , paid full price for four businessclass tickets for myself , my husband and our two children why did we choose business over first or coach \? 1 \) coach is insanely cramped many standard car seats don t fit in a coach airline seat and there s no reasonable alternative to restrain an infant on a plane \( i tried the cares harness with my first son it worked fine , until i was forced to remove it by a flight attendant who insisted it was not allowed , despite it being clearly labeled as faaapproved that was a fun fivehour trip \) business class seats , however , accommodate the car seat very well beyond that , there s simply not enough room in economy for all the junk required for traveling with kids you re continually reaching down to your bag below the seat in front of you to get bottles , toys , crayons , wipes , benadryl , snacks , selfhelp books , etc i m only 5foot1 , and even i can t do it comfortably in coach my husband is over 6 feet tall frankly , i d rather be back in steerage , where everyone is miserable together , but there s not enough room there for me , my child and all of our works and pomps and remember , we re not talking about a lap infant here we bought him his own fullprice seat 2 \) first class is a luxury option , a celebratory indulgence for many we considered this choice , but we didn t want to run the risk of ruining what may be a onceinalifetime experience for someone \( we also had reservations about raising kids who feel entitled to first class travel business was already pushing it , but for reasons mentioned above , we felt it was a reasonable compromise \) so we made the decision for business , and up until literally two nights before our flight , my son had been a mostly model child , easily distracted and soothed , and generally charming and malleable even in stressful situations we never imagined it was possible for him to cry on and off \( more on than off , frankly \) for nine hours when he came down with a viral infection \( not easily contagious , according to his pediatrician , who gave him the full green light for travel \) a few days before we were leaving on a trip that had been planned for over six months , what were we supposed to do \? while our businessclass flights were fully refundable , our expensive hotel and rental car reservations were not nor could we ask the relatives we were visiting to reschedule their time off and trips planned around the specific dates of our visit we stocked up on the baby drugs \( none of which helped in the slightest during the flight , by the way \) and headed off with extreme trepidation and dread i m not sure what all the hostile commenters assume of us parents of babies traveling that we raise little monsters whose incorrigible behavior we enjoy inflicting upon your precious ears \( which are apparently too sensitive for the airlineprovided earplugs and headphones \) \? believe me , it s way more stressful for me as a parent to have my child crying for the whole flight than it is for you at least you can pop an ambien and put on your headphones and doze off while watching the tourist do you think i savor every moment knowing my child is preventing others from sleeping \? do you think i feel completely aok with having to bounce , walk and make futile attempts to entertain the little demon for hours on end \? yes , i love him unconditionally , and yes , i think he s cuter than you think he is but that doesn t mean i zealously volunteered to have him suffer loudly and inconsolably for 9 out of our 11 hours trapped together in close quarters i m actually quite fine with airlines banning babies in certain classes of ticket i d definitely be the first to sign up for the opposite , a familyfriendly flight , where my blood pressure didn t spike every time my baby let out one of his terrible bleats but for now , on air france , he s allowed in business class so please take your anger and selfrighteous indignation out on air france , and not on me or my child or my parenting skills mostly because i can guarantee you we enjoyed the flight much , much less than you did by the way , i m still in france and would love to ask your readers a provocative question how are we supposed to get home \?
growing up in rockford , ill , the television writer and producer shawn ryan , 44 , was always fascinated by chicago , the big , bad metropolis just 90 miles away so when his acclaimed series the shield ended its run on fx in 2008 , and he began to think about what he might want to do next , chicago naturally popped into his mind as a kid i 'd travel there to play soccer or hockey or see pro sports , and i was always in awe of the place and curious about its people , he said it s a wellrun , worldclass city but with a history of favor swapping and corruption , which people accept as the way it is , and that dichotomy was interesting to me i did n't want to do just another cop show after the shield' set in los angeles and moving my focus to chicago allowed me to look at how the city works and expand to corruption and undercover police work two years later that curiosity has given birth to the chicago code , an hourlong drama that is to have its premiere on monday at 9 pm on fox and true both to mr ryan s initial creative impulse and his childhood impressions of the city , the series has a story line set right at the intersection of politics and crime , derived from the notorious maxim attributed to an alderman and saloon keeper named paddy bauler , chicago ai n't ready for reform shot on location , has three main characters teresa colvin , played by , is the city s first female police superintendent her efforts to bring down the corrupt , mafiafriendly alderman ronin gibbons \( \) lead her to grant her former patrol car partner , detective jarek wysocki \( jason clarke \) , license to combat wrongdoing wherever he finds it for ms beals her role as a toughtalking cop halfblack and halfwhite , trying to hold her own in a macho , workingclass ethnic environment is almost the polar opposite of her last big television character , bette porter on the showtime series the l word i 've gone from fulltilt estrogen to fulltilt testosterone , she said in a recent telephone interview born and raised in chicago , ms beals has a deep store of associations and memories on which to draw for her role a few years ago , she said , she and her mother went to visit the south side apartment where ms beals spent her early childhood , only to discover that where we once lived was now a crack den , with vials crunching under my feet , so that i was having to step over bodies in what used to be our kitchen as mr ryan sees it , casting ms beals was important for the image he wants to convey with the series physically and intellectually she is the embodiment of chicago and how far you can rise , he said she is someone who grew up in a mixedrace family in a town that was very racially divided , and still is , and through smarts and hard work went to francis parker , an elite , progressive private school , and then on to yale she s got a lot of the traits i ascribe to the city television series have been set , explicitly or not , in chicago before , dating back to hill street blues and crime story in the 1980s and including cbs s current hit the good wife but only rarely are they shot on location the good wife is filmed mostly in new york , with recognizable new york landmarks sometimes in the background the chicago code , initially titled ridealong , is unusual in that it was written specifically to capitalize on locations mr ryan considers underutilized these include the downtown lakefront , grant park , housing projects , the el tracks and gritty neighborhoods like austin , on the city s far west side , all of which figure , often with dramatic camera work , in the 13 episodes that fox has ordered we 're all kind of semisick of seeing new york and los angeles , and i'm one of the culprits who is responsible , mr ryan said i think the bar is higher these days in terms of audience expectations of authenticity people want to feel like what they are watching is really happening , and you ca n't do la well enough to be chicago i felt it was a crucial thing , and i think it has an effect on performances when your cast breathes the air and interacts with the city on a daily basis , they become chicagoans that same philosophy seems to motivate other recent television series that use the city where they are set almost as additional characters burn notice , now in its fourth season , heavily features the landscape and landmarks of miami , and fairly legal , which had its premiere last month , does something similar with san francisco both series are on the usa network it also helps that cities like chicago and detroit , where the new abc series detroit 187 is shot , offer tax credits more generous than those of traditional production centers , thus reducing costs producers' eyes are wide open looking for the best deals around , and illinois tax credits , while not the largest , are certainly competitive when you add in chicago s production values , infrastructure and talent , said rich moskal , director of the chicago film office mr lindo , who was born in london and also lived in toronto before coming to the united states , said he found mr ryan s insistence on shooting in chicago to be valuable to get a better sense of his character , he spent time with several aldermen , even accompanying them as they met with constituents and attended city council meetings , where he studied their demeanor and body language i 've played cops , and i 've played robbers , said mr lindo , whose film credits include get shorty and david mamet s heist but i do n't believe i 've played politicians , and so the idea of playing one in chicago , a city with its own unique and complicated dynamic , genuinely fascinated and challenged me some of the benefits of being in the city were amorphous , just walking the streets , talking to people , feeling the hawk a slang term for what makes chicago the windy city blowing in from the lake and hoping you 'd absorb certain things by osmosis those are all things we would n't have gotten if we were shooting on a soundstage or in toronto mr ryan said he placed an equally high value on verisimilitude of the story , so when it came time to have the initial version of his script vetted , he turned to another chicago connection john folino , a 35yearold homicide detective still on active duty the two men first met after mr folino won a police charity auction whose prize was a walkon role on the shield , and mr folino was pleased to offer his advice on what he called little chicagospecific things that would give the series more authenticity for example , we do n't call the guys we apprehend perps , said mr folino , who eventually signed on as the show s technical adviser that s a new york thing here they are either offenders or just bad guys he also arranged for cast members to ride along with chicago police officers to get a sense of the challenges they face mr clarke compared the experience to a journalist embedding himself with troops in afghanistan but in the end , mr folino conceded , the chicago code is meant to be entertainment , not a chicago police reality show so it takes some liberties with the facts , beginning with its central premise , that one of the primary responsibilities of the chicago police department which has a long history of scandals of its own , including internal burglary , robbery and kidnapping rings and repeated instances of brutality against political protesters and racial minorities is to crack down on corruption and malfeasance most of the investigations here have been by the us attorney s office and the fbi , or inspector generals for different units of government , said , a former chicago alderman who now heads the political science department at the university of illinois at chicago none of those have police assigned to them still , during the shooting of the first season , reality kept intruding and blurring what was intended to be fiction mr clarke , born in australia , recalled one dark , snowy morning when he was looking for that day s location in austin and came across police officers who had been recruited as extras in a couple of episodes we rolled up , i saw the tape on the street and thought we were setting up a scene , he said but it was one of the cops cordoning off a real crime scene , a homicide i do n't think anything can compare to that kind of action which you ca n't get anywhere else but shooting on the streets of the city where your story is set
boston the ' playoff goaltending has been a mess wednesday night was no different brian boucher made a great sidetoside save to deny the ' brad marchand on a backdoor tipin 26 seconds into game 3 four seconds later , the puck slid to zdeno chara , who slapped it past boucher 10 , bruins thirtythree seconds later , david krejci wristed a shot past boucher 20 , bruins the bruins went on to a 51 victory that gave them a threegamestonone lead in the eastern conference semifinals boucher was given the hook by coach peter laviolette in the second period , making this the sixth of 10 playoff games in which a flyers starting goalie did not finish the game laviolette said the first two goals were not boucher s fault , but that of a surprisingly flat team the first three minutes , four minutes in a visiting team s building have to be good minutes , he said obviously the start was not good for us of course , the bruins were up by 30 on the flyers last year and philadelphia rallied to win the series in seven games based on boston s performance at td garden and especially the flawless work of goaltender tim thomas it is hard to believe they will collapse again thomas kicked out 37 shots after his terrific 46save performance monday in a 32 overtime victory by conducting a clinic in angle work he plucked screened shots out of the air and defied conventional goaltending by coming out well beyond the lip of his crease to attack shooters , running his consecutivesave total to 68 before andrej meszaros scored for philadelphia with 3 minutes 34 seconds left in the second period by that time boston had scored four goals the fourth came from nathan horton with 4 46 to go in the second period , a shot that went between the legs of boucher , who has been lifted four times this spring the door opened for sergei bobrovsky , and boucher went off , stalking down the corridor to the dressing room , hurling his useless stick before him boucher finished with 16 saves on 20 shots , leaving his playoff save percentage at 904 bobrovsky s is 875the playoff save percentage for thomas , who won the vezina trophy in 2009 and is expected to win it again this year , stands at 935 thomas was on the bench last year when the flyers rallied with four straight wins to beat the bruins tuukka rask was in goal for boston , but now he is the backup unless the flyers produce another miracle , the bruins could claim their second series here friday night in game 4 it would be the first time since 1992 that the bruins won two series in the same postseason we learned last year that the fourth win is the hardest , thomas said hopefully we just hit the reset buttons in our minds , and the games before do n't mean anything it s one game at a time , one period at a time , one shift at a time hopefully we approach it like that the bruins finally broke their powerplay drought when chara beat bobrovsky during a twoman advantage with 1 22 left in the game until that goal , chara s second of the game , the bruins had gone 0 for 30 in the playoffs with a man advantage when the bruins beat montreal in seven games in the first round , they became the first team in nhl history to win a bestofseven series without scoring a powerplay goal slap shots jeff carter , the flyers' leading scorer in the regular season , returned after a fivegame absence for a knee injury defenseman chris pronger missed his second straight game with an undisclosed injury believed to involve the broken hand that forced him to sit out the last six weeks of the regular season
the religion clause case recently argued before the supreme court hosannatabor v eeoc centers on the ministerial exception , the doctrine \( elaborated over the last 40 years \) that exempts religious associations from complying with neutral , generally applicable laws in some , but not all , circumstances in 2005 cheryl perich , a teacher in the hosannatabor lutheran evangelical school , returned from an extended sick leave \( she had been diagnosed with narcolepsy \) to find that her services were no longer wanted she declined to resign as requested , and after a resolution satisfactory to her was not forthcoming she filed a disability discrimination suit the church responded by terminating her as a teacher , alleging that its reason was theological , not retaliatory the missouri synod , the church explained , requires its adherents to resolve disputes rather than bring suit in civil court in failing to follow this rule , perich had transgressed a core lutheran belief the church further argued that as a commissioned minister perich fell under the ministerial exception even though the bulk of her time was spent teaching secular subjects perich \( through her attorneys \) replied that her duties were not primarily religious , and that the assertion of a doctrinal violation was an afterthought devised to serve as a pretext for an act of retaliation in response to her having gone to the courts in an effort to secure her rights so the issues are , first , was she a minister in the sense that would bring her under the exception \( in which case the state could not intervene to protect her \) , and , second , was the doctrine the church invoked as the reason for its action truly central to its faith \? \( there are other issues in play but , as we shall see , two are more than enough \) the most perspicuous example of a ministerial exception is the catholic church s limitation of membership in the priesthood to males if a university were to have a rule that only men could serve as professors , it would be vulnerable to a suit brought under the antidiscrimination provisions of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 the difference \( or so it has been asserted \) is that there is no relationship between professorial skills and gender a woman can perform the duties of a teacher of history or chemistry as well as a man while the tradition of an allmale priesthood is rooted in religious doctrine so the university would be engaged in discrimination pure and simple , whereas the church s discrimination is a function of its belief that the allmale priesthood was initiated by christ in his choice of the apostles were the state to intervene and declare the tradition of an allmale priesthood and the doctrine underlying it unconstitutional , it would be forcing the church to conform to secular norms in violation both of the free exercise clause \( the right of a religion to be governed by its own tenets would be curtailed \) and the establishment clause \( the state would in effect have taken over the management of the church by dictating its hiring practices \) \( i am rehearsing , not endorsing , these arguments \) this clearcut example to which both sides in hosannatabor v eeoc refer frequently may be the only one \( and it is only clearcut because it has behind it 2 , 000 years of history \) for the question quickly becomes one of boundaries how far does the ministerial exception extend \? to whom does it apply \? not only are there no answers to such questions , it is not obvious who is empowered to ask them if the ministerial exemption is to have any bite , there must be a way of distinguishing employees central to a religious association s core activities from employees who play only a supporting role \( the example always given is janitors \) but if the line marking the distinction is drawn by the state , the state is setting itself up as the arbiter of ecclesiastical organization and thus falling afoul of the establishment clause and if the line is drawn by the religious association , the religious association is being granted the power to deprive as many of its employees as it likes of the constitutional protections supposedly afforded to every citizen it is these equally unpalatable alternatives this scylla and charybdis that the justices find themselves between in oral argument what a mess ! it is tempting to bypass the mess by getting rid of the ministerial exception altogether and demanding that churches , synagogues and mosques obey the law just as everyone else does but that draconian solution would imply that we get rid of the religion clause as well for it would amount to saying that religion isn t special , and both sides of the clause insist that it is the freeexercise clause tells us that that religion is especially favored and the establishment clause tells us that it is especially feared \( the state should avoid entanglement with that stuff \) how do you honor the claims of free exercise without bumping up against the establishment clause by allowing exceptions to laws that everyone else must follow \? the difficulty is sometimes finessed by cabining free exercise in the private sphere free exercise , it is said , is fine as long as its scope is limited to the expression and profession of belief but once it crosses over into actions the state has a duty to regulate , free exercise must give way to the authority of fair and neutral laws \( this is the holding of a line of cases from reynolds v united states 1878 to employment division v smith 1990 \) this cutting of the joint works fine for a religion that places minimal burdens on its adherents and asks only that they attend to the personal relationship between them and their god but what about religions that expand the area of faith to include rites the faithful must celebrate and worldly actions they are expected to perform \? what about religions that refuse to recognize , and even consider impious , the distinction between the private and the public spheres \? can the state step in and say , no , you re wrong that practice you re worried about isn t really essential to your faith give it up so that a system of laws put in place for everyone isn t destroyed by exceptions doesn t society , justice sonia sotomayor asked at oral argument , have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable , even if religious \? the question is , at what point \? and who gets to decide when that point has been reached \? indeed there is a question even more basic \( and equally unanswerable except by fiat \) who gets to say whether a certain conduct is religious and centrally so \? a resolution of the hosannatabor case , justice samuel alito observes , depends on how central a teaching of lutheranism the injunction against suing in a civil tribunal really is before we can decide \( he continues \) whether the church s asserted reason for terminating perich is a pretext , we must determine whether this is in fact a central tenet of lutheranism and if we decide that it isn t , wouldn t we be making a judgment about the relative importance of the catholic doctrine that only males can be ordained as priests and the lutheran doctrine that a lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts \? and what authorizes the court to do that in opposition to what the churches themselves say \? the same dilemma attends the other vexed question how , wonders chief justice john roberts , do we decide who s covered by the ministerial exception \? by getting to the heart of the ministerial exception , answers douglas laycock , speaking for the church but that is simply to relocate the problem in a phrase that itself demands explication who s to say where the heart is \? in some churches , justice anthony kennedy observes , there aren t full time ministers at all they re all ministers so does everyone fall under the exception and can a nonhierarchical church simply declare that none of its members can seek redress for acts of discrimination because they re all ministers \? just before the oral argument concludes , justice sotomayor is still awaiting clarification so define minister for me again \? she will be waiting forever there is no way out of these puzzles , and that is exactly the conclusion justice stephen breyer reaches i just can t see a way of getting out of the whole thing justice alito points to the absurdity of calling in expert witnesses to determine the truth of disputed matters of religion , but , he asks , how are we going to avoid that \? i just don t see it later he concludes that you just cannot get away from evaluating religious issues , which is of course exactly what the courts are not supposed to be doing so how will the case turn out \? clearly none of the justices wishes to pronounce as a theologian and just as clearly none of them is happy with the prospect of a ministerial exception without defined limits breyer gestures in the direction of a solution that avoids the hard questions grant the church the core doctrine it cites and inquire into whether perich was given adequate notice of it if she was , she loses if she wasn t , she wins but no one will be satisfied with that maneuver , which will itself raise a host of new unanswerable questions in place of the questions supposedly avoided all these questions were explored by john locke at length in his letter concerning toleration \( 1689 \) , and at one point locke gives voice to a weariness we might echo today would that this business of religion were left alone but as long as there is a religion clause , that s not an option
on a stormy summer afternoon sat in a noisy mexican restaurant a few blocks south of lincoln center wearing a tshirt with the words wisconsin we conserve the world of this american ballet theater star is about to turn upside down when he becomes the artistic director of royal new zealand ballet next month but for now mr stiefel is just another midwestern transplant if better looking and fitter than most who lives in new york city and will always love the green bay packers it s a shock , he said of the distance between new zealand and new york you 're sitting there , having a drink overlooking the water , and the next stop is the south pole over the years mr stiefel , a youthful 38 , has consistently raised eyebrows around the ballet world for his outofleftfield professional moves before taking the reins of the 32member royal new zealand ballet which he likes to call an adventure he was dean of the school of dance for the university of north carolina school of the arts , artistic director of ballet pacifica in california and the star of the 2000 film center stage he s even appeared in an episode of gossip girl but taking over the royal new zealand ballet is also a natural progression for him it helps too that mr stiefel has family in new zealand his grandmother was born and raised there and he s certainly held his share of leadership positions after mr stiefel s experience in north carolina where he spent more time writing education policies than in the studio the creative side of the new post is a plus i see my job as not only building the art and the company but building the identity of dance in new zealand , which is an opportunity , he said you do n't always have that other places are established , and know how they want to do it last season , after casting had been announced , he withdrew from ballet theater s performances to wrap up his duties in north carolina he also said he was n't in good enough physical shape i was pulling rabbits out of a hat even being as disciplined as i was the last couple of years , he said this summer instead of dancing , he studied kyokushin karate in new york with shihan katsuhito gorai and volunteered as a fight announcer for the i just needed something else to keep me moving , he said but none of this means he has retired from ballet theater i 'll take a deep breath , and once i get over there , i 'll reassess how much will i be able to do physically myself \? my priority as a director is to the company my career is performing , and i love performing , but that s what comes with taking on this new challenge he still plans to appear next spring at the metropolitan opera house , where , incidentally , he proposed last spring to his longtime girlfriend , the dancer the occurred backstage during ballet theater s gala performance mr stiefel recalled , she said , we have to get off the stage' i just went , gillian , refocus' and she said , i do , i do ! ' it was pretty cute it was pretty gillian it was also , for kevin mckenzie , the company s artistic director , pretty funny \( he was n't backstage at the time \) i thought i was going to see people on their knees at every corner , he said mr mckenzie has consistently given mr stiefel the freedom to pursue opportunities elsewhere while retaining his principal status at ballet theater ms murphy , who plans to dance with the new zealand company , will continue to perform with ballet theater but will appear in fewer tours in the end i do n't believe that it s productive to hold somebody back from something , mr mckenzie said if they are eyeing something that they wish they could be doing , then they 're not doing their job they need to make their own mistakes and successes , not mine and if i can afford to do it , i will the royal new zealand ballet , formed in 1953 by the danish dancer poul gnatt , is a relatively small classical company that began as a scrappy , doityourself operation now the repertory is an eclectic mix of fulllength classical productions and shorter works by contemporary choreographers this means that mr stiefel could have much to do with shaping ballet culture in the country he applied for the job at the urging of his friend the danish dancer johan kobborg , who told mr stiefel that it was a company with a good reputation where he could have flexibility as a director amanda skoog , the company s managing director , said in an email of mr stiefel s selection we 've never had an american at the helm before , and i think it will herald some big changes and open new doors for us , which is fantastically exciting we were looking for someone who could recognize and nurture young talent and take us to the next level when the interview process had developed to the point of bringing mr stiefel to wellington , where the company is based , he insisted that ms murphy make the journey too we decided to walk around and for a moment we were like , are we in toronto \? ' we covered most of downtown in an hour but as the days went on , we realized that there is great food , it s very eclectic , and the vibe is quite funky mr stiefel , who has signed a threeyear contract , will be hands on , with only one ballet master and one ballet mistress to assist him in the studio the company s first production under his directorship is sleeping beauty , in which stella abrera , a ballet theater soloist , will appear as a guest artist for his first program as artistic director mr stiefel will showcase a new yorkcentric evening along with george balanchine s who cares \? , set to gershwin , there will be a premiere by larry keigwin and benjamin millepied s 28 variations of a theme by paganini along with more balanchine ballets , he is also eager to introduce works by frederick ashton , jerome robbins and twyla tharp mr stiefel will also choreograph or stage at least one major production per year the first , in 2012 , will be a new version of giselle by mr kobborg and himself and , no apart from a nutcracker in north carolina , mr stiefel has n't choreographed before i ca n't say it was easy , but it kind of flowed , he said of the experience of tackling the nutcracker i found it was probably the most important thing i did in terms of my rapport with everybody i worked with at the school , including my students he s eager to branch out for the scenic design of giselle , mr stiefel is inspired by the english artists aubrey beardsley and william morris as well as by the idea of exploring the psychological makeup of characters like myrtha , the implacable queen of the wiles why is myrtha the way she is \? he asked we 're going to try to explore things like that ms murphy is taking a backseat to mr stiefel s vision happily and will perform with the company as well as coach we are n't the type of people to make it the ethan stiefelgillian murphy show , she said , adding , that s not how we are still , the whole lifechanging situation has one glitch selah , the couple s abyssinian cat who drinks water straight out of the faucet and snuggles with more sincerity than a golden retriever that s is our biggest dilemma , mr stiefel said with a sigh the problem is the travel you ca n't even put her in a cab to take her to the vet but then again we ca n't really live without her
