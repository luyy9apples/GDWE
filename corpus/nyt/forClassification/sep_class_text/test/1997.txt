orlando , fla , may 1 anfernee hardaway has been brilliant the orlando magic s comeback has been shocking and if the magic beat the miami heat again on sunday , it will complete one of the most dramatic playoff upsets in national basketball association history carried by hardaway s heart and talent , the magic beat the heat , 9991 , tonight , to even the teams' threeoffivegame firstround series at 22 game 5 will be played sunday afternoon at miami arena and while the heat will have the home court , the magic will have the momentum only five teams in league history have recovered from a 20 deficit to win a fivegame series , but orlando hopes to be no 6 sunday s winner will face the knicks in the second round a matchup that coach pat riley and his miami team desperately want but the magic has other ideas few people gave orlando a chance in this series after miami won the first two games by an average of 25 points , running over an injuryriddled team that looked ready for vacation but something happened when the series moved to orlando penny hardaway happened he has lifted his game to another level , and his teammates have loved the ride after scoring 42 points in game 3 , hardaway came back with 41 points tonight , playing all 48 minutes and simply refusing to let orlando lose hardaway grabbed rebounds , he made big shots , and it hardly mattered what miami did , because hardaway did almost anything he wanted it was a great player performing at his best penny is like the second coming of michael jordan , said orlando guard gerald wilkins he did it all , and we jumped on his back it starts with him , just like in chicago it starts with michael jordan penny is the one guy on this team who can carry us hardaway shot 12 for 23 from the field , including 4 for 8 from 3point range four miami players took turns defending hardaway voshon lenard , keith askins , jamal mashburn and dan majerle it made no difference all of them were at hardaway s mercy alonzo mourning \( 23 points , 13 rebounds \) and p j brown \( 20 points , 13 rebounds \) led miami , but for the second consecutive game , the heat was outplayed by a smaller , quicker orlando team that has caused major matchup problems riley does not like to doubleteam players , and for the most part , he did not doubleteam hardaway riley may have to reconsider , because he needs answers after game 4 , he had none when you go to the playoffs , there are no guarantees , said riley , whose face the last two games has been the same color as miami s road uniforms red people made the assumption that it was going to be easy for us obviously , not with the crowd at orlando arena going wild , the magic built a 14point halftime lead and controlled play the rest of the way meanwhile , the heat lost composure and confidence , looking nothing like a team that had the league s best road record \( 329 \) players such as derek strong \( 15 points \) , darrell armstrong \( 12 points \) , wilkins \( 11 points \) and danny schayes \( 10 points \) have stepped forward in place of the injured rony seikaly and horace grant orlando s character was being questioned after game 2 those questions have been answered i'm very , very proud of my group , said richie adubato , orlando s interim coach , who has done a splendid job of making miami adjust to orlando s style of play we did n't think we could do it again , but we had a tremendous effort i thought our defense was outstanding it s very gratifying for me , because of the way we lost the first two naturally , everybody counted us out asked about hardaway , adubato said he has demonstrated in the last two games that he s going to be one great superstar in this league i gave him a break the other day , he played 47 minutes i could n't give him one minute today orlando grabbed early momentum , and the noisy crowd loved it , chanting , beat the heat ! beat the heat ! a jumper by tim hardaway \( 16 points \) pulled miami within 9489 with 2 minutes 13 seconds left but after an orlando timeout , the magic went to anfernee hardaway \( who else \? \) , who was fouled by mashburn with 1 55 left hardaway made one of two foul shots to give orlando a 6point lead then mourning lost the ball on miami s next possession , and orlando hung on the postgame mood in miami s locker room ranged from frustration to anger mourning refused to speak with reporters , and he added some expletives in case anyone did not get the message tim hardaway also declined comment brown sat in front of his locker and tried to explain what happened one thing was certain nobody in the heat locker room was looking past orlando anymore we know penny s getting the ball , but we 're not doing a very good job stopping him , brown said he s killing us it ca n't be tolerated so miami left town tonight in danger of ruining a terrific season miami won the atlantic division miami won 61 games but if the heat does not win sunday , riley and his team will be forced to watch the rest of the playoffs on television photo the magic s danny schayes , left , blocking a shot by the heat center alonzo mourning last night in game 4 \( associated press \) \( pg 10 \)
jarrell , tex , may 28 one young survivor likened the tornado to a giant bear raging across the central texas prairie a man who tried to drive away from it in his pickup truck described a black cloud hundreds of feet across , full of pieces of tin , plywood , boards , flying cows , cornstalks , bits of trees , everything you could imagine on a homemade video of the twister , a woman can be heard crying , oh , please , god , make it go away but it did not go away the cyclone that crashed down here tuesday afternoon proved to be one of the most destructive tornadoes in texas in decades , killing at least 27 people in this hamlet and unleashing a destructive force so great that dozens of homes were simply blown into oblivion nothing was left except concrete slab foundations and in a few cases , even concrete was sucked up and flung away those who miraculously survived despite having their homes hit deadon by the tornado said today almost uniformly that they were astonished to be alive to describe the devastation i thought for sure i was going to die , and i was just hoping it would happen real fast , said 43yearold virginia davidson mrs davidson said she was riding a mower on her lawn when she saw the tornado bearing down on her she ran inside , grabbed a blanket , jumped into a bathtub and pulled the blanket over her head the entire house blew apart around her , and the storm pushed her violently hundreds of feet away , eventually tossing her out of the bathtub when it passed , she was badly bruised and cut , but still alive but two of her neighbors were dead , and several others in the double creek subdivision were still missing as the deadly weather here gave way today to what seemed a cruelly beautiful spring day , authorities said that about two dozen people were unaccounted for in jarrell , a farm town where in recent years residents have begun to commute to austin , 40 miles to the south the tornado arrived almost exactly eight years after another tornado struck closer to downtown , killing 1 person and injuring 24 the latest one left large parts of the town nearly untouched but where it hit , its destruction was nearly absolute it s hard to believe you 're looking at a patch of earth where the life was literally sucked out of it , said gov george w bush of texas , who flew over the hardesthit area in a helicopter today he also met with victims and consoled other people here still waiting for word , any word , about the fate of their loved ones john johnson , the principal at the jarrell school , which is believed to have lost at least nine of its students , said i do n't know how much more simple i can make it there s simply nothing there the tornado here carried winds of more than 200 miles an hour and was one of at least six reported to have touched down in a fourcounty area of central texas from austin to waco unconfirmed sightings were reported in six additional counties the storms occurred when a cold front bumped into a mass of moistureladen lowpressure air on a muggy afternoon it was like a stick of dynamite , mark brundrett , a forecaster for the national weather service , said of the atmospheric conditions another tornado touched down in cedar park , just southwest of jarrell , resulting in the partial collapse of a supermarket a store manager who saw the tornado is credited with saving several people s lives by issuing a frantic warning over the loudspeaker to leave the building rescue crews there are still going through the rubble today , but the texas department of public safety said that no one was believed to have been killed in cedar park in jarrell though , national guard units and other rescue workers continued searching a flattened area five miles long and about a halfmile wide for signs of survivors they described a gruesome scene of numerous human body parts and dozens of dead cattle late tuesday , police had given a death toll of at least 30 in jarrell , but another count of body parts led to an adjustment today the death toll appeared likely to surpass that of the may 22 , 1987 , cyclone in saragosa , tex , that killed 30 people and injured 154 the state s two deadliest tornadoes in waco , on may 11 , 1953 , and in goliad , on may 18 , 1902 both killed 114 people almost none of the houses here had basements or underground storm cellars such shelters are more common in tornado alley , which stretches in a loose diagonal from north texas though oklahoma , kansas and into missouri tornadoes can and do , of course , strike in a much wider area i grew up going down into the cellar during frequent storm alerts , said dick sewell , an oklahoma native who owns doc s onestop , a jarrell gas station , store and restaurant where people have gathered since the tornado hit but , he said of the destruction here , i 've never seen anything like this the texas state insurance commission estimated today that the damage from the tornadoes would be 20 million to 50 million the warning siren in jarrell sounded about 10 to 12 minutes before the tornado roared through but because the hardesthit area is about two miles west of downtown , several people who lived in double creek said they did not hear the warning

no one could have known what was going through david cone s mind when he decided to remove himself from yesterday s 80 yankee victory over the texas rangers before the second inning began but plenty of people among the 42 , 002 fans and worried players on and off the field immediately thought the worst when cone walked off the yankee stadium mound and headed toward the dugout after taking a couple of warmup tosses they feared that cone had done something to the vein graft that was performed on may 10 , 1996 , to repair an aneurysm in his right shoulder paul o'neill , who watched the scene unfold from right field , said as much later somewhere in the back of cone s mind , too , was the same thought as he rode with the team doctor , stuart hershon , to columbiapresbyterian medical center in manhattan i really thought it was not related to the vein graft , cone said upon his return from the hospital but there s always that notion in the back of your mind , the uncertainty of , 'hey , i'm not an expert here maybe there could be some sort of relationship' i do n't think there is i'm pretty well convinced there is not but i'm not an expert , so maybe i should defer to the expert that would be dr george todd , who led the team of four surgeons that performed the surgery on cone todd happened to be at the hospital when cone arrived yesterday he and hershon conducted a preliminary examination in which they concluded that the pitcher is simply suffering from muscle tightness because of tendinitis in the shoulder cone did not accompany his teammates last night when they departed for a nineday west coast trip the ace of the staff will undergo further testing today , including an ultrasound to check out the vein graft and a magnetic resonance imaging exam to view the structure of cone s shoulder and rotator cuff ordinarily , the preliminary diagnosis that cone has tendinitis and would miss at least one start , according to manager joe torre , would not be considered promising but , considering all that cone has gone through the past two years , the pitcher said it s good news for me the last thing i want to hear is that there s a problem with the vein graft , because that s a career ender that said , cone vowed that he would pitch again this year he insisted he was not concerned that the soreness he had felt in his last three or four starts was related to what nearly ended his career last year cone said he asked the doctor what he would feel if the soreness were related to the vein graft and he said , immediately you 'll feel a throbbing pain , and your fingers will go numb again , and there will be a circulatory problem , cone said and i had none of those signs cone was then asked if he had had any of those signs since the surgery none , he said none whatsoever today , my pulse was great my circulation was fine he added even as we speak now , i'm not worried about it still , cone was obviously wary of what might happen if the soreness does turn out to be a result of a problem with the vein graft if the vein graft comes apart , i'm done , he said i may even lose an arm hopefully , we could get into surgery quick enough where they could stop the internal bleeding , if something like that did happen what cone does not know is when he will pitch again in his place yesterday , ramiro mendoza \( 55 \) pitched six shutout innings of twohit relief , one day after he had been shelled for three runs in the 10th inning of an 85 defeat then , kenny rogers came on to close out the game with two scoreless innings and five strikeouts that was impressive , too , considering that rogers had not pitched in a week and had almost landed on the disabled list with a bad back before he demonstrated yesterday morning that he could pitch , turning in a morethan10minute side session in the bullpen pitching in a game after doing side work is unusual rogers , meanwhile , was unhappy after being told by reporters before the game that his next start was then tentatively scheduled for saturday rogers said that the pitching coach , mel stottlemyre , had told him after his workout that he was pitching in a doubleheader wednesday instead , torre said the starters would be hideki irabu and dwight gooden i do n't even try to think along their lines , an exasperated rogers said i do n't even think they know what to do from one day to the next now , the lefthander might wind up starting on friday , which would have been cone s regular turn we 're working our way up , said rogers when told of the latest change in plans rogers said he was more worried about cone , however everybody was inside pitch one day after acquiring infielder rey sanchez from the cubs and saying he was here to back up the struggling second baseman pat kelly , the yankees placed kelly on the 15day disabled list with inflammation of a nerve in his lower left leg but , the way manager joe torre sounded , it was more for a bruised psyche the foot s been bothering him a long time , even when kelly was playing well , torre said i asked him this morning how it was and he said it bothers him when he plays then , i asked him how everything else was i just felt that pat was struggling with his confidence right now maybe the rest will help the leg and by the time september starts , we can get him back to how he was when he was playing well for us kelly , who is 4 for his last 27 , declined comment but he has become a favorite target for yankee fans as of late , and before the game torre said he felt kelly might be a little sensitive to booing sanchez went 2 for 4 in his yankee debut tim raines went 3 for 5 and drove in three runs paul o'neill also drove in three runs and hit a tworun homer into the upper deck in right

no matter what the odds say , the new england patriots have a powerful precedent on their side as they prepare for super bowl xxxi the defensive innovations put together by bill parcells and his staff and that , in turn , could mean the highscoring green bay packers will be in for the surprise of their season in 14 playoff games starting with the 1984 giants , no team facing an outfit coached by parcells has ever scored more than three touchdowns , and that total was reached only twice on six occasions , the opposition was held to 6 or points or less whether it is giant blue or patriot blue , parcells and his two key assistants , bill belichick and al groh , usually know how to shut the other team down when the postseason begins it s not what your record is it s how you 're playing now , parcells has said every day of the current playoffs to just about anyone who will listen his players have been all ears in their last two games , against two of the national football league s more potent offenses , the steelers and jaguars , the patriots have yielded a grand total of three field goals what people overlook is that there were three defensive coordinators on the giants and now on the patriots , the former giants linebacker harry carson said yesterday , referring to who else \? parcells , groh and the cerebral belichick carson was a key figure in the 1987 super bowl victory the giants' first in that game , the giants gave up 10 points in the first quarter to john elway and the broncos but then shut them down until the final moments of the game parcells pays close attention to the defining moments of a team s season one of his close friends is bobby knight , indiana s legendary basketball coach knight has always preached that the most important thing is to get to the playoff tournament , and to peak at the same time parcells always keeps in mind his team s november and december schedule , and he uses those games to revise defensive formulas that may have worked imperfectly in the first part of the season the changes he makes carry over to the postseason and in the last 11 playoff games parcells has coached , none of his teams have given up more than two touchdowns the current patriots squad seems to be following the same pattern since being blown out at home by the broncos , 348 , in midnovember , the patriots have allowed the opposition just 73 points in 7 games not only that , they have not allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters , including the two playoff games parcells , belichick and groh \( who joined up with parcells the year before the giants' 1990 super bowl season \) have called the shots , and the players have done the rest belichick was parcells s defensive coordinator during the giants' big years , and rejoined him this season as assistant head coach following five seasons as the browns' head man groh has been the patriots' defensive coordinator since parcells took over in 1993 he was a linebackers coach with the giants , and then the defensive coordinator after parcells and belichick left interestingly , the one time parcells did not have belichick with him in a playoff game , he lost belichick was on the other sideline coaching the browns , who beat the patriots , 2013 , in a wildcard game in the 1994 yes , the patriots have been lucky at times in these playoffs but is n't there always a bit of that \? of more significance , is that the patriots' defense held the steelers' top runner , the burly jerome bettis , to a mere 43 yards in their 283 victory two sundays ago and repeated that same low number last sunday against the equally burly natrone means of the jaguars as a defensive unit , the patriots went into the playoffs without a particularly imposing reputation but they have come up with any number of surprises the patriots blitzed more than we thought they would , jaguars quarterback mark brunell said after his team was held without a touchdown last sunday they brought a lot of different looks it was a matter of seeing it , adjusting to it we started to handle it better , but then they backed off and went into a twodeep zone we were unable to adjust to it different looks carson recalled the national conference championship game between the giants and redskins in january 1987 belichick designed new jobs for carson and his fellow linebacker pepper johnson to deal with washington s breadandbutter counter run bill got the inside linebackers to go into a threepoint stance , but only to knock the offensive linemen off stride so they could n't block , carson said the redskins never adjusted no , indeed the giants won , 170 four years later , in super bowl xxv , the giants had to confront the highintensity , nohuddle offense of the buffalo bills belichick had his staff members put together a onehour , realtime tape of the bills he discovered that a key to their offense was not that they dashed into formation and snapped the ball , but that they quickly lined up and then waited most offenses get set and hike the ball in five or six seconds jim kelly would bring the bills to the line , then make the defense wait 9 or 10 seconds in their stance , muscles tensed and getting tired until he finally called for the ball the giants' defense , though , was able to practice for those moments and held the bills in check unlike those giants , the present patriots have no widely acclaimed defensive stars five patriots are going to the pro bowl all from the offense but none of that will matter if the patriot defense keeps doing its job photo lawrence taylor and bill parcells talking defense in 1986 the patriot defense swarming natrone means sunday \( photographs by barton silverman the new york times \)
trenton , feb 22 ending months of speculation that he wanted his old job back , former gov jim florio said today that he would not seek the democratic gubernatorial nomination but that he would do all that he could to defeat gov christine todd whitman in november mr florio said in an interview that he had given serious consideration to a rematch with mrs whitman because he had believed that his fellow new jersey democrats were not making a strong enough case against whitman administration policies , which he said threaten the state s economic future but after watching the field of six potential democratic challengers over the last couple of months , and meeting with them privately during the last two weeks , mr florio said he is now convinced that the other candidates can successfully draw attention to the longterm problems that he believes governor whitman s policies have created he said he can be more effective by stepping aside and lending his support to one candidate , representative robert e andrews , a democrat from camden county , who he said would be able to wage the most aggressive campaign without exception , all of them are good people , mr florio said of the field of contenders they are smart people they are attractive people i am enthusiastic about the energy that some of the candidates have but what you need is all of those things and a commitment to be extremely aggressive about highlighting the differences between the whitman administration and what i hope would be the consensus policies of the democratic nominee and the democratic party i am now convinced that candidate is rob andrews although mr florio had never publicly declared his intention to challenge mrs whitman , he did not dismiss a possible campaign until today the prospect of a whitmanflorio rematch had been the subject of much talk and concern in new jersey democratic circles democrats , who lost control of the state legislature and hundreds of municipal and county seats after mr florio pushed through a 28 billion tax increase in 1990 , feared that a rematch would revive voter anger over the tax hikes at a time when they were seeking to rebuild the party and field the next generation of democrats there was not a trace of ambivalence in mr florio s voice as he described his decision to withdraw from the race and throw his support behind mr andrews , who took over the congressional seat that mr florio left in 1989 to become governor i am very comfortable and assured to have somebody who can carry a good message , he said mr andrews will benefit not only from mr florio s continued popularity among rankandfile democratic voters but also because he no longer has to worry about sharing the same political base in south jersey with mr florio in an interview , mr andrews said that he welcomed mr florio s support i'm obviously delighted and honored , mr andrews said mr andrews said he also believed that mr florio s decision increased the chances of unifying the state democratic party i believe that we will have a unified party very soon , and get on to the business of pointing out the reasons why governor whitman should be denied a second term , he said a poll by quinnipiac college , published last week , showed that mr florio , with his statewide name recognition , could have easily won the democratic gubernatorial nomination in june , but that mrs whitman would trounce him in november now that mr florio has withdrawn from the race , mr andrews , who is 39 , and state senator james e mcgreevey , 37 , a democrat from middlesex county who is also the mayor of woodbridge township , are considered the frontrunners in race for the democratic nomination mr mcgreevey praised mr florio , saying that he deserves enormous respect , but he dismissed the former governor s assertion that mr andrews would make a stronger case against governor whitman than he would he also said his background as a mayor , rather than as a member of congress , would make him a more effective governor mr andrews and governor florio are both from camden county and shared the same congressional district , he said as a mayor , your results are measured on a daybyday basis it is not casting a particular vote it is by delivering a product , which is more relevant to the challenges in the governor s office other democrats who have declared candidacies include robert c janiszewski , the hudson county executive susan bass levin , the mayor of cherry hill michael murphy , a former morris county prosecutor and george zoffinger , a former state commerce commissioner since the democratic candidates all lack experience in a statewide campaign and are little known outside of their home counties , they share the problem of building name recognition among voters we are all essentially known in our own area and not beyond this makes it a very hot , even contest , mr janiszewski said mrs whitman , who was unavailable for comment today because she was in california , finishing a fourday trip to raise more than 100 , 000 in campaign funds for the new jersey republican committee , has said she would relish a rematch with mr florio so she could compare her record of cutting taxes with his tax increases mrs whitman narrowly defeated mr florio after a bitter campaign in 1993 close friends and associates of mr florio said they believed he had wanted to challenge her this year to vindicate his policies but mr florio insists he was motivated by his concern that mrs whitman s fiscal policies along with her approach to the environment , property taxes and the public schools were creating longterm problems for the state in the next economic downturn , he said , new jersey will be without the resources needed to get through difficult times because of the governor s policies of the last three years the policies of this administration are nothing less than irresponsible , mr florio said but to this point , none of this stuff has pierced through the clutter of public discussion it is going to take a herculean effort to mix passion , force and knowledge of the substance of the issues to uncloak what has been done i am confident that the message will get across but does this mean that mr florio will be stepping out of the public eye and retiring from politics forever \? i am not going away , he said photo

an animated discussion about the imminent arrival of hideki irabu occurred five feet from kenny rogers s locker yesterday as a curious andy pettitte peppered a reporter with questions about what the japanese pitcher s contract might be worth , when he might join the yankees and if he would replace one of the starters in the rotation but rogers never blinked as the conversation unfolded near him he continued to fiddle with a video game maybe he was in a typical pregame trance and drowned out the chatter or perhaps he does not care about irabu maybe he should start caring and maybe the yankees should be worried about slipsliding away after a humbling 106 loss to the baltimore orioles last night elbowed them to their seventh setback in eight games and left them in the rubble of their worst homestand in 28 years following another lackluster performance by the predictably unpredictable rogers , it is reasonable to speculate that he could be jettisoned to the bullpen if irabu is eventually tossed into the rotation george steinbrenner , who has been critical of rogers , might demand that irabu start games and that could leave rogers as the first 20 million middle reliever in baseball history when asked about his insecure status once irabu joins the team , or once dwight gooden is activated , rogers replied , it does n't bother me one bit i do n't control this place , rogers said i just do my business if you get caught up in the other garbage , it s a waste of time rogers froze with runners on base and permitted a mammoth threerun homer to jeffrey hammonds in the second inning a twoout , tworun single to pete incaviglia in the third , and another crushing tworun single to incaviglia in the fifth unlike pettitte , who pitches better in dangerous situations , rogers tends to melt like a snow cone in an oven whenever there is trouble he did it again last night while being bombed for nine runs \( six earned \) and six hits in four and onethird innings he has one victory in his last six starts and skidded to 33 there s no explanation i stunk , rogers said i could n't get the ball where i wanted to because rogers crumbled in three of his five innings while surrendering 5 hits in 10 atbats with orioles on , because scott kamieniecki \( 42 \) had enough stuff to thwart his former team on two earned runs in five innings and because the heart of the yankee lineup failed to capitalize fully with the bases loaded and none out in the eighth , new york spiraled to a 16 record on the homestand and plummeted 8 games behind the firstplace orioles it is the yankees' worst record for a homestand seven games or longer since they were 17 from april 28 to may 4 , 1969 no doubt about it , david cone said this was a dreadful , disappointing homestand while it is easy for the yankees to say there are 112 games left on the schedule , it is also easy to remember that the 1996 champions never drifted out of first place after april 30 and never trailed by more than 4 games you 're always concerned , said manager joe torre , as the yankees teetered closer to 500 at 2624 but it s too early to panic when the yankees spanked baltimore in 14 of 18 regular and postseason games last season , they were the deliriously successful bunch that formula has officially been scrapped after the orioles resoundingly swept a twogame series at yankee stadium , nudging new york to third place in the american league east maybe fate will smile down on the orioles this year , said baltimore manager davey johnson not surprisingly , baltimore s threerun second began when rogers walked rafael palmeiro and hit cal ripken in the left knee the orioles' fiverun fifth was initiated when rogers walked roberto alomar rogers created his own messes and could not tidy up tino martinez walloped his 18th homer into the rightfield upper deck in the third to trim the deficit to 52 , but kamieniecki did his best work in the fourth when he whiffed bernie williams on a 12 curveball with the bases loaded to leave the yankees exasperated and escalate the doubts about their lethargic play we have n't deserved to win games , torre said we have n't put it all together inside pitch because george steinbrenner wants a provision that enables the yankees to receive 50 percent of hideki irabu s endorsement money , the agreement between new york and the japanese pitcher has been delayed while the players association and the player relations committee review the contract if the provision is allowed , irabu will get a fouryear contract for 14 million if not , he will receive about 13 million brian boehringer was put on the 15day disabled list because of inflammation in his right elbow from a floating bone chip that he has had since 1993 danny rios , a 24yearold righthander who was 43 with a 473 earned run average at class aaa columbus , was recalled baltimore s jimmy key , who won the decisive game of the world series with the yankees , was presented with his ring by joe torre

innsbruck , austria another giant tunnel \? europe must be kidding after the financial debacle of the english channel tunnel construction costs of 15 billion , double the original estimate , and a 14 billion mountain of debt you might think it would be a while before anyone in europe considered digging a new one think again while no one is rushing to break ground soon , railway executives and financial planners in germany , austria and italy are studying the possibility of drilling a railway tunnel under the lofty brenner pass , on austria s alpine frontier with italy at 33 miles , it would be two miles longer than the channel tunnel , and its cost is also put at 15 billion before it joined the european union in 1995 , austria sought to appease its powerful domestic environmental movement by restricting truck traffic on the highway that crosses the brenner as a condition of joining the bloc , though , austria agreed to phase out those curbs in return , the european union agreed to promote a project to lure freight from the roads by upgrading existing railways across the alps basically , by putting most of them underground the motivation is clear as europe strives to integrate its economies , the austrian alps have the effrontery to lie smack between two of the continent s most economically dynamic regions southern germany and northeastern italy the brenner project , in fact , is only one piece of a broad european plan to create more ways to get goods across the mountains but at the same time protect the region s natural beauty from industrial encroachment switzerland , though not a european union member , is under pressure to upgrade its alpine routes , and in 1995 the swiss approved the digging of not just one but two railway tunnels under the alps , through the gotthard and lotschberg massifs , at a total estimated cost of almost 12 billion in france , plans are afoot for a tunnel that would pierce the mont cenis massif to link southeastern france and northwestern italy you have three major projects the gotthard , mont cenis in france and the brenner and they 're all aimed essentially to facilitate the shift of freight traffic from road to rail , said john d kramer , an american investment banker who advises the austrian government none of this will happen immediately , though if the brenner tunnel is dug , construction is not likely to begin before 2000 passenger and freight trains would not pass through it until 10 years later and huge obstacles remain for one thing , environmental groups oppose the idea , arguing that a tunnel would drag even more industrial traffic into the alps and it is far from clear that the backers can raise the construction money needed especially considering the european penchant for going first class on such projects the brenner tunnel is to be a joint effort of austria , italy and germany yet germany , burdened with the costs of unification , says it has little spare cash , and italy says that without the germans , it , too , might have second thoughts still , many experts say the brenner project makes good sense the european union s chief transport official , neil kinnock , has made it a top priority and while the brenner , at 4 , 495 feet the lowest of the alpine passes , has been a favorite crossing point since roman times , winter snows and summer mudslides often cause shippers long and costly delays , with one recent landslide closing part of the highway for four days the brenner is also crucial for traffic between italy and eastern europe , which is expected to increase sharply in coming years such a tunnel cannot be seen just as an internal austrian affair , said lorenz fritz , general secretary of the association of austrian industry in vienna it has to be seen in a regional european setting and mr kramer said , the underlying social and economic rationale for the brenner project , i think , is clear indeed , such a huge infrastructure project is a natural in a culture that puts great weight in building for the centuries but in an age when governments across europe are scrambling to cut spending to meet the requirements of a single currency , it will not be easy so the planners of the brenner tunnel sought to inject a dash of yankee frugality , engaging american investment banks like goldman , sachs and salomon brothers to see whether and how such a project might be financed they also hired louis berger international , a unit of the new jerseybased louis berger engineering group , to explore ways of designing the tunnel and organizing its construction that might result in a lower cost the aim , said hans lindenberger , chief executive of brenner eisenbahn gmbh , which was set up by the austrians to oversee the work , is a stepbystep approach aimed at avoiding the channel tunnel s mistakes this is not a monster project , as it s often described , mr lindenberger said monster or no , the brenner project s dimensions are daunting in addition to the tunnel , which could itself cost 45 billion or so , 245 miles of track are to be upgraded between munich , in southern germany , and the northern italian city of verona
cape town , july 8 the four young men who were convicted of killing amy biehl , an american fulbright scholar who was chased , stoned and then stabbed to death in a black township in 1993 , apologized to her family today as they sought amnesty for her killing the four had laughed and joked throughout their trials , maintaining they were innocent but today , looking somber , and hoping for amnesty from south africa s truth and reconciliation commission , they detailed their roles in the killing much of the hearing focused on the motivation of the four , who are each serving 18year prison terms for the slaying to win amnesty , they need to persuade the commission that their motive for killing ms biehl , an antiapartheid activist who was driving three black friends home , was political and not merely racist the truth commission , set up 18 months ago to investigate the atrocities of the apartheid past , has received about 8 , 000 applications for amnesty the panel is still in the early stages of considering these pleas , but several recent rulings suggest that it will be extremely generous in granting amnesty for politically motivated acts of violence the hearing was postponed once so that ms biehl s parents , peter and linda , could attend today , they sat quietly in the front row as the parents of the young men came in , the biehls shook hands with each one and mr biehl said repeatedly we are parents too we are in solidarity with you we are not opposing amnesty but when a statement by one of the young men graphically described his role in the murder , mr biehl wiped tears from his eyes the four convicted men mzikhona nofemela , vusumzi ntamo , ntobeko peni and mongezi manqina , all now in their early 20 s said in statements to the commission that the killing was part of their larger aim to win south africa back for the black majority but none of the men has much education , and one , mr ntamo , said , i am not able to properly articulate any political ideology or motivation for my conduct the four described in their statements chasing ms biehl across a street after her car was stopped by a crowd of youths who were revved up after attending a political rally someone in the crowd had thrown a brick through her windshield and , bleeding from a head wound , she tried to flee her friends tried to persuade the crowd that she was a comrade but were pushed aside mr manqina said he had tripped ms biehl and delivered what he believed was the fatal knife wound while she lay on the ground and dozens of others surrounded her , throwing bricks and stones mr manqina apologized in his statement , which was read by his lawyer but under questioning he insisted that the event might have served a purpose south africa is free today because of the bloodshed , he said mr peni said he had realized later that ms biehl , 26 and just days from going home , was trying to help south africa s blacks and said he regretted having taken part in killing her i realize it was bad , he said i ask amy s parents to forgive me just to hear they have forgiven me would mean a great deal to me the biehls , who live in california , have prepared a statement for the commission , which they intend to read on wednesday , at the end of the hearing they declined to say anything about the proceedings before then

every economist gets used to the ridicule we peddle the dismal science we know the price of everything , but the value of nothing two economists produce three conflicting opinions but now , courtesy of researchers at harvard , comes news that it is the economists who think the nation is in fine shape and everyone else who predicts doom and gloom to a practitioner , this turnabout feels good the dismal science crack came from thomas carlyle , reacting in part to the late18thcentury nostrums of thomas malthus , who predicted that population growth would eventually drive wages down to starvation levels in the process , rents would rise , making landlords rich and planting the seeds of ferocious , unending class warfare it was definitely a dismal vision it was also spectacularly wrong yet every few years another group of economists resurrects the malthusian vision , reestablishing economists' reputation as doomsayers but the economists' gloomy reputation goes beyond these malthusians we compulsively remind people to eat their spinach where others fantasize about the benefits from this or that government subsidy or regulation , we wallow miserably in contemplation of the costs ordinary human beings ponder the beauty of perfectly clean air over the grand canyon economists calculate the extra dollars it would cost to remove 1 percent of the ozone that fouls the air the profession , in short , is methodologically small bore , and rarely exhilarating but perhaps all that is changing the poll by harvard , the henry j kaiser family foundation and the washington post shows massive role reversal almost 30 percent of the ordinary public thinks that living standards will fall over the next five years but and pay attention here less than 10 percent of economists agree in the survey , no economists believe that technology hurts the economy \( who says no two ever agree \? \) by contrast , nearly onefifth of the general public thinks that technology actually hurts indeed , economists nowadays seemingly see good everywhere almost 90 percent think trade makes us richer , and over half even think downsizing is good for the economy almost a third of the public fears trade and a large majority condemns downsizing one possible explanation for this odd switch is that the public is often misled by gloomy and outdated information at the time of the survey , 1996 , unemployment was at a 7year low and inflation at a 30year low but many citizens did not know these facts less than a third of the public knew that the economy had been recovering and adding jobs seventy percent of the public , but only about 20 percent of the economists , believed , incorrectly , that family living standards had been on the decline i have to admit , however , that an alternative explanation of these figures strengthens the canard that economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing economists take solace from the numbers average incomes are rising but because of soaring inequality that concentrates winnings in relatively few hands , many families see little or none of the gain the economists are right on the numbers , but the families may be right on the facts ok , so we may have made another mistake at least this time , we are the ones who are smiling michael m weinstein
in spring my idea of a good book changes considerably i do n't want verbal pictures to activate the inner eye but actual ones that lead me , literally , out of doors i want clear images and crisp descriptions as close as possible to the living birds i'm looking for i 've been birdwatching for only a few years , but it did n't take long for the passion to take hold or , once it did , for the field guide to become one of my favorite forms of literature of course literature is a big word for a little book whose chief virtue is that it fits into your back pocket but the field guide embodies , for all its modesty , an ancient urge to order the world it pairs the mythic impulse , as old as adam , to name the animals with the modern scientific need to codify and condense it leads you into the wild and then gratifies the civilized fantasy of reading the world , of turning nature itself into a book the father of the modern bird guide was indisputably roger tory peterson , who died last year at the age of 88 in 1934 , peterson published a field guide to the birds , which for the first time employed his famous system of diagnostic marks , arrows pointing to the telltale differences among birds so that they could be named at a glance in the field the book was in part the product of technological advances in binoculars before that , as peterson noted in his introduction , the ornithologist of the old school seldom accepted a sight record unless it was made along the barrel of a shotgun even a casual glance at the journals of john james audubon , the first great painter of american avian life , bears this out during a walk this afternoon a beautiful mississippi kite sailed by me unfortunately i had no gun , reads a typical entry in the naturalist s diary even more typically had the good fortune to kill a beautiful marsh hawk peterson made birdwatching more like reading a book or rather , more like reading two books one the printed guide in your hand , the other the fluttering , wild , mysterious world around you peterson s field guide was not expected to do well , but it sold out its first printing of 2 , 000 copies in a matter of weeks it has since been through four editions , sold over 55 million copies and inspired a whole generation of field guides \( to honor the life of peterson , houghton mifflin recently published a facsimile of that first edition \) in his 1852 journal , henry david thoreau complained that the naturalists and poets he admired had recorded their work not on the bark of trees but in books he had to find in the libraries of cities like cambridge or boston , places so strange and repulsive both to them and me that the trip seemed too great a price to pay for access even to the works of homer , or chaucer or linnaeus audubon s great book the birds of america , printed in the aptly named double elephant folio , stood over three feet high thoreau would have appreciated peterson , a book that went into the field with you for christmas red gave me a field guide to birds' by r t peterson have you ever seen it \? the poet elizabeth bishop wrote enthusiastically to her friend marianne moore in 1941 i think it is marvelous and very different to most bird books the pictures give the birds as they look at a distance and in all stages of age and molting , etc if you have n't seen it , will you please let me get you a copy \? the descriptive writing is quite good and different , too writers have always had a special relationship to birds after all , birds do naturally what poets dream of they sing they mediate between land and sky , between the earthbound body and the airborne soul birds have always held out the promise of higher knowledge , of poetic truth , of transcendence in isaac babel s short story awakening , the 14yearold narrator , imprisoned by his father s dream of making him a violin prodigy and by a jewish childhood chained to the gemara , skips his violin lessons to hang out at the odessa seashore he is befriended by a local watergod , yefim nikitich smolich , in whose breast there dwelt compassion for jewish children nikitich reads the scribblings of the young narrator and informs him that without a sense of nature he will never become a writer he would seize me by the shoulder when a bird flew past , and he made me listen to the various kinds of singing what bird is that singing \? ' i knew none of the answers the names of trees and birds , their division into species , where birds fly away to , on which side the sun rises , when the dew falls thickest all these things were unknown to me and you dare to write ! ' by the story s end , the narrator , caught and dragged back to the bosom of his father s wishes , is led through a moonless night , listening to birds that he cannot name as he dreams of running away birds for babel were simultaneously symbols of the natural world and of the literary world he hoped to enter that contradictory longing has always been part of bird lore the dream of ascending , as keats said to his nightingale , on the viewless wings of poesy , while remaining grounded in the natural world as well
in its day , the 500pound castiron mushroom in front of 1621 mermaid avenue was a modern miracle , a highpressure fire hydrant capable of delivering 3 , 000 gallons of water a minute on one of coney island s main commercial streets its day , however , ended nearly two decades ago , after the city shut down the pumping stations that powered highpressure hydrants because pumper trucks had made them obsolete since then , the hydrant like 240 others around coney island and thousands elsewhere in new york city has sat forlorn and useless , at least when it comes to fighting fires but the orphaned hydrant on mermaid avenue is still active as far as the city s parking enforcers are concerned , occupying what would otherwise be a prime spot in front of the island delights restaurant motorists who park in front of it risk 55 tickets but early next month at least 17 years since water last surged from a highpressure hydrant in new york city , 11 years after a city study recommended getting rid of the hydrants and 4 years after the city promised speedy removal workers armed with jackhammers and saws will begin removing coney island s dormant hydrants , at a cost of about 2 , 700 apiece basically , we do n't think it s taken so long , said cathy dellicarpini , a spokeswoman for the city department of environmental protection , which maintains the hydrants this project has been in the planning and implementation phase for quite some time now the crews could not come too soon for horace thomas , the manager of island delights , who said yesterday that customers often doubleparked , and were ticketed , rather than park in front of the hydrant it s a shame , he said yesterday either fix it or take it away , but do n't give people a ticket if the hydrant is no good the coney island project is part of a threephase plan to remove more than 3 , 300 defunct highpressure hydrants around the city in the first phase , in 1995 and 1996 , crews removed 819 hydrants in downtown brooklyn by far the biggest portion of the job is the removal of the 2 , 400 dead hydrants dotting manhattan south of 34th street , where parking is often scarcer than it is in coney island the city is scheduled to solicit bids for that job next spring and the removal would take about 18 months to complete matthew monahan , a spokesman for the city department of design and construction , which is overseeing the removal project for the department of environmental protection , said that removing the hydrants is not simply a matter of sending a crew out on a truck to yank them out like so many weeds the city must survey the hydrants , draw up plans and maps for their removal , find money in the budget for the job and solicit bids once the contract is awarded , workers would have to dig up the sidewalk and cut the hydrants off two feet below the surface , cap the exposed pipe , pile filler material around it , lay new concrete and remove manhole covers in the street mr monahan said the manhattan hydrants are being done last because the job is the most complicated in addition to ripping out the hydrants , workers will clean and reline about 3 , 400 feet of highpressure water mains which have been unused since the late 1950 s to adapt them to low pressure , at a cost expected to be about 6 million , he said the highpressure hydrants , which are thicker than standard hydrants and sport a flattish cap rather than a steeply tapered , umbrellaribbed cap , were installed between 1908 and 1914 in response to the great baltimore fire of 1904 , according to a 1986 report by the department of environmental protection in manhattan , officials were afraid that the dry goods district between chambers and 23d streets was vulnerable to a similar blaze officials in coney island , then one of the world s most popular resorts , felt a highpressure system would better protect its numerous amusement parks one of which , dreamland , burnt to the ground in 1911 as well as architectural landmarks like a 122foottall hotel shaped like an elephant in downtown brooklyn , the hydrants were deemed necessary because of the relatively tall buildings by 1930 , the city s fire stations all had pumper trucks , which could boost the pressure from a standard hydrant and made highpressure hydrants redundant the city abandoned the pumping stations in 1957 , but the highpressure hydrants were used like standard hydrants until about 1980 , when a lack of replacement parts made them impossible to maintain the dead hydrants sat mostly forgotten until 1993 , when the city councilman in downtown brooklyn , kenneth k fisher , campaigned for their removal the promises from the fledgling administration of mayor rudolph w giuliani to remove the hydrants were followed by more than two years of planning actually , the hydrants still have some function , if only remotely related to their original purpose some are still connected to the mains and leak steadily on surf

more parking spots i'm glad to see them go none of these factors meant much to chun cho , the owner of the mermaid variety store , which is two doors down from island delights on mermaid avenue mr cho

washington , april 11 in the first wideranging foreign policy address of his second term , president clinton today called on the united states to play a more active role in the world he urged congress to approve a treaty banning chemical weapons and to give him enhanced authority to reach a trade agreement with chile the decisions we make in the next few months will set america s course in the world for the next 50 years , mr clinton said declaring that there is no illusory olympus on which the world s only superpower can sit , he repeatedly called in his 25minute speech for engagement in an increasingly interdependent world mr clinton is becoming more engaged in world affairs in his second term , his aides say , as he becomes more experienced and confident in dealing with other leaders he is also facing a barrage of tests of his leadership on foreign policy , overseas and in congress here , he must win support on issues from the chemical weapons ban and free trade agreement to paying longowed american dues to the united nations , renewing china s favorable trading status and expanding nato what we see is a very intense period of foreign policy activity coming up over the next couple of months , one white house official said you need to have kind of an internationalist core in the public and the congress to sustain this kind of an agenda the official said that mr clinton had been pleased with recent negotiations with congress over certifying mexico as a partner in fighting drugs and in pursuing ratification of the chemical weapons ban he s really discovered that if you roll up your sleeves and engage with them on this , there s a willingness to examine the issues , and open your mind to why the administration is doing what it s doing , the official said foreign policy also permits mr clinton to change the subject from questions about whitewater and democratic campaign finances , an ability he strikingly demonstrated today in giving his speech to the american society of newspaper editors in a banquet hall full of editors the sort of people who have assigned correspondents to dig into the lingering charges against the president none posed a question about whitewater or campaign finances they asked mostly about foreign policy instead president clinton himself poked fun at the extremes he will go to divert reporters from writing about fundraising in a speech here to broadcast correspondents on thursday night announce that i will fight evander holyfield , mr clinton said , offering one fictional gambit anytime , anyplace his aides say that president clinton is concerned that isolationist sentiment is rising in the united states today , he strongly argued against such thinking it is commonplace to say that since the end of the cold war , america stands alone as the world s only superpower , he said that is clearly true , but it can be dangerously misleading because our power can only be used if we are willing to become even more involved with others looking ahead to a series of international meetings , from a visit to mexico next month to a nato summit in madrid in july , president clinton warned , the powerful trend toward democracy and free markets is neither inevitable nor irreversible mr clinton called the chemical weapons ban and the free trade agreement pressing tests of american leadership the ban , the chemical weapons convention , prohibits developing , making , stockpiling or using chemical weapons already ratified by 70 nations , it takes effect on april 29 even if the senate does not approve it , the treaty will impose restrictions on the exports of american chemical companies and subject them to possible penalties
the adirondacks a history of america s first wilderness by paul schneider illustrated 368 pp new york a john macrae book henry holt company 25 if wilderness were , as it is navely supposed to be , simply land untouched by anyone other than noble savages or huntergatherers , this book would have to end almost before it begins perhaps it could simply state that from time immemorial trees fell in upstate new york and no one heard them but the point of the adirondacks a history of america s first wilderness , which in fact is a thoroughly readable and entertaining tour of more than 300 years in the history of what is now the adirondack park , is the paradoxical notion that wilderness is not only a human invention but a new york invention the argument is well conceived the notion of preserving forest and stream appeared early in this part of the country the tradition of ecotourism here , paul schneider writes , goes back at least as far as ralph waldo emerson s 1858 camping trip to follensby pond the famous philosophers' camp' of course this was not ecotourism as we know it apparently emerson and louis agassiz spent some of their spare time on this trip shooting their rifles at empty ale bottles government was on the preservationist path early as well the new york forest preserve was created in 1885 , and it led to the formation of the adirondack park in 1892 in 1894 the new york constitution enshrined the provision that the lands of the forest preserve shall be forever kept as wild forest lands now the park includes six million acres of mixed public and private land and , in addition to being a great resource for lovers of the mountains and woods , is an endless source of argument over how restricted the private land should be but the adirondacks is not primarily about politics , or philosophy mr schneider , who has written for such publications as audubon and esquire , is first and foremost a teller of tales his book is a roughly chronological , swiftly readable account of indians and trappers , redcoats , hermits , magnates , reprobates and esthetes it also drops the most interesting names almost everyone who spent any time in the adirondacks is mentioned here john brown , j p morgan , william james , maxim gorky to pick a few this approach is all to the good on a purely selfish level , i find mr schneider s stories immensely satisfying my family and i have spent parts of the last 20 summers in the adirondacks when you vacation there or live there year round , the lore can become almost as fascinating as the mountains , lakes and streams themselves and on a more principled note , it seems only right , if this wilderness is a human invention , that the people have pride of place in its story the book is billed as a history , but it might be thought of as a biography of a place , a life of the adirondacks it starts with the arrival of europeans on the boundaries of what is now the park and tracks subsequent periods of fur trapping , mining , logging and vacationing this history is interspersed with vignettes from the present day , when logging and trapping still go on , and when the current vision of unspoiled wilderness is achieved , in part , by destroying old camps and poisoning unwanted fish to make the woods and ponds like new again , with certifiably native brook trout none of this is particularly new , and mr schneider acknowledges that he has drawn on a wealth of writing about the adirondacks , but the park s story comes to life in his hands for one thing , he has an eye for detail when europeans first encountered the mountains in the early 17th century , he writes , the region was well enough traveled by the people of the iroquois confederacy that commonly used paths , like one from the raquette river to the saranac lakes , were worn a foot or more deep by centuries of foot traffic mr schneider pins down the way the adirondacks drew society and money to the area in one sentence the price of admission on the st regis lakes by the middle of the gay nineties was better than 4 , 000 an acre he is speaking here not of the truly rich but of the second wave of money and he has peopled his history with one remarkable character after another , quickly and deftly drawn one such is william johnson , who arrived from ireland in the early 18th century to oversee an uncle s holdings in the heart of iroquois land johnson learned to speak mohawk , sometimes dressed in a breech cloth , joined in indian ceremonies and games , and defended the interests of the mohawks while making sure that they continued to kill the french johnson drank , and lived , like a lord he kept slaves , played host to hundreds of mohawks at a time and employed three dwarfs , two as waiters and one , billy , as a dinnertime violinist he may have been the first wealthy man to have summer houses in what is now the park two of them on occasion he had his valet , pontioch , row him down the sacandaga river while billy provided fiddle music and johnson fished and shot ducks later , in the 19th century , the requisite sturdy and vicious white trappers appear nat foster , for instance , who made a habit of killing indians and was never convicted , or william wood , who lost his feet one winter when they froze but managed to attach snowshoes to his stumps and kept right on trapping the countless facts are irresistible in the middle of the 19th century , mr schneider writes , a good lumberjack cut about 20 trees in a 15hour day and was paid 75 cents a day forty loggers in one camp ate 400 hardboiled eggs at a sitting lucy carnegie spent 200 , 000 to remodel her camp in 1902 vice president theodore roosevelt was lunching near the top of mt marcy when a guide rushed out of the woods with a telegram president mckinley , who had been shot by an anarchist the week before , had taken an unexpected turn for the worse secretary of war henry stimson was at the ausable club in keene valley when the enola gay dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima i do have one small worry about these facts , which arises from my surprise at reading that fishing for trout in the waters of the private adirondack mountain reserve is strictly catch and release since i have cooked and eaten some of those very trout , i checked this statement with one of the members of the committee that sets the regulations the point is minor , but mr schneider just plain got it wrong i hope it was a rare mistake there is a particular waterfall in the high peaks region of the park that is my favorite place on the planet above the falls parts of the bank are solid rock , and in the rock are a few old iron spikes , probably a legacy from a logging chute the waterfall is clearly not pristine , not untouched but the way it has been touched adds poignancy and richness to the place , a human history as well as natural beauty in describing the logging business at its peak mr schneider writes , there was no forest , really , only trees without the people and their stories , without the lore , without iron spikes in a brook s rocky bank , there might be a forest , but there would be no adirondacks photos above ,

major work by mr hockney to enter the museum s collection and will be on view in the photography galleries when the getty opens while most departments of the getty collect only works made before 1900 , photography is the exception that department , with 65 , 000 photographs dating from the 1830 s to the present , is one of the most comprehensive collections of american and european photography in the world the museum bought the photocollage for an undisclosed sum from the artist s dealer , peter goulds of the la louver gallery in los angeles we are making a special effort to focus on the work of california artists and particularly artists from the los angeles area , said deborah gribbon , associate director and chief curator at the getty we are also interested in the photographic work of artists who are primarily painters weston naef , the museum s curator of photographs , added that pearblossom hwy would be quite at home in the museum s collection , which has photographs by such painters as edgar degas , thomas eakins , charles sheeler , andy warhol and sigmar polke a mounted mosaic of more than 700 photographs , the hockney work depicts the pearblossom highway \( route 138

collection the works will be shown from sept 18 through jan 13 in the show ellsworth kelly 15 works on paper , 19491958 the group was a partial gift from the artist and a partial purchase , although the museum declined to discuss the cost when i arrived here three years ago , said margit rowell , chief curator in the modern s department of drawings , i was surprised to find that a number of american artists who are classic were not as well represented as they should be ms rowell knows mr kelly and had seen the works on paper at the jeu de paume in paris several years ago i went to see ellsworth and persuaded him that it was important for these works to be in a major museum , she said the drawings represent what is considered the artist s best period for works on paper while the modern has nine paintings and six sculptures by mr kelly , none of its few works of his on paper were classically ellsworth , ms rowell said moves and openings it s been a busy summer for architects

pbhg funds , one of the bestperforming mutual fund companies of the 1990 s , has suffered shareholder redemptions of more than 6 percent of the company s assets in recent weeks , as the performance of its funds has dropped sharply at some of the company s funds , the withdrawals have been even larger for example , shareholders of the pbhg select equity fund have withdrawn an estimated 185 percent of assets since the beginning of february , or 87 million of the fund s 472 million in assets , according to amg data services of arcata , calif through yesterday , the select equity fund had lost 131 percent of its value since the beginning of the year , a dramatic setback after gaining 28 percent in 1996 the experience of the pbhg funds raises some potentially troubling questions for the fund industry , which insists its historical data prove that fund investors do not redeem , or cash out , their holdings when performance turns down but many new shareholders have started buying into mutual funds in the last five years when the stock market has not suffered a broad downturn calling into question whether past experience will hold true in the future the reversal at pbhg is particularly stunning because the company s funds have been so successful its largest fund , pbhg growth , was the bestperforming general equity fund of the 1990 s through the end of last year but this year 11 of pbhg s 12 equity funds have lost money , in part because the volatile technology stocks in which the funds specialize have fallen out of favor the losses have led shareholders to withdraw 4803 million , or 62 percent of the company s assets , since the beginning of february , according to amg at the end of january , the pbhg funds managed 81 billion , according to amg gary pilgrim , chief investment officer at pilgrim baxter associates , the firm in wayne , pa , that manages the pbhg funds , said in an interview that none of the funds had been forced to sell stocks to pay shareholders for their redemptions but he acknowledged that there had been a steady erosion in the balance of money flowing out of the funds the declines at the pbhg funds have been accelerated in part by pilgrim baxter s investment style typically , the firm takes large positions in small , lightly traded stocks , often making it one of the largest single holders of a company s shares that style has attracted the attention of some shortsellers on wall street who have begun to smell blood in the water at least two shortsellers , who bet against stocks and therefore profit when share prices decline , say they have recently been scanning the list of pilgrim baxter s biggest positions to try to judge where pilgrim baxter might face further problems the shareholder redemptions have come as the technology sector has been roiled recently by earnings disappointments that have led to huge selloffs in certain stocks on monday , for example , shares of idexx labs inc fell 62 percent , to 12 , after the company said firstquarter earnings would plunge the same day , shares of medic computer systems inc fell 53 percent , to 13125 , after the company forecast lowerthanexpected sales in each case , pilgrim baxter was the company s secondlargest shareholder as of dec 31 , the most recent data available , holding 69 percent of idexx and 98 percent of medic in each case , putnam investments , a unit of the marsh mclennan companies , owned an overall larger position in the stocks but because putnam s holdings were spread over more funds and greater assets , the declines in most putnam funds have been less than in the pbhg funds mr pilgrim said that the pbhg funds limited their holdings of any one company to about 10 percent of its total shares in addition , no fund can own more than 3 percent of a company s shares in its portfolio we do n't have a strategy to concentrate our investments in a small number of companies , he said however , when the pbhg funds receive large inflows , as they did last year , the stocks i buy are the ones i already own , mr pilgrim said we buy them at the prevailing market prices does that mean i create inordinate upward pressure on the prices of those stocks \? i do n't think so mr pilgrim bristles at the suggestion that he does not pay attention to a company s valuation when buying shares but , he said , valuations are important only in relation to a company s growth prospects we do n't sit around and say , 'these stocks are overpriced , so we 're not going to buy anymore , ' he said if we felt they were overpriced , we 'd sell them it is only in retrospect , when a company discloses that its growth is going to slow dramatically , that we can look back and say , 'ok , that stock was overpriced , ' he said faced with lagging performance in the pbhg funds , many shareholders have turned tail and run since the beginning of february redemptions at the pbhg core growth fund , with 307 million in assets , have totaled 17 percent of assets the fund s value is down 177 percent this year the pbhg technology fund , with 498 million in assets , has lost 16 percent of its assets to redemptions its value is down 128 percent this year pbhg s two largest funds have had smaller redemptions pbhg growth , with 48 billion in assets , is down 162 percent in value this year but has had redemptions of only 35 percent of assets , or 174 million pbhg emerging growth , with 12 billion in assets , has had redemptions of 4 percent of assets its value has declined 18 percent since jan 1
if the various sports halls of fame banned drunks , drug addicts , wife beaters , check bouncers , philanderers , racists , bullies , foulmouths , sneak punchers and general misanthropes , you would have yawning gaps in cooperstown , canton , springfield and toronto at every sports banquet you have been forced to attend , there has undoubtedly been a gaseous speech about the characterbuilding aspect of sports but in fact , is there any place for even a minimal character requirement in sports \? the question comes up because a couple of baseball players have recently been charged with unpleasant behavior wil cordero of the boston red sox was charged with battering his wife last month , and it turned out cordero had also been charged with assaulting a previous wife the red sox tried to trade him , but when no other team would meet their demands , they put him back in the lineup he is apparently seeing a counselor about his behavior now the yankees must deal with mark whiten , who was arrested monday on suspicion of sexual assault on a woman in milwaukee the charges are being investigated , and no conclusions should be reached , but whiten has admitted having consensual sex with the woman in his hotel room two days after his wife gave birth to their second child charming i do n't want to sound disillusioned i'm not from the sentimental school that expects athletes to be role models for children of all ages all the evidence i have seen is that athletes have a skewed view of the world , that they learned as teenagers they can get away with things other people cannot just once i 'd like to see a team owner dismiss a player who still had a few base hits or fastballs left in him when dwight gooden got into a scuffle with a cabdriver this spring the recovering addict had gone to a strip joint with none other than whiten george steinbrenner was clearly furious with gooden but doc is hanging on as a regular starter , and he s off the hook with the owner for a while even if whiten is not charged with assault , i would like to see steinbrenner eat the guy s contract , even if it hurts the yankees there are 100 , 000 players in the minor leagues who can replace him the players association might protest , but steinbrenner could say hey , whiten is hitting 245 and sinking fast we needed to make a change whiten is due back this afternoon , and manager joe torre said he would have no problem playing him the standards are higher for sports officials , however and thank goodness for that thomas k welch , president of the salt lake olympic organizing committee , has been charged with assaulting his wife , alma , apparently after she confronted him about an extramarital affair the police and the courts will decide whether welch is guilty of assaulting his wife but welch had promoted the mormondominated salt lake city region as the ideal site for the 2002 winter games because of its high moral environment francois mitterrand had a mistress while he was president of france , but utah as somebody once observed is not france vive la difference both ways if there is any truth to the charges of the affair , welch will be seen to have fallen below the minimal standards of his community the one area where people have to watch their sex lives , or drinking , is in the area of diplomacy , ted wilson , a former mayor of salt lake city and director of the hinckley institute of politics at the university of utah , told the associated press people require their diplomats to be above reproach , wilson added it s unfortunate , but even the accusation creates a cloud that i think may cause tom to evaluate where he is welch is apparently on safari in africa when he gets back , he should prepare to buy his own tickets to the 2002 games if he does not resign immediately , his friends will spell it out for him another sports official due for a career change is john spano , the young hustler from dallas who flimflammed the national hockey league into giving him a shot at buying the islanders spano talked a good game about building a new hockey arena and upscale arcades in suburbia , but instead he may be making license plates with his own two mendacious little hands sports should never expect athletes to be role models , but the standards should be higher for top executives and it s always a good idea to find out if prospective owners have any money behind their big talk photo mark whiten \( associated press \)
there are many reasons to go to the independent the upstairs room , for instance , which is charmingly lowkey , with an intimate bar , bare brick walls and open beams or the lounge downstairs , whose pale mustard walls and weathered look make the twomonthold restaurant appear to have been there forever the young , attractive crowd , full of people who look as if you ought to recognize them , is another draw do you see madonna anywhere \? the man at the next table asked his date one night , craning his neck i heard she comes here then there are the charming waiters , who are friendly but do n't overdo it they banter a bit , but never enough to make you fear they will pull up a chair and join the party the moderate prices are appealing , too i ca n't think of another restaurant with a buzz where the entrees start at 1450 and what other hip , popular place has a sound level low enough for normal conversation \? but appealing as it is , i find it hard to imagine that many people are drawn to the independent for the food it is fine , but entirely forgettable which may be the point the restaurant is owned by stephen lyle , who was the chef at quatorze , then man ray before moving on to odeon in 1988 his partner , bruce hanks , was the maitre d'hotel at odeon the two seem to sense what their clientele wants , and they have created a restaurant with an intimate atmosphere and pareddown menu mr lyle , who was born in paris , may be identified with bistro cooking , but in his own restaurant he has tried to create something truly american so the menu offers a wide range of flavors , from the combination crab , cod and scallop cakes to barbecued pork ribs there is caviar for high rollers , roast beef for big eaters , a plate for those of the vegetarian persuasion considering that the chef is an owner , the food can be maddeningly inconsistent butternut squash soup is on both the lunch and dinner menus i have tried it three times and it has been different each one on my first visit the soup was thick and highly seasoned with cumin the next time it had the pure clear flavor of squash and it was wonderful but on my final visit the flavor of squash had disappeared , leaving the soup to taste of little more than the dollop of pesto in the middle of the bowl i had a similar experience with fried calamari on a bed of arugula they were great on one visit , greasy the next ditto the warm chicory salad with bacon , shallots and blue cheese one night it was a classically fine mix another night it was greasy with very little cheese and too much bacon \( some of which was pure fat \) the least complicated dishes tend to be best the roast chicken was always satisfying , the crispskinned bird served with mashed potatoes , spinach and a piece of lemon the steak is n't a great piece of meat , but you get your money s worth , a hunk of beef \( with pepper or bearnaise sauce for an extra dollar \) and a handful of good french fries the hamburger , served at lunch , is good , flavorful meat , served with a cold center when you ask for it rare and the mixed green salad , which has lemon in place of vinegar , is big and fine but mr lyle likes to play with classic formulas , and his experiments are not always successful it is hard to think of crab , cod and scallop cakes as anything but lowrent crab cakes adding avocado , sprouts and wasabi to a blt does not improve what is , in its pure form , a perfect sandwich and the fried oyster sandwich is not an improvement on the classic new orleans peacemaker it could use more oysters and more sauce then there is mr lyle s grilled lamb sausage , which is served in two tortillas with a wedge of lime it looks like something from a taco stand , but the chickpea , yogurt and mint sauce tastes entirely middle eastern it might actually work as a dish , but when i tried it the tortillas were dry and stale , making it unappealing occasionally , however , these twists on classics work well linguini tossed with arugula , basil and goat cheese is a sort of reinvented pesto , and it s good the housesmoked pork ribs are n't going to put stick to your ribs \( the best barbecue in new york city \) out of business , but they 're better than you have any right to expect in a restaurant with tablecloths and the cheesecake , zapped with ginger and bourbon sauce , is great so is the banana split it looks traditional bananas , chocolate sauce , nuts and whipped cream dip your spoon deep , however , and you find some berry sorbet snuggled between the two scoops of vanilla ice cream it is sneakily delicious the independent  179 west broadway , near leonard street , tribeca , \( 212 \) 2192010 ambiance a perfect new york bistro intimate , casual , beautifully lighted and filled with people who look as if they might be famous service friendly , but not too friendly sound level what a surprise !

it happened so quietly that few besides the shareholders and awestruck analysts seem to have noticed yet but a small marylandbased internet technology company recently went public and achieved a 344 billion market valuation overnight making it the largest stock offering by a startup company in history on its first day of trading , feb 7 , the ciena corporation s stock opened at 23 and closed at 37 , to reach that 344 billion market capitalization since then , the stock has traded as high as 4250 , settling on friday at 3925 in nasdaq trading , putting its market capitalization at 365 billion certainly , as initial public offerings and internet plays go , ciena s blistering start has generated none of the hoopla created 18 months ago when the netscape communications corporation achieved a 22 billion stock market valuation on the first day its shares traded i was puzzled when they came out with a huge valuation and nobody took notice , said jack wilson , managing editor of the technologic computerletter perhaps the internet frenzy has shifted and now we 're waiting for the companies to justify the enthusiasm as with many other companies going public , ciena so far has generated little revenue unlike other internet stocks that have achieved high valuations on no earnings , however , the company is profitable , having earned 147 million on revenue of 548 million in its 1996 fiscal year , which ended oct 31 it has forecast sales of 200 million in fiscal 1997 but ciena has only three customers so far a precarious position for any company , especially a small one in a business where huge potential rivals , including lucent technologies inc , are taking an interest investors' interest in ciena , which is based in savage , md , is part of the enthusiasm for a new technology that permits telecommunications companies to squeeze vastly more data through their networks fiber optic networks carry digital data as rapid pulses of light , permitting telephone companies to send voice and data at rates of billions of bits a second but even at these carrying capacities , major telecommunications routes are becoming overloaded by the explosion of telecommunications applications that range from the internet to new types of cellular phones ciena is the first company to market with a technology called wave division multiplexing , or wdm the technique is roughly equivalent to using a bundle of flashlights each with different colored light in place of a single flashlight to transmit data through fiber optic networks each color can carry a stream of information that does not interfere with the streams of other colors this is definitely the best way to transmit more information over a fiber optic network , said alan huang , a fiber optics researcher at the terabit corporation , a technology development company in menlo park , calif ciena s version of wdm can increase fiber optic network capacity up to 16 times that , telecommunications experts say , will allow companies to postpone the deployment of more costly network technologies company officials are not willing to speak publicly because ciena is still in the 30day quiet period the securities and exchange commission requires after an offering ciena was founded by two physicists , one of whom , david huber , had originally worked in fiber optic research at the gte corporation developing technologies that were intended for the cable television industry when the cable market proved a disappointment , they turned to three venture capital groups led by sevin rosen funds founded in 1992 , ciena raised 40 million to develop its technology for the longdistance communications business ciena announced its first sales in the third quarter of 1996 , to the sprint corporation this year it expects to make sales under a supplier s agreement with worldcom inc the competition to achieve higher and more costeffective fiberoptic capacity is intense companies already offering various forms of transmission enhancements include lucent , formerly part of the att corporation the alcatel alsthom group northern telecom inc the nec corporation pirelli spa , and siemens ag lucent and others have already said they plan to enter the market with wdm equipment ciena also notes in its prospectus that the field of fiber optics communications is a potential minefield of claims and counterclaims relating to intellectual property for at least an hour this was a mustown stock , said roger mcnamee , a managing partner at integral partners , a menlo park , calif , investment firm what happens from here is dependent on how much ciena is able to diversify its customer base
washington , june 5 investigators think two bombings last winter in atlanta were carried out by the same person or group and are weighing evidence that the same person might be responsible for the explosion at the olympics last july , a lawenforcement official said today the official said there were enough similarities between a jan 16 bombing at an abortion clinic and a feb 21 bombing at a gay nightclub for the authorities to conclude that they were probably linked in both incidents , there were two bombs , with the second apparently meant to cause additional bloodshed after a crowd had gathered devices in all three bombings contained nails the lawenforcement official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said it was a bit more speculative that the wintertime bombings were committed by the same person or persons who set off a bomb at centennial olympic park on july 27 but the official said investigators consider that a distinct possibility if the same party is responsible for the two bombings , or indeed for all three , the authorities are matching wits with a serial bomber the olympic park bombing killed a woman and injured scores of people in the abortion clinic bombing , no one was hurt in the first explosion , but a second blast in the clinic s parking lot an hour later injured seven people at the gay nightclub , a bomb went off on the patio , injuring five people the police found a second bomb hidden in the parking lot and detonated it using a robot the authorities have scheduled a news conference in atlanta on monday to discuss the progress of the investigations they have held several briefings like this , mostly centered on the centennial olympic park bombing , partly to review their progress and partly to seek help from the public in late february , investigators said they had found similarities but some differences between the winter bombings and were not ready to conclude that the two were linked today , the lawenforcement official confirmed that they were much closer to concluding just that the latest development in the investigation was reported today in the washington post , which said laboratory technicians had found striking similarities between the devices that exploded at the abortion clinic and the gay nightclub the designs were very similar , as were tool markings from bomb fragments , the post reported the lawenforcement official said he could not confirm those details but officials confirmed earlier that the devices used in the winter bombings , like the olympics bomb , contained nails and other shrapnel at monday s news conference , jack a daulton , the fbi inspector in charge of the bombing investigation , will field questions and , perhaps , ask for the public s help he will be accompanied by jack killorin of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms and milton e nix , director of the georgia bureau of investigation last march at a news conference in atlanta , the fbi released photographs and videotape frames showing the images of nine people whom the bureau wanted to question because they were in the olympic park around the time of the bombing within a day , seven people , none of them considered suspects , had been found and had provided what the fbi termed useful information
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , july 24 mira cokorilo loved her family s apartment it sits on the top floor of a 1912 building with large windows opening to liberation square near the pedestrian walkways and sidewalk cafes of sarajevo but , she says , it has been taken from her by a top adviser to president alija izetbegovic mrs cokorilo , 52 , an architect whose mother was a croat and father was a serb , first went to the apartment when she was 6 , but doubts she will ever go inside again in a move that has changed the fundamental character of a city once known for its cultural variety , the government has given to others the homes of thousands of jews , serbs and croats , and even muslims who left sarajevo during the war often the new residents are homeless refugees from other parts of bosnia but in many cases , bosnian officials and foreign diplomats say , the homes have gone to hoodlums , police officers , political leaders and high government officials the new owners , officials say , already have homes , and in taking the homes of people who left the city are keeping them from coming back the city the west came to save was shelled by the serbs , but its essence is being destroyed by its own leaders , a western diplomat said of the muslimdominated government here the bosnian laws that allow this come from emergency measures adopted during the war as hundreds of thousands of people fled ethnic violence the government ruled the homes of those who left sarajevo to have been abandoned , and gave itself the right to let someone else have them but those decisions have been ruled in violation of the dayton peace agreement signed in 1995 bosnian human rights officials estimate that up to 40 percent of the city s housing has changed hands , with the original residents , usually nonmuslims , being officially blocked from returning to their homes government officials say they do not know about any abuses , and hope to find places for those returning maybe , someday , their original homes but foreign officials are skeptical when we tell the government that their policy is illegal and it destroys a multicultural city , they say you are absolutely right , a european human rights official said then they do nothing to change it some of the well connected have acquired several additional homes others have gone from their old places to ones of comparative luxury we think more than 30 percent of those with new homes are 'untouchables , ' said esad muhibic , a muslim in the government responsible for monitoring human rights nothing happens to them we do not have the rule of law here the new residents in mira cokorilo s former apartment are kemal and jasna muftic mr muftic is a cultured man who is head of the government press agency , as well as a presidential adviser he is expected to be bosnia s next ambassador to china jasna muftic said the couple has no responsibility to return the apartment to mrs cokorilo this apartment was given to us by the government , she said mrs muftic said mrs cokorilo lost any claim to her home when she left the city nearby , standing above the main government buildings the apartment that used to belong to marjiana papo is now occupied by the most popular anchorman on bosnian government television , senad hadzifejzovic he said he feels no guilt , because as an important person in bosnia he deserves the apartment he asserted that his original home was destroyed during the war , but it seems to be intact , and still has his name on the door mrs papo , 72 , is one of some 500 jews who left sarajevo during the shelling after receiving commitments their homes would be secure none have gotten their home back mrs papo s family says that at her age , and after two wars and confinement in a nazi concentration camp , she has little spirit left to fight for her home anymore i used to think this was a religious or ethnic group question , but i was wrong , said mr muhibic , the human rights official it is not about muslims versus serbs or anybody these are masks to hide theft the worst people on all sides have the same thought as they lie awake at midnight , he said tomorrow , how will i make a profit from the chaos in this country \? the minister for displaced persons , rasim kadic , a muslim , said it was all right for him to move into an apartment from which a serb had been displaced this matter is resolved , mr kadic said the other man agreed that it would be all right because i promised to pay him for some of his furniture as a legacy from communism , most of sarajevo s housing is technically owned by the state , or a state institution occupants usually have the right of lifetime residency , and may pass that right to their heirs but the system makes it easier for the government to take someone s home and give it so someone else mrs cokorilo said she wants to come back to sarajevo to open an industrial design company it is the kind of help the city needs , and i can do it , she said but with the loss of her home , she doubts she will mr muhibic lamented that many others also may not return , but understands why they might no longer want to deep in the soul of sarajevo we want to return to the tolerant and multiethnic city we had before , he said but sarajevo is losing its experts and intellectuals now it is beyond whether they may get their homes back it s becoming a question of whether they should bother to return at all photo thousands of sarajevans who fled during the shelling have returned to find their homes given away , in violation of the dayton agreement yesterday , mira cokorilo looked up at the apartment she lost \( reuters for the new york times \)

martha s vineyard , mass a generous degree of confidence is required to invite friends to angle in your home waters , particularly if you are rightly or wrongly regarded as something of an expert there is always the possibility during the few days you have decided to play host that the fish you are seeking will not be around or that the weather will be unfavorable every professional fishing guide or charter boat skipper faces this all season long , but they though displeased by failure eventually acquire a healthy degree of emotional detachment it s a day s work in which you do the best you can when guiding friends on an informal basis , you also get to fish with a paying client this is usually taboo , and when the client fails to hook up there is always the thought that things would be different were the rod in your hands with friends , there is a fair chance a drawback , if you worry about tarnishing your image that they will do better than you newcomers to your area , unfettered by decades of local angling expertise , try outlandish flies or lures in dubious locations and sometimes catch fish while you are sitting on a rock smoking your pipe , waiting for them to heed your advice and move on last winter , i told a friend , willard weeks of amherst , mass , that the shore fly fishing for striped bass on martha s vineyard island is superlative in june , and before the phone conversation ended we had made plans for him and his wife , barbara , to visit ruth and me in june shortly before his arrival , will called to say that he had injured his knee and was unable to do much walking this was a setback i had planned to spend most of our time fishing a section of lobsterville beach known as dogfish bar because of the unusually wet spring , the dirt road to that location had been flooded for more than a month and was impassible the spot could be reached by a halfhour hike along the beach in waders , but that was out of the question for my guest on the afternoon he arrived , will asked if i would give his wife a short lesson in fly casting i discovered that she could get out a short line , 30 feet or so that would suffice , i told her , because bass often come to within a rod s length from shore at night when most of the fly fishing for bass on the vineyard is done will s bad knee and barbara s short casts notwithstanding , we caught fish on each of the three nights we went out on the first night the bass were breaking a few feet from shore and barbara soon had her first fly rod stripers on another evening after taking half a dozen small bass , will wondered aloud about the chances of catching a keeper in massachusetts , the recreational limit is one bass a day , 28 or more inches long to take home with him i told him that that was n't likely because all the fish in front of us seemed to be small a few minutes later while releasing yet another bass about 22 inches long , will allowed his fly to dangle in the water from his rod tip there was a big swirl as a fish took it , and 10 minutes later he had his keeper , a striper well over the minimum length limit so much for a local expert s predictions on that night he also caught twice as many fish as his guide a day before the weekses showed up , i had gone fishing for stripers one evening with harold \( buster \) welch , of winnipeg , manitoba , who was visiting the vineyard with his family buster had written me earlier in the year asking about the best time and locations for fly fishing the island s bass he immediately began catching fish at lobsterville beach , including one keeper , a fillet which he presented to ruth and me buster really did n't need my input an energetic , enterprising and engaging fellow , he had , by inquiring locally and consulting maps , pinpointed all the likely spots and was taking fish wherever he went the fillet he gave me was much appreciated because none of the 60 or 70 bass i had caught up to that time had been large enough to keep equally appreciated was his gift of two swatches of polar bear hair for tying flies , a rare material that i had never possessed before the road to dogfish bar dried out a few days after the weekses left , and while out there one night still trying to get my first keeper , a young fly fisherman came up to me in the dark and introduced himself he was dave radcliffe of northampton , mass , whom i had taken fishing at lobsterville nearly a decade before dave and i caught a few small bass in the next two hours and at midnight i called it quits , offering the opinion that no big fish were going to show dave stuck it out and shortly before dawn caught four stripers well over the legal limit , keeping one to give to me it occurred to me i might be able to keep bass in the freezer by wandering the beaches at night telling friends i encountered that i was unable to catch big fish several days later , i was back at dogfish alone , resolved to end the nokeeper syndrome in the first two hours after sunset i caught 24 bass and 2 of them were only an inch or two short of the legal limit bigger bass had to be out there perhaps they wanted something different i thought of the fly i had tied , using , among other things , a couple of dozen long strands of polar bear hair how fitting , i thought , to catch my first keeper of the season by making use of buster welch s gift on my second cast with that fly , a heavy fish hit and a minute or so later was deep into the backing , more than 150 yards offshore it was going with the swiftrunning , falling tide and five minutes went by before i got it turned and headed my way i relaxed i had broken the jinx , and skill and perseverance were being rewarded the rest was routine and i was pleased that i 'd had the foresight before i left home to rig an outside light over my cleaning table it was then that the hook pulled free drawing \( glenn wolff \)
hamilton , ontario , march 2 stalked by a fearless munchkin who gave up the quiet life in sugar land , tex , to cast a short but foreboding shadow on the women s skating scene , michelle kwan again succumbed to the uncommon performance pressure that comes from being pushed to the breaking point by a mere 14yearold this weekend though kwan , only 16 herself , thought it premature to be asked to pass the baton , and her title , to tiny tara lipinski two weeks ago at the united states figure skating championships , she seemed almost resigned when the same scenario recurred this time at an elite international event late saturday night in the champions series final like the impatient vince gill fans huddled in their sleeping bags outside the box office of copps coliseum , kwan could not wait for this twoday competition to leave town it s not one of my best performances , said kwan , who finished second to lipinski after bobbling two landings during her long program , but i 'll take it for now i have to still a world champion , at least until lipinski and a host of skaters led by lu chen of china tackle her at the world championships later this month in lausanne , switzerland , kwan acknowledged that she has her work cut out for her in regaining the psychological edge she once had on her peers after winning nine consecutive events , kwan has fallen short in her last two , undone both times by lipinski kwan rated her confidence level at 7 on a 10point scale , a tad short of championship material it s not very high , she said , but it s getting better after the nationals , it was a 1 , almost a negative after the nationals , kwan s perturbed coach , frank carroll , sat her down and encouraged her to forget about defending titles , to stop looking over her shoulder at lipinski and to start skating for herself the strategy was to have her get a little mad at herself and realize that she potentially is capable of being in a class by herself , carroll said the strategy did not quite work wonders the first time out right now it s michelle s battle against michelle , and i guess i'm glad she s fighting it now instead of next year , said carroll , who envisions kwan wearing a 1998 olympic gold medal in nagano , japan lately , whether burdened by the responsibility of retaining titles or distracted by everybody else s interest in toppling her , kwan has not been her old self even the midsection of her own program has become an enemy i got to that middle section and started thinking about all the jumps i had coming up , and i kind of went , poof , said kwan , who started her long program with two flawless tripletriples only to botch the landings on her next two jumps but it s not the end of the world , she said i 've still got worlds as does lipinski she s able to go out there and defeat a us champion , a world champion , whatever , said her coach , richard callaghan it s just another day at the office for her though none of the women skated their best , elvis stojko did everything except jump out of his skin in seizing the men s title the muscular canadian made history by landing the first quadrupletriple combination in competition and , bolstered by the artistic merit marks of 58 and 59 he received from six of seven judges , made light of the argument that his program lacks artistic depth he is , after all , a certified martial artist with a karate black belt the twotime world champion was the only contestant to give the boards a brash punch as he took to the ice , and after jumpstarting his program with a triple flip , the first of seven triples , he delivered his rivals a knockout punch in the form of his quadrupletriple toe manifesto stojko later said there was more where that came from i'm pushing the envelope , he said photo tara lipinski , center , michelle kwan , left , and irina slutskaya finished 123 in the champions series final \( associated press \)
for steve smith , the dream came true in the spring of 1991 when he became that needle in a haystack , the one in a million who managed to reach the national basketball association mr smith was drafted by the miami heat on the first round and was the fifth player selected overall the draft culminated a brilliant career at michigan state university and a long hard climb from the inner city of detroit during his rookie season in the nba , mr smith s dream was shattered when his mother died of cancer his older sister , janice , had been fatally shot when he was 8 years old but this was different clara bell smith was his best friend , nurturer , confidante , sage his coach for six seasons after his mother s death , mr smith , a 6foot7inch guard for the atlanta hawks , looked for a substantial way to commemorate her memory he wears a tattoo of a bell on his right arm that he touches before shooting a foul shot he has given away 70 , 000 a year for tickets so that youth groups can attend hawks home games he donates 50 for each three point shot he makes to the atlantabased makea wish foundation , which grants wishes to terminally ill children but nothing seemed substantial enough to honor his mother s memory he wanted something more enduring i just kept running different things through my head , mr smith , 28 , recalled recently last november mr smith was contacted by kirk gibson , the former detroit tiger baseball player and msu alumnus about contributing to a 6 million campaign to build a student athlete center on campus a light went on in mr smith s head this was it at the time , he was negotiating a lucrative contract with the hawks , to whom he 'd been traded in 1994 the contract was for a whopping 504 million over seven years by the time kirk gibson came along , mr smith was ready to put his money where his heart was after several meetings between his attorneys and michigan state university officials , mr smith contributed 25 million toward the construction of the building the largest known contribution from an active professional athlete to his alma mater substantial gifts to colleges and universities are certainly nothing new what makes the smith gift highly unusual , however , is its source a college athlete alumnus of all the groups of alumni , professional athletes are among the least likely to be associated with making hefty gifts to their respective schools outside of the athletics department at a time when even minimum salaries of professional football , basketball and baseball players are well into six figures , university officials have begun to recognize the universe of professional athletes as a relatively unexplored frontier and as mr smith s gift creates a few ripples in this universe , many development officers wonder why they have not tapped into this resource before now the more pertinent question is why have n't more professional athletes given more generously to universities the question is more complex than it appears and addresses a troublesome aspect of the relationship between bigtime athletic programs and universities many universities use their scholarship sports programs to curry favor with alumni and with boosters the schools use football and basketball programs to enhance the image and imagery of the university by using sports as a vehicle for national advertising in the midst of all this stands the recruited athletes they have become a peculiar combination of entertainer , gladiator and student who put themselves through school by utilizing the labor intensive skills they have honed for years the mutual , but illdefined backscratching between the university and recruits has created a hybrid called the studentathlete it has also created an ambivalence toward the university by athletes who look at the profits direct and indirect that the university derives from sports programs sometimes athletes have the feeling that they have given to their university by playing ball , said charles webb , the vice president of development at michigan state university wayne baskerville , director of development and alumni relations for the university of michigan s athletic department , brought up another more contemporary consideration a big problem with athletes giving is that so many of them are leaving school after their first or second year , and they are not having an opportunity to develop any connection with the school , he said some student athletes , particularly in football and basketball , say that those athletes who do remain on campus for four years are sometimes stigmatized by being on a socalled free ride many speak of alienation from the general student body and say they tend to bond primarily with with one another these feelings are often more pronounced in african american athletes who attend predominantly white colleges in many cases , the athletes would not have chosen the school nor the school the athlete but for athletics one development director who asked not to be identified said , a lot of black athletes do n't feel a connection to the school in many cases they feel they 've done a lot more for the university than the university has done for them they say 'the institution has kept me isolated , kept me in practices during the season , workouts and training after the season , the athletic dining hall , then study hall' all of it is centered around the athletic complex as a result they do n't go to a lot of social events they feel more loyalty to the team than they do to the university
philadelphia , may 31 joey kocur s hands are scarred , with lines like a road map , all leading to a dead end which is where he was when the national hockey league s season began last october he was a forgotten man kocur s latest contract had run out , and no one wanted a player who was about to turn 33 , had not scored a goal in nearly a year and seemed on the downside of a career in which he preferred fight to flight every team had a chance to acquire him , but only one of kocur s previous employers , the detroit red wings , showed any interest and that decision , so insignificant back in december when kocur was finally signed , proved crucial tonight in game 1 of the stanley cup finals at the core states center those same hands that have been in countless fights were used tonight to softly caress a backhand shot into the net on a breakaway in the first period that goal gave the red wings a 21 lead against the philadelphia flyers , and the red wings never trailed en route to a 42 victory kocur is a fourthline forward , charged with making sure the opponents do not score while he is on the ice and the red wings' scorers get a breather between shifts and when the game turns physical , kocur is front and center i used my hands for what kept me in the league , he said , smiling sheepishly if i 'd have tried to be a goal scorer , i 'd probably be on a farm somewhere the red wings were opportunistic , twice converting after forcing turnovers and it was their supporting cast , the muckers and grinders , whose goals sparked the red wings with a little more than four minutes remaining in the first period , kocur jumped onto the ice and made a beeline for the flyers' zone flyer defenseman kjell samuelsson tried to make an outlet pass from along the boards , but the pass was soft , and kocur pounced on it in front of him was nothing but net , and flyer goalie ron hextall kocur sped toward the net , faked a shot with his forehand , cut to the left and flipped a backhand shot past hextall my reaction \? kocur said my reaction was that i was shocked that i put one in in practice i 've tried that move a lot , but the puck usually ends up along the boards in the corner the red wings had taken a 10 lead at 6 minutes 38 seconds when another of their deadend kids , kirk maltby , scored on a twoonnone break while shorthanded maltby stole the puck with a poke check at center ice , then barreled into the flyers' zone with kris draper hextall had no chance maltby passed the puck to draper , and when hextall slid across the net in anticipation of a shot from draper , draper sent the puck right back to maltby , who fired it into the open net two goals out of them , and they were a presence every time they were on the ice , red wings coach scotty bowman said it would be hard to find two more unlikely players than kocur and maltby to provide the red wings' offensive spark kocur always has gone in fists first this past year , he played in 34 games and had 2 goals , 1 assist and 70 penalty minutes in his first tour of duty with the red wings , from 1985 until 1991 , kocur played in 399 games , scored 56 goals , had 55 assists and had 1 , 714 penalty minutes kocur was on the rangers when they won the stanley cup in 1994 but his career seemed to go into free fall over the next two seasons the rangers traded him to the vancouver canucks for goalie kay whitmore , who never played a game for the rangers kocur played all of seven games for the canucks , and when last season was over , he became a free agent the red wings did not sign him until dec 28 , two and a half months into this season in the meantime , he stayed in shape by playing for a red wing alumni team he did not play his first game until jan 3 , and he did not score a goal until feb 6 , his first goal since 1995 kocur said the red wings , specifically bowman , have resurrected his career things were tough in new york colie , he said , referring to rangers coach colin campbell , liked to use three lines , like a lot of coaches but scotty uses the whole bench i 've played a lot more than i have in the past seven or eight years
new orleans , jan 27 the super bowl is over , but the dispute between bill parcells and the new england patriots goes on in the latest development , national football league commissioner paul tagliabue announced today that he would mediate the ongoing battle between the two parties and determine whether parcells is free to leave the patriots and , if he does , what compensation the patriots are entitled to tagliabue will listen to the warring parties tuesday on a telephone conference call and may make a decision as early as wednesday or thursday the jets , who want to put parcells in charge of their beleaguered franchise , are eagerly awaiting tagliabue s ruling steve gutman , the jets' president , said today that the jets would have nothing to say until the process is concluded under the league s tampering rules , gutman is not free to talk to parcells until the coach s contract dispute with the patriots is resolved the jets have not interviewed anyone for their vacant headcoaching post since rich kotite stepped down before the team s final game of the season on dec 22 but jets players , frontoffice officials and coaches , along with most of the football world that was here for the super bowl , believe parcells is the jets' obvious choice and that parcells is ready to make the move the patriots' owner , robert k kraft , who requested tagliabue s intervention , is not making it easy on parcells in what has escalated into a distinct battle of ego and will , as well as legal niceties , kraft believes he is entitled to compensation if parcells departs parcells believes none is necessary kraft sent a copy of the contract to tagliabue s office last friday , only 48 hours before the patriots lost to green bay packers in super bowl xxxi the original contract with parcells , signed when the patriots were under different ownership , was a fiveyear deal , worth about 12 million a year , that extended through the 1997 season but there was to be a penalty of 12 million if parcells did not fulfill the contract the deal was amended last march , though , when parcells was granted his wish to cut the contract short by one season , without paying any penalty according to kraft , parcells told him he had concerns about his health the coach has had heartbypass surgery as well as two angioplasty procedures what am i going to do \? kraft has said of the agreement to shorten the contract hold a gun to his head \? he was worried about his heart the patriots claim that in return for lopping a year off parcells s contract , and forgiving the penalty , they retained exclusive rights to him for the 1997 season if he wanted to continue as a head coach or in another comparable position in the nfl and that apparently means that kraft wants compensation if parcells seeks to coach another team next season kraft has never spelled out the compensation he might want , but he seems determined to keep parcells from going to a division rival which the jets are without something in return according to a statement released by tagliabue , parcells asserts that other parts of the contract entitle him to leave the patriots and coach for another nfl team in 1997 if he desires in stating their case to tagliabue , parcells and his agent , robert fraley , will make the point that parcells , to amend the contract , yielded a 300 , 000 fee he had been receiving for wearing patriotendorsed gear on the sideline this is the third postsuper bowl controversy on parcells s resume after the giants captured their first super bowl title , in january 1987 , fraley had negotiations with the atlanta falcons on parcells s behalf , but the giants made parcells honor his existing contract after the giants won the super bowl four years later , fraley was close to an agreement that would have sent parcells to tampa bay interestingly , it took four years as a head coach for parcells to make it to his first super bowl and four more years to win his second one and it took him four years to get the patriots to the big game at this rate , if he took over the jets next season , they would reach the super bowl in 2001 they have not been there since 1969 parcells is likely to find the jets to be more compliant than the patriots his immediate boss would be gutman , who is willing to invest football power in one man the jets' owner , leon hess , is not a daily presence parcells would be given the final word in the draft and on all trades he did not have that power with the giants , but once had it with the patriots however , kraft , after buying the team in 1994 , began to question parcells s judgment and authority why should we pay 2 million a year for scouting and not use their pick \? he asked in reflecting on the last draft our staff had terry glenn far and away the best player on the board , but bill did n't want him glenn , the wide receiver , became one of the league s stars kraft also said that the patriots had an organization in place that was good enough to capture the american football conference championship , and that he wanted to keep the structure he also said , in hardly an oblique reference to parcells , that just because you 're good on the football field does n't mean you 're a good administrator in any event , the patriots left for new england this morning without parcells , who was headed to new jersey with his family on another flight his linebackers coach , dante scarnecchia , said he was told that parcells would meet tuesday morning with kraft and then with the coaches in the afternoon extra points various sources reported that pete carroll , the former jets coach , told friends he would become the patriots' next coach even though the patriots denied that they met with him carroll is the san francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator photos bill parcells , walking off the field after the super bowl , says he is a free agent the patriots say they own rights to him through next season \( doug pensinger allsport \) \( pg b13 \)
chicago , march 5 the federal government settled a lawsuit today against representative henry j hyde , the head of the house judiciary committee , and 11 other former directors of a bankrupt illinois savings bank none of the defendants' payment of 850 , 000 is to come from mr hyde i was always prepared to go to trial no matter what the cost , mr hyde , the illinois republican , said in a statement after a federal judge approved the settlement this morning i was determined not to surrender to a claim that was without foundation and , in my opinion , an abuse of government power the government had accused the directors of the bank , clyde federal savings and loan association , of lax oversight leading to a series of questionable deals and investments that contributed to the bank s collapse in 1990 the resolution trust corporation , the government agency created to clean up the mess left by widespread failures of savings and loan associations , bailed out clyde federal at a cost to taxpayers of 67 million in its lawsuit , the government had sought 172 million in damages from the directors lawyers involved in the settlement , in which none of the defendants admitted any wrongdoing , described it as a commonsense alternative to a long court battle but critics said it offered special treatment for mr hyde , who insisted on a separate agreement that made it clear he would not contribute to the settlement some , like timothy anderson , a former bank consultant who has been pressing for further investigations into illinois savings and loans , have wondered why congress has not looked into mr hyde s involvement in the case given that the government spent over 30 million to investigate the clintons' involvement in madison guaranty , mr anderson asked , referring to the arkansas savings bank linked to the whitewater affair , why has n't congress shown any interest in whether the chairman of the house judiciary committee was directly involved in activities at this bank that cost the taxpayers even more when it collapsed \? investigators said they found no evidence of fraud in the clyde federal case nor was there evidence that mr hyde directly gained anything other than his director s fees of 300 a month during the two and onehalf years he served on the board , starting in 1981 mr hyde has said that as an outside director he relied on the advice of finance professionals in all of his votes there has been little interest in the case on capitol hill , where the courteous mr hyde is liked by members of both parties even as his power demands respect i 've brought this matter to over 25 democrats and have n't found a single one willing to go up against henry hyde , said gary ruskin , director of the congressional accountability office , an ethics lobbying group minutes from clyde s board meetings indicated that regulators informed the board during mr hyde s tenure that the bank was on a course toward bankruptcy in about a year mr hyde has repeatedly said that the bank was not in financial trouble at the time , based on then prevalent accounting rules lawyers involved in the settlement said today that some of the paying defendants might have been bankrupted by a trial , and that the government would not have recovered anything close to the 172 million it sought the settlement more than covered the 700 , 000 the government spent on the case and related litigation , said steven katsanos , a spokesman for the federal deposit insurance corporation , the agency that inherited the case from the rtc at the end of 1995 , when the trust closed mr anderson contended that the settlement squandered an opportunity to shed light on the connections between bank insolvencies in illinois and those in other states taxpayers eventually paid more than 130 billion to have insolvent savings banks merged with healthier competitors and to compensate federally insured depositors , including about 68 million in the clyde case in addition , the government must pay interest on money borrowed to cover that spending mr hyde s codefendants have declined to comment publicly on today s settlement the others have long since gotten over their irritation that henry insists on paying nothing , said sean sullivan , a chicago lawyer who represents several other former board members it s just too expensive to take the case to trial
in 1938 orson welles shocked the radio audience with his realistic adaptation of the war of the worlds sean burns , 9 , of chappaqua had a similar reaction recently when he turned to his favorite rock station , wrgxfm , 1071 , which is in hawthorne , and heard nothing but musical themes from old television shows he thought martians had taken over the station , his mother , leslie lew burns , said at the same time in long branch , nj , listeners to a goldenoldie station , wzvufm , 1071 , lost their favorite music while those tuned to wwhbfm , 1071 , in hampton bays wondered what happened to the traditional rock two days later the television themeshow music disappeared no aliens had landed , but the stations were suddenly playing ballads of lost loves , lonesome prairies and woeful ventures into gambling a company called odyssey communications , which operates three stations spanning the new york city region , established a trimulcast called new country y107 , all synchronized to 1071 fm we needed some time to physically gear up for the format change , said steve blatter , vice president of programming for odyssey , explaining the mysterious episode the y in the call letters was chosen because it was an easy way to remember the station position on the dial and would help create a different identity , mr blatter said mike kakoyiannis , the company s president and chief executive officer , said radio s largest market has gone too long without a country radio station the format opportunity has been obvious , the need has been obvious , the support has been obvious odyssey is dedicated to making the country format a success in new york the new programming , begun in december , ended a 10month absence of country music in new york radio but what made the company think that substantial numbers of the 14 million listeners in new york , new jersey and connecticut as well as in southern new jersey and on long island s east end wanted to hear country music \? first of all , mr blatter answered in a telephone interview from his office in hawthorne , country music today is not country music of 15 years ago he continued its greatest appeal is its 'relateability' the majority of the songs have lyrics that relate to adults they include lost loves but also about going out and having fun on saturday night but a sample listening recently revealed sounds similar to ones heard from rural jukeboxes decades ago mr blatter said the age of the target audience for y107 they are still working out the call letters was 25 to 54 , observing that of the more than 50 am and fm stations in the area , none except for a small station in western suffolk county , offered country music we conducted two large research studies in the new york market to check the format viability , mr blatter said the research made us confident that the format is very viable it just has been underachieving over the last four or five years his program is relying on the music of garth brooks , clint black , shania twain and reba mcentire as well as distinctive promotion and presentation to make country music a radio staple odyssey headquarters as well as its westchester station are in an office park in hawthorne , its antenna a few miles away in the shadow of the westchester county penitentiary , which is also used for the police radio band each station is only 3 , 000 watts , but odyssey said there is a multiplier effect giving the station a broader range by using the trimulcast the company based its optimism for success here in part on a trimulcast in los angeles where it envisioned a need for mainstream rock on its klyyfm radio station and said it went from 50 , 000 to 600 , 000 listeners in six months is the perception of enthusiasm for country music connected to the popularity of country or line dancing in the suburbs \? not really , said mr blatter , who lives in manhattan a very small percentage of listeners go out and dance to the stuff it s nothing i would do on a saturday night after almost two months of broadcasting , there are no figures on how many people are tuning in to y107 , and mr blatter was reluctant to make an estimate before the stations changed format the audiences combined were approximately a quarter of a million , he said we expect to do at least that and significantly better than that there is also the issue of how to position advertisers one recent commercial had a man selling cars for a dealership in lakeland , nj , hardly an effective appeal for listeners in east hampton , peekskill or stamford mr blatter said there used to be a bias against country music by advertisers , but since the music now reaches a contemporary audience more sophisticated advertisers are using the station he compared the seemingly uneconomic offering by advertisers of new jersey cars to drivers on the east end of long island to the practice of politicians who spend money reaching listeners who cannot vote for them in order to be able to address a target audience that might be mixed in with the other listeners jason steinberg , director of marketing and promotions for the station , said , country music fans are the most passionate and loyal audience in radio he said a few people complained during the period when there was a loss of the rock format and when there was television music before the introduction of the new country format , but since then , he added , more than 2 , 000 people have sent email messages endorsing the change not the burns family of chappaqua , however , which was happy with the old format i can understand changing a radio format for business purposes , mrs burns said but in that vein the heads of 1071 are just not thinking then again there is another point of view from one listener , the television show host and comedian david letterman , who broadcasts his show from the west side of manhattan and lives in suburban connecticut talking on the air with the country singer dwight yoakam last month , mr letterman said he was too lazy to change his presets on his radio and had become addicted to that country music on y107 photo darrin smith , a disk jockey at y107 radio in hawthorne \( chris maynard for the new york times \)
david cudaback , the editor of institutional investor , returned from a week s vacation on nantucket on aug 25 to discover that he had been dismissed it was not the greatest 52d birthday present for mr cudaback , though , it was hardly a surprise euromoney publications plc , the harddriving british publisher , had just bought his magazine and had indicated that it would replace much of institutional investor s top management as well as ousting mr cudaback , a 21year veteran of the publication , euromoney institutional investor s oldest rival has in recent days put its own managers in charge of the main units of ii , as it is known on the street the president , publisher , operations director and art director are all leaving , and more executives and journalists on the restive staff are expected to follow euromoney s 142 million acquisition of institutional investor , completed on aug 29 , is a british takeover of a wall street institution with its glossy monthly magazine that peeks out of investment bankers' briefcases , its annual rankings of securities analysts that can make or break a career , a stable of profitable financial newsletters and conferences , and its smart offices on madison avenue , institutional investor has become a vital part of the new york securities markets and the broader american financial community it was founded in 1967 by gilbert e kaplan , and in its heyday , in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s , it defined much of the coverage of international money with its carefully researched feature articles on leading financiers euromoney s challenge , say people familiar with both companies , will be to find a way to merge decidedly different cultures on opposite sides of the atlantic , to inject its acknowledged commercial energy and marketing skill , but to be careful not to jar institutional investor s editorial independence and established reputation for reporting and writing that could be a problem critics at institutional investor and elsewhere on wall street contend that euromoney has allowed its editorial content to be influenced too much by a desire to increase advertising revenues charges that euromoney and its executives repeatedly denied and in contrast to ii s select lists of wall street s best , euromoney s articles feature endless winners of competitions , with the june issue alone heralding the best spanish borrower , the best australian borrower and the best user of exotic currencies conflicts of interest are a frequent concern in financial journalism , where advertisers which are both news subjects and news sources are often drawn from a concentrated group of bankers and traders even the best publications sometimes fail to avoid them the sale of institutional investor , arranged by credit suisse first boston on behalf of the walt disney company , attracted interest from other publishing powerhouses , like pearson plc , the thomson financial publishing group and the economist institutional investor had become part of the disney empire in 1996 after disney s takeover of capital cities abc mr kaplan , the founder , sold the company to capital cities inc in 1984 for a sum reported to be 72 million , and stayed for a while before retiring to pursue his interest in conducting music euromoney was the most eager bidder despite its prowess in london , it has never made much of a mark in the united states , home of the biggest financial markets what makes euromoney s acquisition of this wall street icon particularly incongruous is that it occurs just as new york s giant securities firms appear to be consolidating their dominant position in london and other international financial markets and euromoney is no british giant , but a grouping of many small but often very profitable publishing ventures euromoney magazine has a circulation of about 32 , 000 , which is dwarfed by institutional investor s 147 , 000 copies the acquisition is by far euromoney s biggest ever and it has forced the london company , 73 percent owned by the daily mail , the fleet street tabloid , to take on significant debt for the first time in its 28year history , borrowing 150 million from a group of banks it is the cultural issues , though , that probably pose the biggest challenges euromoney s executives spent several days this week huddled in negotiations with robert teitelman , managing editor of institutional investor s americas edition , who they just named editor to replace mr cudaback to protect ii s reputation , mr teitelman , 43 , said he had negotiated a clause in this contract to insure editorial independence he worked out a mechanism , which he would not describe in detail , to guarantee that independence if it is violated , he said , it would affect my tenure here the magazine , which accounts for more than a third of the company s revenues , was the first business publication ever to win the national magazine award and was a finalist three other times it has also won awards from , among others , the deadline club , the loeb foundation and the overseas press club

dr robert g newman , who as president of beth israel medical center for the last 18 years guided its expansion into one of the largest health care networks in the city , is stepping down from that post to concentrate his efforts full time on the joint corporation that beth israel formed in december with the st luke sroosevelt hospital center since the partnership between the two hospitals was created , dr newman has continued his duties as president and chief executive officer of beth israel while carrying the same load for the greater metropolitan health system , the parent corporation governing the two institutions his decision to commit his time fully to the new 14 billion corporation , dr newman said , was a sign that both sides have a firm commitment to the stability and strength of the partnership and that this is a partnership that is here to stay beth israel has named dr matthew e fink , chairman of its department of neurology , to replace dr newman dr fink will report to dr newman , as does dr ronald c ablow , the president and chief executive of st luke sroosevelt hospitals in the city and across the country have been in a frenzy of merging , consolidating and affiliating , all in an effort to become more efficient and more attractive to the health maintenance organizations that increasingly control care new york hospitals had , in general , been slow to join this trend , and many deals that were announced in the last year to great fanfare have fallen apart as institutions that were longtime competitors failed to find a way to blend their resources the most prominent of those deals an effort to join the hospitals and medical schools of new york university and mount sinai fell apart two months ago , when the two sides failed to agree on a way to merge the medical schools executives at st luke sroosevelt and beth israel said they had decided specifically to form a partnership that was not a merger so they could avoid some of those pitfalls each hospital maintains its own board of trustees and clinical departments and is responsible for its own assets and debts each hospital has also continued its independent academic affiliation st luke sroosevelt is a teaching site for columbia university s college of physicians and surgeons , and beth israel is the manhattan teaching hospital for the albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university but working together , the two hospitals can bargain jointly with managedcare companies and insurers to get more favorable rates and can increase their purchasing power by getting larger discounts for bigger orders officials at both hospitals are also meeting to find ways to collaborate on research and other projects by moving full time to this job , i can better work to help the two institutions find the best areas for collaboration and partnership , said dr newman in this partnership , we have all the opportunities and none of the pressures of merging , and our joint projects are moving forward quickly

washington , aug 2 with the ob made measuredly easier by the bipartisan deal to balance the budget , congress left town this week for a monthlong recess with both houses having passed a majority of the 13 spending bills that are needed to run the federal government and the district of columbia none of the appropriations bills have reached president clinton s desk , or even gone through the negotiating process between the house and the senate and the 8 spending bills that have passed in the house and the 10 that the senate have completed put congress on roughly the same pace it was on the previous two years of republican control but in a change from the 104th congress , the spending bills have advanced this year without fanfare and with nothing approaching the partisan bitterness that led to the partial shutdowns of the federal government to the annoyance of many conservatives , especially some of the junior members in the house , republican leaders have been decidedly less eager to clash with the white house over the spending bills this year in large part that is a result of the balancedbudget deal that president clinton , speaker newt gingrich and senator trent lott , the majority leader , agreed to earlier this year and that the house and senate passed this week , along with a bill to cut taxes the budget bill forced both sides into certain compromises but more important , it raised the level of spending , which removed from the table the one issue between the republicans and the democrats that had caused previous clashes , including the events that led to the partial shutdown of the government two years ago republican leaders , especially in the house , are also still smarting from the public relations pummeling they took over the two partial shutdowns of the federal government , and more recently from their handling of the disaster relief bill for victims of flooding in the dakotas and other areas that has prompted them to avoid adding contentious riders to the spending bills we 've had two and a half years of learning experience , said representative robert l livingston , the chairman of the house appropriations committee clearly we do n't have the votes to override a presidential veto so when the president digs his heels in and says he s going to veto something because a particular provision is in there , we either take that seriously or gear up for a collision that does n't mean we avoid collisions sometimes you 've got to have them some things that we feel strongly enough about we 'll be happy to put the president on the spot and call his bluff and see what happens over the last month , the house has passed 8 of the 13 appropriations bills agriculture interior military construction transportation veterans' affairs , housing and urban development and independent agencies energy and water development defense , and legislative it still must vote on bills for the district of columbia foreign operations commerce , justice , state and judiciary treasury , postal service and general government , and labor , health and human services and education the more moderate senate has seldom become embroiled in the level of rancor over spending bills that the house has exhibited , and senators left town with all but three of the spending bills for 1998 approved interior district of columbia and the enormous labor and health and human services bill all 13 spending bills are supposed to be passed by congress and signed into law by the president by oct 1 , the start of the federal government s budget year the major partisan flareups in the house in this year s appropriations cycle have come not from the appropriations committee , but from the rules committee , which sets the conditions for floor debate in an effort to appease some conservative members , the republican leadership has allowed a number of contentious issues to be amended to the spending bills through the rules committee twelve of the 13 appropriations bills that have come out of committee have been absolutely bipartisan , said representative david r obey , the senior democrat on the appropriations committee then the republican leaders have gone to the rules committee on a number of bills and turned bipartisan products into partisan battlefields because of conditions that they imposed on debate mr obey and other democrats on the appropriations committee did not support the house s own spending bill because they said it included a slush fund for the speaker that bill passed in the house on thursday with the money for the speaker intact so far , the only spending bill that has clearly put the republicans on a collision course with the clinton administration is the interior bill the house , in its version , killed the national endowment for the arts by stripping its entire 995 million in spending that action brought a veto threat from mr clinton and a rebuke from the senate , which included 100 million for the arts endowment in its version of the interior bill house and senate negotiators must reconcile their differences in all the spending bills before congress sends the 13 separate pieces of legislation to the white house for the president s signature and supporters of the arts endowment have said they are confident the agency will survive but mr livingston and other leaders got a clear indication this week that the appropriations road this year is far from being completely free of political potholes and bumps a group of republican conservatives in the house successfully blocked floor consideration of the labor , health and human services and education bill on wednesday by threatening to offer hundreds of amendments part of the budget deal required that overall spending in that bill increase by 4 percent , and that has angered many republicans who are demanding cuts in spending , not increases and the conservatives also objected to their leadership s decision to strip an antiabortion provision from the legislation the republican leadership was forced to put off consideration of the labor and health spending bill until after the august recess more than anything , the flareup demonstrated the precarious political situation that the republican congressional leaders , especially mr gingrich , find themselves in with the appropriations bills mr gingrich got a significant political lift with the passage of the balanced budget and the taxcutting bills but the weakened mr gingrich is still compelled to pay attention to the demands of the conservatives that was forcefully demonstrated by the recent abortive effort to oust him as speaker while honoring commitments in the balancedbudget deal that go against many of the beliefs and desires of his rank and file mr livingston said that the republican leadership had anticipated that a significant number of members would oppose the labor and spending bill , noting that 26 republicans voted against the budget deal because it increased spending we either pass that labor , hhs bill in bipartisan fashion or we do n't pass it at all , he said so we have taken an interest in trying to reduce the controversial riders on that bill in order to maintain bipartisan support photos because of detailed negotiations , president clinton , with vice president al gore on friday , has avoided a partisan faceoff over the budget \( reuters \) senator trent lott of mississippi , the majority leader , and speaker newt gingrich are dealing with far less rancor over spending this year \( associated press \) \( pg 26 \)
leipzig , germany for a rough idea of what has happened in the former east germany , imagine someone wrote a check worth 1 trillion to a state with an economy the size of north carolina s since the berlin wall fell in late 1989 , half the homes in eastern germany have been renovated schools and museums , parks and playgrounds , factories and power plants have been showered with money the trabant , the cramped , smokebelching car that came to symbolize everything people hated about the old communist regime , is all but extinct , replaced by millions of shiny volkswagens , bmw s and mercedesbenzes eastern germany with an economic output last year of about 230 billion now has twice the number of shopping malls per resident as western germany it has 5 , 000 miles of new highways , 2 , 800 miles of new railroad track and one of the world s best telephone systems and nowhere has the adrenaline of all that money had more impact than in this historic city 80 miles southwest of berlin smartly dressed men and women eat and shop in the exquisitely renovated art deco downtown district goldpainted sculptures adorn the renovated baroque facade of commerzbank s branch the oncecrumbling skyline now blazes with office towers and luxury hotels and just out of town are a gleaming new international airport , a 1 billion convention center and a 15 billion cargohandling facility since 1990 , the german government in bonn has given more than 600 billion to its former eastern rival through business subsidies , special tax breaks and support payments for individuals enticed by the tax breaks and subsidies , companies have invested 500 billion more but for all the cash thrown at eastern germany , the economy remains fundamentally bankrupt even as wages have skyrocketed in a rush to catch up with those in the west , there are not nearly enough real jobs to go around unemployment is at 25 percent , growth has almost ground to a halt , output per worker is still half the rate of western germany s , and exports are minuscule never before in history has one country spent so much money building pyramids , said norbert walter , chief economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt there has been a tremendous waste of economic resources in leipzig , a third of the work force is unemployed after accounting for governmentfinanced makework jobs and early retirement programs a third of the office space is vacant , including several of the fanciest new buildings local tax revenue accounts for just onetenth of the city s 2 billion annual budget the only thing that keeps eastern germany afloat is billions upon billions of marks handed out by chancellor helmut kohl s government every year all this is causing big problems not just for germany but for europe , too loaded with 300 billion in debt related to eastern germany , the country is in danger of not being able to meet the fiscal requirements to qualify for the euro , the single european currency planned for 1999 and without germany , there can be no euro soon , wrecking the timetable on which europe s political leaders have pinned much of their hopes for longterm economic recovery the domestic repercussions are just as bad even as the 60 million western germans become angrier about paying a 75 percent solidarity surtax for reconstructing the eastern section , which has fewer than 20 million people , mr kohl is trying to cut health and retirement benefits to reduce the deficit for all the excess , some experts argue that in the end germans will witness a huge payoff from the eastern spending spree if they wait for a decade or more but others contend that eastern germany combines the worst of two worlds the bankrupt legacy from 45 years of communist mismanagement and the goldplated rigidity that has jeopardized western germany s own ability to compete on the world market and to the government s chagrin , former eastern bloc countries like poland , hungary and the czech republic , which received a fraction of eastern germany s external aid , are growing faster and attracting a lot of unsubsidized investment from germany s biggest companies those countries , by contrast , have kept wages competitive and relied mostly on freemarket forces since the collapse of the soviet system we blew it in east germany , said herbert a henzler , chairman of the german office of mckinsey company , the consulting firm in terms of economic policy , we did almost everything wrong high cost of labor wages are up productivity is n't where did all the money go \? what many german economists say is not so much that the money was simply poured down a rat hole as that eastern germany s problems boil down to one almost unbelievable statistic the average hourly wage in eastern germany has soared to more than 16 an hour , actually slightly higher than in the united states in a wellintentioned but damaging series of decisions in the early 1990 s , the german government essentially imposed west germany s entire structure of high wages and mandatory social benefits onto an economy that had collapsed west germany s powerful labor unions added to the pressure , pushing hard to extend the terms for all western contracts into the eastern states in part to avoid hearing an immediate ross perotstyle sucking sound of jobs moving from west to east
tampa , fla , march 22 wade boggs , a sixtime american league batting champion , was explaining what happens when he tries to pull a pitch to right field , perhaps with the hope of reaching the fence if i go up there with the intent to pull , my mechanics totally break down , the yankee third baseman said i get hard on my front side , i collapse my back side , i get a big loop in my swing and i get a real long swing i get jammed about 9 times out of 10 when i try to do that tony gwynn has won the national league batting championship seven times sometimes he gets delusions of grandeur , thinking he might hit more than a handful of home runs i'm hoping one of these last few years i could hit some home runs , the san diego padres' prince of hitting said i 've been trying it for 15 years i just ca n't do it willie stargell always says your time will come i'm running out of time try or wish as they might , gwynn and boggs have not joined the group of players who hit for average and for power from the looks of last season , they may soon be in the minority in as dramatic a development as any in baseball in many seasons , last season s offensive onslaught produced a dozen players who hit 300 or higher and socked 40 or more home runs in six of the previous eight seasons , that 300 40 mark featured only one hitter or none at all the largest contingent in that period was four in 1993 , only a third of last year s total this , frank thomas said , is the new age of baseball the new age , in fact , is such the rage that mark mcgwire joined it last season besides hitting a major leaguehigh 52 home runs , mcgwire batted 312 , a whopping 60 points above his career average what s a career average \? mcgwire said that does n't necessarily mean you 're going to do that your entire career but the oakland slugger had earned his 252 career mark , batting as low as 201 in 1991 yet here he was last season , adding his name to the bulging list of new age hitters thomas of the chicago white sox , ken griffey jr of seattle , mo vaughn of boston , juan gonzalez of texas , albert belle of cleveland \( but now the white sox \) , barry bonds of san francisco , gary sheffield of florida , ken caminiti of san diego and three colorado busters , ellis burks , andres galarraga and vinny castilla brady anderson of baltimore \( 297 50 \) missed making it by two hits mark mcgwire just connected with more home runs , bonds said , laughing that made his average a lot higher thomas offered a more serious assessment of the latecareer development of the 33yearold mcgwire he stopped trying to hook everything , the massive first baseman said about his large colleague he 'll take the ball to right field a lot more i watched him last year that s what the young talent was doing , so he changed his game a little bit he s as strong as they come mcgwire combined intelligence with strength , jason giambi , his impressive young teammate , said all those times he s been hurt , giambi said , he sat down and learned his swing , watching films on pitchers , watching his reaction to how guys were pitching him he hardly ever swings at a bad pitch he knows exactly what he s going to swing at , what areas he s going to swing at , and if they do n't throw it there he s not going to swing at it in transforming himself into a 300 hitter while maintaining his massive numbers of home runs , mcgwire has embodied many of the elements that have contributed to the creation of thomas s new age watching tapes , hitting to all fields , growing stronger that s what the young talent has been doing these past few years they lead the offensive lineups that have taken control of the game they have been aided by a declining corps of pitchers , who have generally conceded the inside part of the plate to the hitters and have thus invited them to tee off at will at unchallenging pitches on the outer half of the plate once upon a time , weight lifting was not only foreign to baseball , but also taboo we were n't allowed to touch a weight , ken griffey sr , a coach with the cincinnati reds , said thomas now calls the reason behind that prohibition a myth , the idea that lifting weights would tighten a hitter s upper body and restrict his ability to swing the guys are really hitting the weight room , said the 6foot5inch , 260pound thomas , who has batted 300 or higher all six of his full major league seasons and has hit 38 or more home runs each of the last four that s very important it pays off the ball is going further off the bat i noticed that five years ago ever since , i 've been in the weight room full time in the off season , thomas added , he lifts his way through a twohour morning program five days a week it does n't kill you , he said it pays off down the road don baylor , a player in the preweightlifting era and now the manager of colorado s three 300 40 hitters , said the extra strength pays off not only with balls flying out of the park , but also with lesser hits players did not get before they overpower the ball , baylor said they 're strong enough to muscle the ball over the infield to get hits
daytona beach , fla , feb 13 the super bowl of nascar racing , the 34th annual daytona 500 , completed its 42car field today with two veterans named dale stamping themselves as notable contenders the defending daytona 500 champion , dale jarrett , 40 years old , won today s first division of the gatorade 125mile race at the daytona international speedway , earning starting spot no 3 for sunday s race with a 166113 mileanhour average and dale earnhardt , a seventime winston cup champion , earned the no 4 starting position by taking the second leg in his chevrolet with a 162749 mph average in earlier qualifying , mike skinner and steve grissom took the top two pole positions sunday jarrett just seemed glad he got to race today in a division that did n't include the 45yearold earnhardt last year , jarrett finished fourth in the 125mile qualifier that earnhardt won he s the only one that wins this race , it seems , jarrett said indeed , earnhardt has won eight consecutive 125mile qualifiers here and 10 over all yet earnhardt has never won in 18 daytona 500 s , a string of futility that everyone here knows well it s only fitting that he win at least once here , jarrett said but then again , i 'd like to win the next 10 before i retire if he does win , what is everybody going to talk about next year \? jarrett took a major step today toward repeating after he and his crew chief , todd parrett , decided after studying the matter for days to bring their ford back to yearago dimensions problems early in the week had prompted the return as i was describing what the car was doing , todd said 'let s go back to what we know works this is a time to find out if it still works , ' jarrett said it does jarrett s is typical of the lengthened careers that drivers are having these days his father , ned , retired from racing at age 34 after having won two winston cup titles at the same age , dale jarrett had never even won a winston cup race now he has eight victories , including four last year earnhardt has a gaudy 70 winston cup victories , though conspicuously none in the daytona 500 it s definitely something i want to do , he said , but it s just one race we have a long season ahead of us and i'm excited the rest of the guys out there racing against us have got a tough year to come clearly he is not getting much sympathy from his competition i think dale has won enough rolex watches that he can hand one over to me , said the 21yearold jeff gordon , who finished second to him today , earning spot no 6 for sunday earnhardt and skinner are teammates and could end up providing drafting help for each other sunday jarrett did n't seem too worried it s a long shot for them to be in position to do that , he said besides , there are very few times where earnhardt needs much help in getting to the front jarrett , who has won two of the last four daytona 500 s , said there is nothing like the feeling it brings i 've gotten to the point where i do n't even want to think about what it would be like going away from here sunday and not winning the race , he said still , he is quite aware that there are several contenders for sunday s glory this shapes up maybe as one of the best 500 s , jarrett said , then added with a smile , if i win , this will be the best 500 pit stops dave marcis , 55 , qualified for his 30th consecutive daytona start and kyle petty got the last qualifying spot after john andretti hit a wall , dropping back in the second race photo dale earnhardt winning a 125mile qualifying race for the daytona 500 yesterday his eighth in a row to earn the no 4 starting spot \( associated press \)

paris , march 7 on the first day of the world indoor track and field championships , wilson kipketer set a world record in the men s 800meter run today and gail devers won the women s 60meter dash the odd thing was that only devers strutted out of the palais omnisports de bercy with a gold medal that was because kipketer s remarkable fourlap tour de force came in the first round of competition , when the world s top runners are usually more concerned with stretching their legs than their limits but kipketer has long loped to his own drummer , and today was no exception a kenyanborn runner who competes for denmark , where he has applied for citizenship , kipketer won the world outdoor 800 title in 1995 in sweden and has spent much of the last two seasons chasing sebastian coe s 16yearold outdoor record of 1 minute 4173 seconds but the indoor record of 1 4484 , set at the 1989 world championships by kenya s paul ereng , proved considerably less resistant to kipketer s long , elegant stride today he had not raced indoors this season , but he was comfortably ahead of ereng s pace after 400 meters and ended up beating the record by nearly a second , finishing in 1 4396 i really was n't planning on breaking the record today , he said , but after the first lap when i saw the time was 20 something seconds i said , 'i have to go for it' the record , which came just before the opening ceremony , earned kipketer a bonus of 50 , 000 he will earn another 50 , 000 if he wins the final on sunday devers , the 30yearold american star , nearly had to stop running after the semifinals with six lanes available , only the top two in each of the three heats advanced and after a shaky start , she finished behind russia s irina privalova and in a tie for second with ekaterini thanou of greece , who also was clocked 715 seconds it was a photo finish , and that usually spells disaster for devers s opponents she beat juliet cuthbert that way to win her first olympic gold medal in the 100 meters in 1992 , defeated merlene ottey to win the world outdoor title in stuttgart the following year and ottey again when devers defended her olympic title in the 100 in atlanta last summer this time , the judges gave the nod to devers by seventhousandths of a second devers started poorly again in the final after 30 meters she was still trailing privalova slightly , but then the russian cried out in pain she had strained a muscle in her right leg and ended up struggling to the finish line as devers cruised to her second world indoor title in 706 seconds she also won in 1993 meet record in hurdles by the new york times indianapolis , march 7 tiffany lott of brigham young university set a meet record in the 55meter hurdles at the national collegiate athletic association indoor track championships today lott won her semifinal in 738 seconds , just missing her world record of 730 , which she set in february in the men s 55meter hurdles semifinals , reggie torian of wisconsin , the big 10 champion , fell after hitting the third hurdle and did not finish torian s fall opened the door for neil gardner of michigan , who finished second to torian in the big ten in the men s team race , george mason s defending champions suffered an unexpected setback when none of its three highly regarded 800 meters entrants qualified for the final but mason s julius achon won his heat of the mile in 3 5875 photo gail devers , right , consoling irina privalova , who strained a leg muscle during the final of the 60 meters \( associated press \)
a cellular control gene whose restraints are flung off by rampant cancer cells in advanced forms of several common tumors has been isolated by two independent teams of researchers the gene has been found to go awry in brain , breast and prostate cancers and may turn up in other tumors as well this is not just another cancer gene , dr bert vogelstein of johns hopkins university said yesterday it is rare to have a genebased discovery that can apply to hundreds of thousands of cases a year and this one certainly meets that criterion since the gene , known as a tumor suppressor gene , is rendered inactive in advanced but not in early tumors , it may serve to designate patients who need aggressive treatment the finding is also of particular interest to biologists trying to fit together the puzzle of cancer cell genetics the two teams that discovered the gene learned within the last few months that they were rivals and both reached the same goal in a dead heat one team , which calls the gene pten , was led by dr ramon parsons of the columbia college of physicians and surgeons in manhattan its results are published in today in the journal science the other team , headed by dr peter a steck of the m d anderson cancer center in houston , wrote in the forthcoming issue of nature genetics that they had found a gene , which they named mmac1 both teams agree they have discovered the same entity after 20 years of work , biologists have now attained a sophisticated though still incomplete understanding of what goes awry in cancer cells some cancer genes are agents whose natural role is to convey messages from the cell s outside environment , telling it to divide and multiply when these genes get damaged by mutations , they become like switches stuck in the on position , and the cell starts to divide uncontrollably , the hallmark of cancer in molecular terms , the on position amounts to adding chemicals known as phosphate groups to other entities in the cell the new gene , on human chromosome 10 , is one that removes phosphate groups , and so is an obvious candidate for being a cellular offswitch surprisingly , none of the 16 tumorsuppressor genes found so far have such a phosphateremoving role unlike several other tumorsuppressor genes , whose exact duties remain unclear , the new gene s natural role may soon be established , making it more interesting to biologists and physicians besides removing phosphate groups , the new gene also has the ability to interact with the cell s structural elements , a tantalizing clue that suggests it could regulate cell adhesion wellbehaved cells stick to each other in ordered sheets , whereas cancer cells are typically disorderly and footloose potentially this gene is suppressing cell migration or invasion , and keeping the cell in one place , dr ramon said unlike several cancer genes so far discovered that are inherited in damaged form and cause hereditary cancer , the chromosome 10 gene is found most often in sporadic cancers , the most common kind , and acquires its mutation in the course of a tumor s evolution this fits with the idea that tumor cells must usually inactivate a series of restraining genes in order to throw off the shackles of the cell s many control mechanisms and gain the full independence of a cancer cell dr michael h wigler of the cold spring harbor laboratory and a coauthor of the columbia team s paper , said it is a fairly good bet that the new gene is important it seems to correlate with the progression of a cancer , dr wigler said so i think we will be able to learn a lot about what makes cancerous cells malignant by understanding what this product does the columbia team found the new gene had been inactivated in nearly a third of the brain tumor cells they examined , in all of the prostate tumor cells and in 6 percent of breast cancers dr steck , of the houston team , began looking nine years ago for a gene that might be connected with glioblastoma multiforme , the most common kind of primary brain cancer having tracked the gene to a region of human chromosome 10 , he enlisted the technical help of dr sean tavtigian of myriad genetics in salt lake city for the final stages of the search dr parsons of the columbia team started his search for the gene just a year ago he , too , had the benefit of highgrade technical help , in this case from a technique invented by dr wigler the technique pinpoints dna that has been ejected from tumor cells part of that success is owed to mike wigler s technology , which is really brilliant and incredibly powerful and this is the best example of it , dr vogelstein said although the new gene is found most often in sporadic cancers , it also occurs in a rare hereditary cancer , cowden disease dr parsons said he started on his pursuit after reading a year ago that cowden s disease was associated with damage to chromosome 10 comparing a number of breast cancers to a map of the human genome prepared by dr eric lander of the whitehead institute in cambridge mass , dr parsons noticed that two of the tumors lacked the milestones found on the genome map in the region where the then unknown gene for cowden disease is located even so , the search was far from over even a single human chromosome is so long that researchers looking for a particular gene can easily get lost in the millions of bases of dna that occur between known milestones the distances are so vast that between here and there you can be going through peru , dr parsons said of his track along the genome dr steck s approach was to add little chunks of normal chromosome 10 to brain cancer cells to see which one of them would restrain growth he commented , they started in breast , we in brain , and we got to the same place he said he hoped the exact functions of the new gene could be determined in a couple of years
union it was the man on the corner who drew the addicts out of their apartment complex and into the rain nancy , joe , jose , mito and junior , scurrying across the street with smiles on their faces and a parcel of used syringes in hand frank b , a 28yearold social worker , gave each a hug , as he has done almost every friday night for the past two years he took their package , placed the syringes in a specially designed disposal bucket and laid out new works needles , cotton wipes , bleach and cookers for everyone there the five retreated to their room , and their rituals i'm here to help them keep from getting aids , not judge them , said frank , who declined to give his last name because such needle exchanges are illegal in new jersey society treats them like dirt , like they were disposable i'm just trying to keep them alive frank is one of dozens of people across new jersey who risk jail time to take clean needles to heroin addicts whose use of dirty needles is the origin of twothirds of the state s 40 , 000 hiv cases two others , diana mccague and thomas scozzare , go to trial tomorrow for running a similar program in new brunswick they each face six months in jail and a 1 , 000 fine frank s project is modeled after theirs , coming after a ripple of death had begun its run through his family and friends i 've lose two uncles and a cousin to aids and i 've got another cousin who s about to die , frank said , adding that his wife , who usually goes out on the needle exchanges with him , has lost several relatives as well in between , we 've lost dozens of friends , he said and they 'd all still be alive if people had n't shared a needle frank has missed only two friday visits since the couple began the exchange in august 1995 the last time was when his baby daughter , brianna , died the couple also lost their first child , aria if we stopped showing up they would lose respect for anyone who followed i could n't think about abandoning them now , he said , adding that michele had stopped working the exchange recently because it is painful to see addicts who are pregnant themselves it s just hard to see them do this to their children , she explained it trips me up sometimes their clients are people whose lives are bound by poverty and addiction nancy has just had a baby , whom the state says she will never see unless she pays the 250 fee to enter a methadone program joe and junior , who are brothers , have 50 years of addiction between them jose started injecting a year and a half ago i just could n't get it up my nose anymore while mito , a former nurse in the cuban red cross , has tried to quit the habit nearly every one of the 13 years he s had it none of them have a job mito is supported by his wife , while joe , junior and jose spend their days panhandling and picking up trash in their bleak neighborhood to support a drug habit that averages 500 to 700 a week nancy , who is 28 years old and married to another addict , says she gets by with the help of some old men they live near each other in sparsely furnished rooms , often pooling their used needles in the same hiding place to avoid having such paraphernalia around during police raids , and scouring the streets together to pick up other needles discarded by those yet to meet frank they say they do n't trust each other because the drug does n't permit it , but they all trust frank you see how we are , how we react to him when he comes , said junior he s our friend such trust took time to develop when frank and michele started showing up on the street , most thought the couple was little more than a clever sting operation bent on making arrests then a cousin took them up on the offer of clean needles in exchange for the dirty he told his addicted friends now the exchange takes in an average of 130 used needles every friday , giving out roughly the same number \( the needles are bought in units of 200 or more , then separated into smaller packages at frank s home \) they are given out in bags that also contain instructions on how to clean them , plus condoms to help prevent addicts from contracting or spreading diseases like hiv and hepatitis our dream is to open a storefront , where we could also offer counseling , set up programs to help these people and have something for their kids , said frank as another addict came by with

fourteenth street has always been something of an orphan , a bawdy , gritty thoroughfare that borders a half dozen neighborhoods but belongs to none but while the street may suffer from a fractured constituency , it does n't lack a cheerleader since 1989 , when he was hired to take over 14th street s sleepy nonprofit development corporation , rob walsh has been something of a oneman juggernaut who has helped transform the area into a case study on how to jumpstart redevelopment today , union square has become famous for chic restaurants and its bustling greenmarket without exaggeration , rob has been largely responsible for the renaissance , said assemblyman steven sanders now , mr walsh has decided to focus his energies elsewhere next month he will leave new york to start a job as head of a nonprofit organization that is working to rejuvenate downtown charlotte , nc , i always said they 'd have to pry me from new york with a crowbar , mr walsh said i guess i 'll have to eat my words in a neighborhood that has seen its share of contention , no one , it seems , is glad to see him go we 've had our fights , but i think rob is going to be hard to replace , said evelyn strouse , who heads the union square community coalition sitting in his 11thfloor office overlooking 14th street , mr walsh reflected on the past decade as construction crews below worked on two new projects that were born of his tireless boosterism a new york university dormitory rising on the site where luchow s once stood and a 22story building on the park s south end that will include a 14screen cinema , several superstores and apartments not everything i set out to do has been done , but i think the momentum is there , said mr walsh , 37 , a garrulous , quickwitted man who lives in nearby stuyvesant town local business leaders agreed that his most important legacy is the genesis apartments , a 94unit building for formerly homeless families that he promoted in the face of vociferous opposition but danny meyer , who owns the union square cafe and gramercy tavern , says mr walsh will be missed for his ability to bring together the kinds of people who might not see eye to eye robert is the greatest maitre d' anyone could want , mr meyer said he remembers everyone s name , knows what they want and knows how to make everyone happy andrew jacobs photo rob walsh outside the refurbished subway entrance at union square \( philip greenberg for the new york times \)

' he said an unmarked black police car was also chasing the suspects , he said asked why the agents had chosen such a busy location to conduct the undercover operation , mr rice said that the agents had planned only a meeting and had not counted on making any arrests why not use an area like that , he said it s where people come and go you blend right in the wounded agent was taken to bellevue hospital center with a heavy police escort in the confusion , a police officer with the highway patrol unit who was accompanying the motorcade to bellevue was slightly injured when a car cut him off , causing him to drive his motorcycle into a pothole and then flip over , the police and witnesses said at bellevue , robert cozzolina , the acting special agent in charge of customs operations , and mr rice , of the drug enforcement agency , said that the agent injured in the shooting was expected to be released within a few days mayor rudolph w giuliani , who was visiting someone else at the hospital , also paid a visit to the agent they spoke briefly about their favorite baseball team , the new york yankees , the mayor said mr rice said that the agent was a casualty of an investigation that was targeting very sophisticated drug traffickers operating at a high level officials estimate that as much as 13 billion in drug money , for instance , is sent from new york city to colombia each year last year , the treasury department cracked down on what it said was one of the most common methods of money laundering the small remittance stores in areas like queens where immigrants can wire money to relatives in their native countries the treasury department imposed a 750 limit on transactions at 1 , 600 remittance shops that were suspected of laundering most of the money photos a crowd of police officers gathered yesterday at the site of a failed sting operation in which a federal agent was injured and a suspect killed investigators used numbers to label bullets scattered in the mcdonald s parking lot at 10th avenue and west 34th street after a man died in a shootout between undercover agents and suspected drug dealers yesterday \( photographs by chang w lee the new york times \) \( pg b5 \)
closure , the national buzzword of the week , is the panacea for all our ills no sooner was timothy mcveigh found guilty than it was universally declared that closure would arrive soon for the loved ones of his 168 victims the verdict brings instant closure to some troubled american institutions , too the fbi proved that it could still get its man \( even if it did bungle evidence \) , and the legal system proved that it could still work \( rip , judge ito \) there s even closure for the press , which is already racing on to paula jones closure truly is a balm for grief , and we can only hope that the mutilated families of oklahoma city will find it but if the rest of us are now lulled into complacency by a wellconducted trial s fair outcome , that s not closure it s amnesia timothy mcveigh did n't come from nowhere but was an exemplar , however extreme , of a diverse , violent rightwing fringe , ranging from neonazis to gunabsolutists to christian identity white supremacists , that most journalists ignored prior to april 19 , 1995 now that his case is closed , will this terrorist netherworld be forgotten again \? though mr mcveigh may be going away , his political bedfellows and comrades in arms are not yet unless a terrorist incident occurs in full view of a tv camera as in the stillunsolved bombing at the olympics it no longer commands the national media the mass carnage of the oklahoma city bombing has so raised the bar of horror that other incidents are now minor not for their victims , however abraham foxman of the antidefamation league , which monitors militia activity , has noted a dramatic increase in militiarelated crime over the past 18 months since oklahoma city , two serious bombing plots involving militia cells in oklahoma and michigan were foiled in midstream by arrests the targets included an adl office in houston and a federal building in battle creek abortion clinics have not escaped so easily this year alone , bombings and arson have struck clinics from portland , ore , to atlanta to name just the most violent of 14 recent incidents categorized as extreme by the national abortion federation remarking on how little attention is paid to these crimes , gloria feldt , planned parenthood s president , says there seems to be an inability to recognize that this terrorism is terrorism is n't bombing a women s health center terrorism \? if anything , planned parenthood s frustration right now is a replay of just three summers ago , when it held a press conference in new york to call attention to its selfdefensive research into violent farright activity threatening its members its lonely findings were all but ignored until oklahoma city , at which point the justice department and journalists alike came running for valuable leads into militias and other terrorist groups that had turned up on planned parenthood s nationwide radar screen with the national rifle association no longer talking of jackbooted government thugs , even the aboveground political activity of the far right is now little noted no one seems to know or care , for instance , that william pierce , whose 1978 novel the turner diaries inspired timothy mcveigh , spent last month promoting his neonazi organization , the national alliance , at conclaves starring david duke in cities like cleveland and tampa or that norman olson , the michigan militiaman examined by the senate and ted koppel two years ago , this week unveiled new \( and on the internet , widespread \) wacodriven logic pronouncing the mcveigh verdict proof of government culpability in oklahoma city the journalist frederick clarkson , whose new book , eternal hostility , is an uptodate guide to our rightist factions , points out that it s an authentic crisis of democracy when people seek to blame the government for all ills and forsake the ballot box as a means of change chip berlet , another longtime analyst of the far right , speculates that perhaps as many as five million americans adhere to the most enraged varieties of rightwing populism and are part of the recruitment pool for neonazi demagogues waiting to exploit and channel unresolved anger toward bloodshed and terror thank goodness for closure none of this is our problem anymore
washington , aug 6 following are excerpts from president clinton s news conference today on the south lawn of the white house , from a transcript provided by the federal news service , a private transcription company opening remarks before i begin , let me first say that i join with all americans in expressing our deepest condolences for the victims of the terrible plane crash yesterday in guam i have spoken with governor gutierrez , and i want to commend him , the hundreds of volunteers , and the united states military personnel who are working so hard on the response and the rescue effort the national transportation safety board will lead the investigation of the crash with technical assistance from the faa and other agencies as needed now , today i want to briefly review what our nation has accomplished during the first seven months of this year , and to spell out the opportunities and the obligations that we have to continue that progress as i have said over and over again , our common mission must be to prepare our people for the 21st century , to master the challenges and seize the opportunities of this remarkable time i believe the american people are coming to see that and coming to believe that as we pass through this period of remarkable change , the future holds far greater rewards than risks if our people , our government , and our other institutions are ready for tomorrow in these past months , we have seen how the politics of the vital center can work to make progress on many of our most difficult problems we ratified the chemical weapons convention , a landmark treaty that will protect our soldiers and our citizens from the threat of poison gas we reached agreement in madrid to open the doors of nato to poland , hungary , and the czech republic , while creating a stronger partnership with russia and ukraine , to build a europe that is undivided , democratic , and at peace these past months have been a remarkably fruitful time for bipartisan action in the national interests , and i think we have to continue that work i should mention , too , that we worked in a bipartisan fashion to maintain our normal trade relationships with china , reaching out to a quarter of the world s population while making our differences with the government over human rights and other matters clear these are major accomplishments , all achieved with the support of americans , both democrats and republicans they have strengthened our nation and yesterday , we took an historic action to eliminate the annual budget deficits we have been seeing , and piling up , since 1969 the first step toward that was taken back in 1993 when we abandoned supplyside trickledown economics , opened a new chapter in fiscal responsibility with a new strategy of growth , based on reducing the deficit , investing in education and training , opening the world to trade and american products and services even before yesterday , the deficit had been reduced by over 75 percent as a result of this strategy but yesterday , when i signed into law the first balancedbudget act in a generation , we know that it will add to the longterm economic growth potential of the united states we know , too , that it includes the largest increase in college aid since the gi bill 50 years ago , the largest increase in children s health since medicaid was enacted , first , over 30 years ago today , i have some more good news our efforts have led to an even lower deficit than we had previously projected in this , the fourth year of the fiveyear economic plan adopted in 1993 , we now expect the deficit to drop to 37 billion yet , without the bipartisan balanced budget we just passed , our budget officials estimate the deficit would rise next year , to 50 to 100 billion , and stay at that level for years to come with our bipartisan balanced budget plan , we now expect it not only to reach balance by 2002 , but to have a surplus in excess of 20 billion , and to be able to maintain that for several years thereafter there are still big challenges and tough decisions that we have to make beyond the balanced budget , however , if we 're going to keep our economy growing , and keep our people fully prepared for the new century to meet that , members of congress from both sides of the aisle and americans from all walks of life must summon the will and spirit that led to the balanced budget we have a lot of work to do in the rest of this year first , if we expect to keep our economy strong and growing , we must continue to invest in the education and training of our people , and we must succeed in our push for high national standards and tests to make sure our students , our schools , and our teachers are doing the job second , we must tackle the tough issue of entitlement reform we have to make tough choices to strengthen and protect medicare and social security over the long run they are the two most important social service innovations of the 20th century this is not simply a matter of fiscal responsibility it is also a matter of honoring the duties we owe both to our parents and to the next generation the balancedbudget bill i signed yesterday sets up a bipartisan commission to reform medicare this fall , along with the members of the congress , i will appoint the members of the commission and they will get to work we 'll also tackle other issues to strengthen our families , exploring ways to improve child care in america and continuing our efforts to reduce the use of tobacco among our children
to the editor i'm glad to know good work continues at robert redford s sundance theater lab \( sundance has a secret to tell , aug 24 \) but let me offer a few words , if only in eulogy , for the old lab my two weeks at the sundance lab of 1994 remain among the most significant events of my writing career i was an unproduced playwright my play kim s sister was just read at a table , true , but at that table it was examined , challenged , played with , prodded , criticized , praised and transformed my daily rehearsals with the director liz diamond and the talented cast \( none as famous as glenn close , though \) led me to rewrite my play completely specifically and intentionally , the lack of production values staging , design , directorial interpretation allowed us all to focus on the work at hand because i knew that the play would not be performed at that time , i was able to take risks and make discoveries that would have been impossible elsewhere kim s sister was produced the next year at new york stage and film peter segal brooklyn
paterson a statesubsidized children s insurance program called children first , envisioned by governor whitman 18 months ago , is expected to start in september , officials said last week but the program , with 5 million in seed money allocated by the legislature in june , will begin only in a limited way because full financing to cover the 100 , 000 children eligible remains uncertain the program would start by offering policies to the parents of 5 , 000 children under the seed grant to insure all the eligible children , the state would require federal block grant money , donations by large corporations and health maintenance organizations in the state , or profits from the proposed national settlement with the tobacco industry , none of which is certain at this time seventeen percent of our charitycare dollars are spent on children , so we know that if we can insure kids , it will do some good here , said the health commissioner , len fishman the program is part of a larger state initiative to deal with an estimated 11 million uninsured new jerseyans care for them has usually come through a network of charity hospitals , their bills partly covered through 453 million from the state s unemployment insurance fund and matching federal grants the rest is covered by hospital revenue but the mandate to use the unemployment insurance fund for charity care will lapse at the end of the year , leaving state health officials scrambling for other permanent and costeffective financing children first is one of these , and a 36member panel of health experts , lawyers and business leaders was commissioned last month to find others we need to put some order in chaos , so that we are not chasing a patchwork of funds after every election year and people are given the sort of health care that assures them some semblance of health , said sister jane f brady , who runs st joseph s hospital and medical center here and sits on the committee as with all publicly administered charity care in the state , there are many uncertainties left to wade through in children first until recently , there was no source of money for the program a proposal to raise the cigarette tax last year failed in the legislature and the state has continued to resist any structuring of the program until it figures out its share of the 16 billion recently promised by president clinton for a national children s health care policy , and what strings will be attached governor whitman is also waiting for news from the proposed 368 billion national tobacco settlement , which is to be split among the states if it ever passes congressional muster she has pledged at least 100 million from any settlement to help pay for lowincome health care in new jersey with little known about either the financing or structure of children first , the corporations and hmo s expected to contribute to the program have been reluctant to commit themselves we have members who participate in other states' programs who would be willing to participate here if there was just some more flesh on the bone , said paul r langevin , a spokesman for the new jersey hmo association , whose members insure more than 90 percent of the state s residents in commercial managedcare plans according to the department of health and senior services , children first would emphasize preventive health care , offering comprehensive medical coverage it would be open to families with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level \( 39 , 000 for a family of four , for example \) who cannot receive health coverage through employers or a public program those families who qualified would be enrolled in an hmo , paying a monthly contribution of between 5 and 15 health care experts said the state was likely to use the administrative structure of health access new jersey to sign up applicants and track their progress that twoyearold program provides subsidized health insurance for people who cannot afford a policy although the original goal was to broaden it to cover all those who use charity care , the program is being phased out by the state in favor of children first one of those hoping to enroll his son in this latest incarnation of subsidized care is slawomir winsiewski , who laid out his troubles as an uninsured worker while waiting for 10yearold jakub to see a doctor at st joseph s his tale began last fall with the loss of a job at a warehouse and the insurance that it provided for jakub , who has cystic fibrosis when that job ended , he did not find another until spring although he now works 60 hours a week as a landscaper for a large company , his family still lacks companysponsored insurance and making less than 20 , 000 a year , mr winsniewski cannot afford private insurance on his own it s tough , he said , shaking his head it s really tough photo slawomir winsiewski and his son , jakub , 10 , at st joseph s hospital in paterson jakub , who has cystic fibrosis , is not covered by medical insurance \( john sotomayor the new york times \)
if architects have visions and musicians have needs , why did so much go wrong in the building of lincoln center \? momentous decisions of design and financing attend the birth of any arts center , but they are eventually reducible to one the needs of the arts versus the art of the possible i suggest that the first has been sacrificed in the name of the second in so many ways , lincoln center , now immersed in the second season of its namesake summer festival , has been an enormous success over its 35 years of life the location is central the address is prestigious the publicity flows endlessly the surrounding neighborhood has flowered the four main theaters have elbowed their way to the center of new york s , and thus the country s , musical life carnegie hall may have the patina of tradition , but lincoln center has the television cameras are lincoln center s tenants happy \? are their customers \? are the needs of both parties met \? you may find adaptability and resignation , but true contentment \? rarely in one way or another , the buildings have let their inhabitants down , but with little hope of significant change , we have gotten used to them i wonder how many of us , in our heart of hearts , really like lincoln center , yet we go there anyway it is where things happen the new york state theater , the metropolitan opera house , avery fisher hall and alice tully hall \( reading the map of lincoln center s musical buildings from south to north \) emerged between 1962 and 1969 the reallife neighborhoods of west side story were swept aside to make room for them , and more than five million patrons drop in every year , buying tickets to operas , plays , dance programs , concerts and recitals the city owns the land a nonprofit corporation , the buildings crassly put , lincoln center is new york s shopping mall for the performing arts if you ca n't get into carmen at the met , bruckner at the new york philharmonic is a few hundred feet away arnold toynbee told us that civilizations thrive more readily in harsh climates than in ecological paradises for the making of music , lincoln center has certainly challenged rather than welcomed artists struggle daily with bad decisions made years ago , and these struggles , waged against conditions now inscribed in stone , may actually represent the most gripping theater lincoln center has to offer lincoln center has 11 constituents dance , film , theater , libraries , schools but music is the topic here , so first of all , how do these theaters let us hear \? not terribly well , in most cases acousticians wax longwinded about the science of sound , but the brief history of lincoln center demonstrates the crapshoot that is acoustics why else have the state theater and fisher hall \( originally philharmonic hall \) been continually tinkered with and on several major occasions completely overhauled \? repairmen dominate the acoustical trade today indeed , rejiggering the mistakes of colleagues is big business for firms , any one of which might consider hindsight inc as an appropriate trade name another subject to think about is fit are the various artists of lincoln center operating in the right places \? wynton marsalis seems happy to be heading up lincoln center s jazz division , but he still has n't found a hall in it where jazz really belongs \( a contemplated theatrical space across broadway on 64th street may be helpful \) new york state theater for emerging voices , a dilemma in a paradox the state theater gets in opera s way a good place for dance , say those who know , it does not serve the new york city opera well backstage areas are small for operatic purposes , the wings even more claustrophobic while operating areas are cramped , the state theater s towering audience space is the opposite , reducing any hope of intimacy putting on broadway musicals as part of its season is one of the city opera s brighter ideas in recent years , but these entertainments are lost in the state theater the need for significant amplification makes the productions seem artificial the distances make them cold acoustically , the state theater is certainly better than it was that is , after several significant makeovers in the last 15 years its stage floor was designed to muffle the sound of dancing feet over the years , that floor has done much the same for singing voices the city opera is caught in paradox being an important way station for emerging american voices yet presenting an environment that can strain young techniques the devisers of lincoln center and of the city opera never wanted each other in the first place the new york city ballet was desirable indeed , necessary to the center , but the city opera s cutrate fare would undermine competing activities of other constituents , all offered at higher prices the city opera feared the inevitable comparisons with its huge , international nextdoor neighbor and was right to do so but it also knew that if it stayed at the city center , the met would create its own budget opera at the state theater and squeeze the city opera out of business accepting the city opera made lincoln center s job of dealing with the city easier , so it did
while growing up in fullerton , calif , miles simon was always carolina dreaming michael jordan , james worthy and sam perkins powder blue tar heels dean smith it was so clear that carolina was the place for him i envisioned going to north carolina , simon said sunday that always has been my dream school that dream is dead simon is working on some new dreams for the university of arizona wildcats , whom he led into the final four with a gamehigh 30 points against providence in the southeast regional final so there will not be any pangs of what if when simon takes the court for the wildcats against north carolina on saturday in a national collegiate athletic association tournament semifinal game simon , a 6foot5inch junior guard who is arizona s secondleading scorer \( 17 points a game going into the providence matchup \) , did not play in arizona s 8372 victory over north carolina in the season opener at the hall of fame tipoff classic because he was academically ineligible for the first 11 games of the season but he did make the trip , and he got a chance to shake hands with smith there was not enough time to talk about the death of simon s dream they stopped recruiting me , said simon , who attended mater dei high school in southern california they had written me letters for a long time finally , coach smith expressed in a letter that he felt solid at the 2guard position with dante calabria and donald williams , and they did n't want to overrecruit that s fine they did the best thing for their program i ca n't complain about being at arizona it would sound silly to complain about being on one of four teams left playing for the division i championship the wildcats \( 229 \) were the fifthplace team in the pacific10 this year , and with three pac10 teams in the round of 16 \( stanford and ucla being the others \) , arizona was considered the long shot at making the final four that is because the wildcats had to get past kansas in the southeast regional semifinal they did , and the road opened up the wildcats are going to the final four for the third time , but they have never made it to the title game coach lute olson brings the only final four team to indianapolis that does not have a senior in the starting lineup , although the freshman point guard mike bibby has played beyond his years in the last two games , against kansas and providence , scoring a combined 48 points none of the teams are loaded with national basketball association lottery picks , so arizona believes it has as much a chance of winning the whole thing as anyone besides the quickness of bibby , simon and forward michael dickerson , the wildcats have been getting a lot of help inside from forwards a j bramlett and bennett davison and guard jason terry has been coming off the bench and averaging double figures in scoring he has been able to replace simon and keep him fresh olson has no illusions that the tar heels his team will meet in indianapolis bear any resemblance to the team arizona beat in november north carolina now is a totally different basketball team than we played early , he said again , i 'll say the same thing that i said prior to the kansas game this team is not going to be in awe or frightened of anyone we know from carolina s standpoint they 're going to look at it as a revenge game we 're going to come out and play as hard as we can play and compete as hard as we can compete simon also repeated something that he said before the wildcats played the jayhawks show respect , but not fear we respect carolina a great deal , he said but as much as we respect them , they 've got to respect us

well after the era of betty grable and well before that of cindy crawford , a most unlikely pinup girl reigned from the walls of men s dormitories in schools across america she was ravishing , of course , and halfnaked but she had none of the invitational passivity common to gorgeous women in posters her arms were crossed at defensive angles across her bare breasts and her gaze electric , quizzical , haunted seemed less to say come hither than approach with caution if you got too close , you were definitely in danger of being burned that was in the mid1960 s , in the days when vanessa redgrave , the model in question , could still be referred to as a bird \( swinging london parlance for an attractive female \) the image was from blow up , michelangelo antonioni s elliptical , brooding fashion shoot of a film in which ms redgrave appeared for only 10 or 15 minutes that was more than long enough for the actress , playing a nameless woman of edgy sensuality and unspeakable secrets , to emerge as a disruptively vital presence in a movie that otherwise existed only on its surface the same disquieting energy could be felt from the blackandwhite poster as a 12yearold boy , i had to take it down from its place of honor over my bed who could sleep with that confrontational stare burning through the night \? vanessa redgrave , who opens on march 13 at the joseph papp public theater as the star and director of shakespeare s antony and cleopatra , is 60 now she is still beautiful and still possessed of a luminosity that is just short of radioactive and she still troubles and baffles an audience that really wants only to worship her from the time of her triumphant portrayal as rosalind in as you like it at the stratford festival in england in 1961 , she has been garlanded with an embarrassment of superlatives she was hailed as a goddess by the rigorous british critic bernard levin both pauline kael and vincent canby found themselves comparing her to garbo in describing her on film analyzing her stage work , writers have often been reduced to the language of lovestruck sonneteers force of nature crops up frequently so do phrases like a creature of fire and light indeed , for years she seemed poised to inherit the long empty mantle of sarah bernhardt and eleanora duse , as an actress with a depth of technique matched by depth of passion and presence in this regard , there is still no other performer who approaches her but ms redgrave is uncomfortable on altars \( though not on a soapbox \) seldom has a star of her stature seemed so blatantly careless of image or less eager to be loved for herself the divine vanessa , the performer who seems to fling herself over a precipice every time she creates a character , is also the infernal vanessa , the confirmed trotskyite who brings the same intensity to pamphleteering and stump speeches , able to alienate millions with a single phrase \( the most notorious zionist hoodlums , used in her oscar acceptance speech for julia in 1978 to describe those protesting her presence \) this seemed perfectly fine in the 1960 s , when she marched for nuclear disarmament and against the war in vietnam that was what youth did in those days but as the decades have gone by , with ms redgrave championing the cause of palestinian rights in language that was anything but circumspect , even her liberal sympathizers have become impatient shut up , vanessa ! or grow up , vanessa ! implicitly runs the usual criticisms look at jane fonda , her onetime leftist soul mate , who neatly metamorphosed from vixen starlet to aggressive radical to exercise entrepreneur to corporate trophy wife ms redgrave , by contrast , has simply and determinedly become more of what she always was the british director peter hall , who oversaw ms redgrave s harrowing performance in tennessee williams s orpheus descending , famously described in his diary what he perceived as the essential contradiction in the actress , after witnessing the miracle of her 1979 appearance in ibsen s lady from the sea you could see right through the skin to the emotions , the thoughts , the hopes , the fears underneath but here s the paradox what vanessa says politically is , to me , insane , and i believe that to her lies are truth if they support her ideology so how can she express such truth , such sincerity , such lack of hypocrisy in her art \? in life , which is true , she is false in art , which is false , she is true is it really such a paradox , though \? truth , as mr hall suggests , is in the eye of the beholder , and truth , with a capital t , is what ms redgrave clearly believes she pursues on all levels of her life she does so with a mixture of supreme arrogance and supreme humility as an actress , she is fearless , endlessly empathetic , willing to look ridiculous and at times perversely foolhardy she embodies the same traits offstage , even when it means suffering weighty professional consequences \( such as being dropped from the american tour of the play lettice and lovage in 1991 \)
some users of two of the most popular world wide web sites , espn sportszone and nbacom , suffered a security scare earlier this week hundreds of consumers of the online services , both operated by the starwave corporation , received an electronicmail message telling them that access to their credit card numbers had been gained the message was signed by an anonymous organization seeking to make the internet a safe place for the consumer to do business the last eight digits of each recipient s credit card number was included in the message as proof you are the victim of a careless abuse of privacy and security , the email message said this is one of the worst implementations of security we 've seen starwave , in bellevue wash , confirmed that its system had suffered a breach of security and that 2 , 397 customers' files were potentially exposed we are taking this very seriously , said patrick naughton , president and chief technology officer of starwave mr naughton said that none of the credit card numbers had been used the company , which became aware of the situation in the past few days , according to mr naughton , has sent out email and postal mail to consumers who purchased merchandise through its online stores , alerting them to the problem only those customers were affected , mr naughton stressed , and he added that the problem did not affect subscribers of the feebased portion of espn sportszone , who are also required to give their credit card information on line we have no reason to believe that the perpetrator intends to commit fraud with your credit card , the letter said but as a precautionary measure you should contact your credit card company mr naughton said that the company had taken the online stores on the espn and nba sites off line until the investigation was completed the rest of both sites remain unaffected espn sportszone receives more than five million page views a day , starwave officials said mr naughton said that the problem appeared different from previous security scares on the internet , which involved hackers who broke into sites by breaking codes , or finding holes in the technology in this case , he said , he suspected that the information might have been retrieved by securing a password from a third party starwave uses 1800proteam , a company in palm city , fla , to process its online orders proteam , which is a unit of genesis direct operations llc , could not be reached for comment it s like one degree of separation mr naughton said we knew there was a welldesigned hole so we could get to the information , he said we presumed that we could keep it inside it s a human integrity problem your weakest link is always going to be the integrity of your people , said mark rasch , a lawyer specializing in online security and cyberlaw fundamentally , this is no different than the employee going into the back of the store , through the file cabinet , and picking out credit card receipts the difference is that now the employee could post the credit card number on the web for everyone to see mr naughton said it was an isolated incident and the company had taken steps to remedy the problem
they come from all over new jersey , manhattan , queens and long island , by train , bus and foot latin american laborers , looking for a day s work and they congregate in the parking lot of a dunkin' donuts in east flushing , much to the distress of the proprietor look at them , said lou keen , the owner of the doughnut shop for the last six years every time a van or truck pulls up , they 're all over it like sea gulls on crumbs people do n't want to get out of their cars , they 're so afraid , and it s costing me money the situation began in the late 80 s attracted by the spacious lot on the corner of 147th street and northern boulevard , a few immigrants started congregating there , easily seen by builders looking for cheap labor spurred by community complaints that the men were causing traffic snarls and were gambling and defecating in the nearby alleys , the 109th precinct placed a squad car at the corner from 6 am to 9 am but the day laborers would simply move down the block to 149th street or roosevelt avenue the pastor of st john vianney roman catholic church on 35th avenue offered to let the men gather at his parking lot but many said they have refused to do so because it is off the main road and not visible to potential employers , and so they still gather by the doughnut shop on some days , as many as 100 men in work clothes stand around the corner it is america , yes \? said one laborer , carlos gutierrez it is a right to stand where you want part of the problem , mr keen said , is that fewer many police officers now frequent his establishment , perhaps because police department brass , intent on improving the image of the department , have for several years quietly discouraged officers from spending time at doughnut shops and delis mr keen received a memo from the police department last year , reminding him that it is illegal to provide free coffee or pastries to officers and the police say their hands have been tied since the state s highest court ruled in 1993 that laws prohibiting loitering were unconstitutional we cannot harass people because it s against their constitutional right to assemble , said officer peter cheung , a community affairs officer at the 109th precinct in 1994 , gov mario m cuomo signed into law a provision that allows cities to enact noloitering statutes if the loitering contributes to illegal activities like prostitution , gambling or drinking in public cities like albany have passed such laws , but in new york , it sits inert in the council , said evan stavisky , a spokesman for assemblyman brian m mclaughlin , a flushing democrat we 're still waiting , mr stavisky said many of these men are not looking for work what we 're talking about is giving the police the authority to break up a nuisance the laborers , however , contend that they are not a nuisance , just men trying to eke out a living i have a wife i need to support , said pavis martes , 30 , who arrived from el salvador four years ago and lives in new jersey i drove a taxi for a month and now i have none it s a lie that there is much work at 7 am last wednesday , mr keen dialed 911 five minutes later , the police arrived the laborers scrambled , some ducking into the doughnut shop for a cup of coffee with the corner cleared , the police left and the men returned see \? mr keen said like pigeons i wish the cops would stay for a doughnut charlie leduff photo a group of laborers gathered at 147th street and northern boulevard \( john sotomayor the new york times \)
like other big news organizations , the knightridder newspaper chain spends millions of dollars to maintain reporters and news bureaus overseas yet much of this expensive coverage never makes its way into most of its papers knightridder s solution it is taking the control of its foreign bureaus away from its four big newspapers and placing their reporters under the direction of a single foreign desk in washington the move has upset senior editors at the papers that will lose bureaus they had operated as their own , but management said the move was needed both to coordinate overseas coverage and to try to resolve a problem facing many big newspapers how to make overseas reporting meaningful to american readers still , some editors believe this shift in control of the bureaus will mean that knightridder foreign correspondents will spend more time covering breaking news with short , quick articles and less time developing more indepth articles about trends overseas reporters are also likely to feel that they have less say about how their articles are edited than when they reported to a particular newspaper clark hoyt , a vice president for news at knightridder s miami headquarters , said that the move was not aimed at cutting the 2 million a year the company spends to support eight overseas bureaus and that there were no plans to close any of them foreign bureaus operated independently by knightridder papers would also not be affected , mr hoyt said , although the bureaus would be expected to coordinate coverage more closely with the chain when the bureaus were set up around 1980 , there was a lot of discussion about whether they should be centralized or distributed among the newspapers , mr hoyt said the final decision was that they would be operated by what were then our four largest papers , but that they would operate as a trust for all the papers and be responsive to the needs of all knightridder papers knightridder then opened eight overseas bureaus and awarded two each to the philadelphia inquirer , the detroit free press , the miami herald and the san jose mercury news in california but the bureaus in moscow , rio de janeiro , jerusalem , beijing , tokyo , mexico city , warsaw and harare , zimbabwe soon became largely associated with their parent newspapers in addition to its knightridder bureaus , the inquirer also has its own reporters in london , rome , south africa and the middle east when i was in detroit we ran the coverage and we promoted people to our bureaus , and we were satisfied with that , but i would say the other knightridder papers were not satisfied , said david lawrence , who had been the editor of the free press , and who is now publisher of the miami herald as mr hoyt pointed out in a june 13 memo outlining the change , while the miami herald used all 65 articles filed by its jerusalem correspondent , john donnelly , in the first four months of this year , no other knightridder paper used more than 4 , and most used none i think it ought to work to our benefit , said glenn guzzo , managing editor of the akron beacon journal , which has no foreign bureaus , but is one of the founding papers of the knightridder chain we are not prepared to run the foreign stories that are generated by knightridder correspondents at the length they are now being written , and we have difficulty finding out , in fact , what is being written and when it is coming case in point last week , when hong kong reverted to chinese rule , the beacon journal covered the event with articles only from the news services of the washington post and the new york times the only knightridder coverage of one of the biggest stories of the year in the beacon journal was a sunday piece , filed well enough ahead to let mr guzzo know it was available if you do n't tell us what s coming , how can we use it \? he asked maxwell e p king , editor of the philadelphia inquirer , said , i have my differences about the direction that this is going , but i do not argue with the assessment that this is a problem mr king said he tried to persuade mr hoyt to allow the host newspapers to retain control of the bureaus and to focus on improving coordination but as mr hoyt pointed out in an interview , that had been the original intent , and it had not worked the inquirer operates knightridder bureaus in beijing and moscow , as well as having reporters in four other areas overseas in his memo , mr hoyt also spoke of changing the nature of foreign coverage , a move that is likely to raise concerns among knightridder s foreign reporters a questionnaire being prepared for the senior management at all knightridder papers will include questions about whether bureaus should focus on news or on longer , indepth pieces should concentrate on certain subjects , like world trade and economics , or be general , and on how foreign pieces should be made more local for american readers our coverage has been very enterprisedriven as opposed to breakingnews driven , mr king said i think from the note that they will want to do more newsdriven and shorter pieces , and it s a particular source of my worry , that the jobs will still be satisfying and sustaining for career journalists if that happens
rio de janeiro , july 20 faced with rampant illegal logging , the brazilian government is opening timber reserves in the amazon rain forest to commercial loggers in what it describes as a project to combine economic potential with controlled development the forest reserves cover 5 , 440 , 000 acres , an area roughly the size of new jersey they were mapped out during brazil s military dictatorship , which lasted from 1964 to 1985 , with the prospect of their eventual use by the timber industry the government said last week that it would use the areas to demonstrate logging practices that could sustain surrounding communities and the environment we are n't going to turn around policy in the amazon simply through taxes , said eduardo martins , the head of brazil s environmental agency we have to create a socalled positive agenda in forestry that will allow people to do this as a stable , economically viable activity , creating work in a region that needs alternatives while brazil has in the past opened reserves to logging , the new concessions are the first that will be sold for logging in the amazon rain forest the initial opening will cover 12 , 355 acres near the tapajos river in para state , with further licenses scheduled for sale later this year and next the contracts will run for a year the environmental agency selected these areas for logging because it has complete inventories on all the trees there mr martins said that loggers who obtain the concessions would be subject to limits on the amount extracted and other rules that would insure that the same forest could be used for logging again within 20 years the concessions could also include requirements for building housing for local residents or for fulfilling other obligations to the surrounding communities the plan drew mixed reactions from environmentalists israel klabin , a pulp and paper scion who now runs a riobased foundation for sustainable development , acknowledged , if we would be all the way orthodox about what we are doing , we would say that no development at all is best but we have to see the complete impossibility of treating part of the country outside the pragmatic reality of what goes on around the world , he said mr klabin added that he feared the concessions were being granted before the government had created adequate monitoring systems and goals for forest management do we have the right definition of sustainability \? he said we do n't do we have the right system of inspection and monitoring \? we do n't ideologically the concessions are right , but they 're too early gustavo fonseca , vice president for brazil of conservation international , a washingtonbased environmental group , agreed he predicted that opening the amazon s forests for concessions would have minimal impact on conservation or sustainable development while illegal deforestation is hardly a new problem in brazil , the recent arrival of several asian logging companies , which bought up failing domestic logging companies , has fueled concerns of a rapid acceleration in deforestation a recent government study found that 80 percent of the timber extracted from the amazon is being removed illegally while opening onceprotected frontiers for logging , he said , the amazonian concessions would do nothing to alter the advantages for logging companies to strip a forest quickly and move on mr fonseca added that 999 percent of the amazon is being exploited without any control or design tarso resende de azeveda , the executive director of imaflora , a sao paulo based group that rates the environmental soundness of logging operations , said the government sale of licenses in the tapajos reserve would destroy the ecosystem that supports hundreds of people who live along the tapajos river it s not so much that the logging itself is damaging , but it s a vector that brings in roads and machinery and people , that end up changing an area , he said some also criticized the logic of remedying illegal logging by opening new reserves it s a bit ingenuous to suggest that by opening another area to logging that is legal , one is actually helping the environment , said russ mittermeier , the president of conservation international in addition , he said seven previously unknown species of primates had been found in the amazon since 1990 none of them in the jungle s protected areas while the federal environmental agency may have done an inventory of the trees , it had not studied the different species in national forests earmarked for logging the big concern to me is to give out an area as a concession without knowing the biodiversity that s in it , mr mittermeier said
the time bind when work becomes home and home becomes work by arlie russell hochschild illustrated 316 pp new york metropolitan books henry holt company 2250 the photograph accompanying the 1953 fortune article that william h whyte expanded into the organization man showed a tide of humanity \( to the extent that guys in fedoras qualify as a tide of humanity \) flowing across a train platform in park forest , ill , over this caption 5 57 , back from the loop the unmistakable message was that ominous big corporations were turning us into a race of workautomatons today , however , looking at the picture , you ca n't help thinking that they would have had to leave the office not much past 5 to make that train , and that their wives had probably been home all day attending to home , community and children what a leisurely life ! arlie russell hochschild s book the time bind is based on the same kind of intensive firsthand research into midwestern corporate life that whyte did , except that she is a sociologist rather than a journalist , and so does n't tell us the real name of the town or the company she spent three summers at the headquarters of amerco , an enlightened multinational in the lowkey town of spotted deer , and found that in most families both spouses put in much longer hours than just the husbands had back in the 1950 s ten to elevenhour workdays are common \( that s 8 am to 6 or 7 pm \) , and family life is brutally squeezed ms hochschild writes in a calm , understanding tone that tends to disguise how truly subversive and depressing her message is subversive , because although we 've already heard , in juliet schor s book the overworked american and elsewhere , that our hours are too long , the blame is usually laid at the feet of a demanding new economy it is n't our fault ms hochschild says we work too much because we want to because we like it better at work than at home depressing , because in her account home has changed from a refuge into an arena of stress , and children are the victims at amerco an elaborate series of familyfriendly personnel schemes with hilariously earnest names \( like the worklife balance program \) go mostly unused only 53 of 21 , 000 employees , none of them men , have chosen to work part time in response to the arrival of a new baby fewer than 1 percent share a job and 1 percent of amerco employees work from home , though the company permits it most employees do n't even use all their vacation days a minor reason for all this office time is that amerco is a pretty workaholic place where employees are judged more on input \( that is , hours worked \) than on output what matters is how much time you put into the job , the volume of work , one of ms hochschild s interviewees is told by her boss the major reason is volition no dark satanic mills in spotted deer ! over and over ms hochschild conveys amerco s employees' attitude toward their work by using such sundappled terms as sweet joy , fun , carefree , emotionally supportive and more interesting than life at home one interviewee tells her , i come to work to relax ms hochschild has exposed something that feels like an unacknowledged home truth , america s clean little secret work , not even the substance of it but the buzzy surface feeling of office life , is for many of us a source of intense pleasure amerco has become somewhat homelike even , ms hochschild insists , for the hourly workers in its welllit , fairly quiet , relatively pleasant factories at work people have buddies , they carry on flirtations , their birthdays are celebrated , they even have staged commitment ceremonies \( to the company , that is \) home , on the other hand , has become another workplace the increased presence of women has led to a mild feminization of work , with more emphasis placed on cooperation and support , but also to a pronounced masculinization of home , where efficiency is now the overriding concern parenthood , too , is judged by outputs , not inputs one mother measures her performance by how well her children were doing , not how much time she spent with them children are subjected to factorystyle speedups , hurried from one place to another all day and made to squeeze all their emotional needs into the hour or less that their parents have to spare in the evening home has developed its version of corporate outsourcing and downsizing , with many traditional maternal functions offloaded to baby sitters and therapists in one of ms hochschild s most horrifying anecdotes , two parents dash off to give presentations at work on a day when they know their son has to be taken to the hospital because of a medical emergency ms hochschild notes that hallmark has introduced a new line of cards for parents who are too busy to see their children , which say things like sorry i ca n't be there to tuck you in a cycle develops home , because it is continually shorted , keeps getting messier sullen children , resentful spouses , inconvenient stepchildren , elderly parents and manipulative exes lurk there relationships at work , which get the nourishment of time , become deeper and richer one executive , typically of ms hochschild s subjects , finds dealings with his office children subordinates , that is more rewarding than those with his fleshandblood children the reversing of home and work has got to the point that amerco employees who ca n't handle their family lives can now turn to the company to teach them how , through free workshops on such subjects as dealing with anger ms hochschild s previous book , the second shift , found that in twocareer couples , women still do the lion s share of the child care and housework in the time bind she identifies a third shift , consisting of emotional work at home , which nobody does many of her subjects have invented a potential self who would do all the things they are not doing at home their garages fill up with recreational equipment , bought for the potential self to use , ignored by the real one although ms hochschild s ideal plainly is that men and women would work side by side on all three shifts , she is also unsparing in pointing out that it was women s changing their priorities that produced the net reduction in emotional effort at home everybody knows men have never carried their share of the load of family life , she writes this is n't news the news of this book is that growing numbers of working women are leery of spending more time at home , as well several years ago daniel yankelovich , the psychologist and management consultant , observed that one of the main changes in american culture since the second world war has been the emergence of a tendency to view work as a source of personal satisfaction when mothers entered the work force en masse , it was partly out of economic necessity and partly a manifestation of this alteration of the culture of work reread the feminine mystique and you 'll see that betty friedan made her case for women working with a rhetoric not of justice or power , but selffulfillment \( ms friedan had the temerity to attack sigmund freud back when that took real courage , but she was completely under the sway of abraham maslow and his glorification of people who can ascend to the satisfaction of higherorder needs \) men , less noticeably because they were already working , made roughly the same change at the same time that s why the organization man , with its dutiful drones , has become a period piece ms hochschild ends

st petersburg , russia until it was irreversibly damaged by a vandal in the summer of 1985 , rembrandt s danae was by common consent one of the most beautiful of all european paintings though at first believed to have been damaged beyond any hope of recovery , it is to go back on view in the hermitage here on oct 13 after 12 years of close and often perilous work on its restoration the danae had always engendered a particular affection the story of how zeus came to danae in the form of a shower of gold was a longtime favorite with painters titian , among others but rembrandt gave it a spin all his own his danae was not a greek princess but a beautiful young dutchwoman of rembrandt s own day \( no one ever forgot the gesture with which she threw off the covers to welcome her unexpected but irresistible visitor \) ever since it was bought in 1772 by catherine the great of russia from the crozat collection in paris , the danae had stood out as one of the great treasures of the hermitage but on a saturday afternoon in the summer of 1985 , the danae was attacked by a man who has been variously described as either a deviant , a madman or an embittered citizen of one baltic state or another his identity has never been disclosed he lunged at the painting with a knife thrust in the region of danae s lower belly apparently dissatisfied with the result , he went on to pour what is estimated to have been a liter of sulfuric acid this formed a dark , bubbling , foulsmelling mass that trickled down to the bottom of the frame and from there onto the floor at the time , the museum s director was away in the country , as were many of his staff on weekends , no member of the paintings restoration department was on duty nor was there anyone in the museum who could identify the acid , which was clearly doing great damage as it ate its way down the canvas after an hour , two professors from the institute of technology came over and recommended that the picture be kept upright and , since no pumps or sprays were available , that small amounts of water be poured , thrown or , if necessary , spat on the damaged areas this advice has sometimes been contested , on the grounds that the water may not so much have washed away the acid as caused it to spread in any case , the damage was a terrifying sight it took a year to inspect the canvas , centimeter by centimeter , under a microscope meanwhile , rumors circulated the central committee of the communist party was pressing for results \( the committee advised , in effect , just to paint it over and get it back , museum officials said \) this pressure was resisted the laborious course that was eventually followed was described to two american visitors by the restorer in charge , yevgeny gerasimov , a staff member of the hermitage for 40 years the logic of restoration takes its own course , he said anything could have happened during these last 12 years all work of this sort is immensely difficult and dangerous mr gerasimov said the staff s methods included the use of sturgeon glue melted with honey that had been a traditional remedy for generations at the hermitage , in the heartland of caviar officials also looked abroad in germany , damage of this sort had recently been done to a rembrandt from the museum in kassel , mr gerasimov said , and so they have had a lot of experience we went to munich to see how they had handled the problem , and they were very helpful to us back home , in what was then the soviet union , a fullsize copy of the danae that had been made early in the 19th century was found in an obscure provincial museum this was offered as a loan and gratefully accepted though in many ways more like a neoclassical painting than a rembrandt , the copy served as an invaluable reminder and approximate map of the original and is still in the restoration studio the fundamental question , mr gerasimov said , was how far should the picture be restored \? when was it time to call a halt \? repainting would , in effect , have made a counterfeit rembrandt , mr gerasimov said the restorers instead opted to fill in and retouch making small transitions from one area to another all the damaged areas had to be toned in , or touched in , to make a ground on which damaged areas could , if possible , be restored , he said delicate problems arose what material should be used \? once it was used , would it be hard to take it out , if necessary \? how would it change with age \? finally there was the problem of what to do in areas where none of the original painting survived the restorers carefully worked their way from one inch to the next using their judgment and experience to do something that was not copying but rather suggesting , mr gerasimov said we tried with danae s arm , jewels , hands and pillow we left the original paint as it was , and made a mosaic of the badly damaged areas , partly retouching and partly making new but fundamentally there is no 'reconstruction' and no repainting there are the damaged parts , and there are the undamaged parts we were very , very careful with the original pigments any repainting means dissonance in the resulting painting , some parts are 100 percent rembrandt , some are 50 percent rembrandt , and some had to be redone , mr gerasimov said the left thigh is slightly restored the right arm was 90 percent damaged but is now back to normal the pearls were intact , but the jewels needed work what the visitor sees is not 'the original , ' and we would never put it forward as such but the spirit of rembrandt is intact mr gerasimov said the restorers had had to use their judgment about how far to carry out their work there are always people who want a complete reconstruction , he said but , finally , the work itself dictates how it should be you have to look , think and feel and it will tell you what to do we had to learn when to stop the painting had already undergone alterations centuries ago xrays show extensive and radical pentimenti by rembrandt himself , mr gerasimov said the dimensions , even , were changed so were the right hand and danae s face a visitor to the hermitage studio was dr hubert von sonnenburg , formerly head of a great museum in munich , the alte pinakothek , and now head of the restoration of paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york he said in a recent interview that the hermitage had an ancient and honorable tradition by which all restorers had to learn to paint and to draw at st petersburg s academy of the arts this means , he added , that they are likely to have the special skills needed for the delicate infilling of damaged areas dr von sonnenburg believes that distance is indispensable when a damaged painting is reintroduced if people are allowed to get close to a oncedamaged painting , they will concentrate on the damage , he said that is what they will remember most but if they are kept at a distance of 12 or 15 feet , they can focus on what really matters the overall poetic effect of a great masterpiece that has survived a terrible ordeal that painting may not be what it once was , or how we remember it , but the spirit of the artist will still be there and that is what matters photo saved the restored danae by rembrandt in 1985 , a madman thrust a knife in the region of the lower belly , then splashed sulfuric acid on the canvas , forming a bubbling mass that trickled to the floor \( hermitage museum \)
woodcliff lake the headquarters of bmw of north america sits on a bluff in this welltodo suburb , flanked by apple and peach trees not only does the orchard offer a pleasant view to bmw workers choosing to eat lunch outdoors on warm days , it also provides a significant tax break for the company the property tax bill for the 20acre orchard is just 37352 the owners of houses across chestnut ridge road from the bmw headquarters do n't come out so well at tax time one neighbor who has 12 acres paid 3 , 44694 in taxes another paid 2 , 65118 for threequarters of an acre what makes the difference for bmw is that its orchard qualifies as farmland under a 32yearold new jersey law , the farmland assessment act , that was intended to provide tax breaks to farmers who depend on their land for their livelihood critics say that the law has created hobby farmers who harvest nothing but tax breaks in mendham , in morris county , for example , the owners of a 15acre meadow on horseshoe bend road where 8 beef cattle graze are charged 29540 in property taxes a 31acre woodlot that produces 5 to 6 cords of firewood a year is taxed 61397 meanwhile , neighbors with more modest properties have tax bills over several thousand dollars \( article , page 10 \) but the law s supporters say it has done what it was intended to do preserve open space and farm jobs for another generation they contend that both homeowners and local officials are happy when undeveloped land stays that way , because it represents a more pastoral life and because farmland requires little in the way of municipal services in effect , farmland keeps overall taxes down there has been only one serious attempt in 32 years to rewrite the law to make it more restrictive an effort in 1976 that was easily defeated in fact , since the law s passage , the only major change has been an extension in 1995 of tax breaks to those who board , train and rehabilitate horses still criticism of the law has never died out completely , largely because its definition of farmland is so broad since 1969 the number of acres qualifying as farmland and , therefore , for tax breaks has almost doubled in new jersey which might be news to people who thought they had been seeing housing developments , shopping malls and office parks pop up where they once saw cows and corn the eligible land 12 million acres now represents nearly 25 percent of all land in new jersey and produces less than onetenth of one percent of all property tax revenue in the state every state gives farmers some tax break , but new jersey s law is one of the most liberal in the northeast , according to jane h malme , a fellow at the lincoln institute of land policy , a nonprofit educational organization in boston specializing in the study of taxation of property and land use policy the reason , she said , is the combination of a low threshold to qualify as farmland a farmer with at least five acres needs to sell just 500 in goods a year and the weak penalty if the land is sold to a developer those factors subvert the original intent of the law , some state legislators argue this is like welfare to the wealthy , said assemblywoman shirley k turner , a democrat from ewing they can very well afford to pay their fair share of property taxes the state agriculture secretary , arthur r brown jr , thinks this criticism is unfounded every one of the landowners is not wealthy , he said , adding i consider ourselves lucky new jersey is the most heavily populated state , with the highest land taxes and labor and utility costs and we still have a viable agriculture what about homeowners in towns with a lot of land that qualifies for the lower farm tax \? in general , it appears that they either do not know they are subsidizing their neighbors or do not mind so the acreage does n't generate money , said alden hess , who lives in mendham , where 23 percent of the land satisfies the farm law s requirements it does n't generate kids either he went on , if the law helps keep this area a little more ruralappearing , that s fine how much wood makes a woodland \? to qualify as farmland , a plot must be at least 5 acres and produce agricultural or horticultural goods of 500 a year , plus 5 for each extra acre of farmland and 50 cents for each extra acre of woodland for example , someone who owns six acres of hayfields would have to sell 505 worth of hay to qualify on six acres of woodland , the sales would have to be 50050 \( since 1969 , the amount of woodlands qualifying for the tax has nearly tripled , to 443 , 000 acres \) by comparison , the federal department of agriculture s definition of a farm differs from that of the state law it requires minimum sales of 1 , 000 under this definition , farmland acreage in new jersey fell from 13 million to 850 , 000 acres between 1964 , the year the law was passed , and 1995 in the same period , the number of farms has fallen from 12 , 000 to 9 , 000 , records show land that qualifies as farmland in new jersey receives an assessment that is a tiny fraction of the taxable value of other land in a town this year s farmland assessments range from 936 a acre for the highest grade cropland in bergen , passaic and union counties to 18 an acre for the lowest quality of woodland in cape may , ocean , sussex and warren counties bmw s 20acre orchard with the 373 tax bill is assessed at 18 , 400 the adjacent 21 acres , where its corporate headquarters stands , is assessed at 106 million and taxed at 215 , 000 a spokesman , tom mcgurn , said bmw inherited the orchard when it bought the site and keeps it for esthetic reasons it s nice for our employees to look out on it and it s nice for our neighbors to have it , he said \( the company pays someone to harvest and sell the fruit , using the records for tax purposes \) another corporate farmer , att , owns a 51acre lot in bedminster used for timbering and 253 other acres that produces hay , barley and corn the total tax bill is 1 , 259 the residents of bedminster like to see it as farmland rather than with 50 homes on it , said att s real estate portfolio manager , jack colasurdo

on nights when the knicks move the ball with precision and hit crucial shots , madison square garden is a special place that has not always been the case this season last night , however , it was the place to be patrick ewing s team could do no wrong as it clinched homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs by defeating reggie miller and the indiana pacers , 9789 the knicks , who received a huge gift from toronto last night when the raptors knocked off the hornets in charlotte , can clinch the third spot in the eastern conference tonight by defeating the bulls at the united center that , of course , will not be easy they are 08 there since 1994 , when the arena opened , and chicago will be looking to win its 70th game this season the hawks , who are half a game behind the knicks , have two games remaining tonight at home against philadelphia and tomorrow against the nets at continental arena a knick loss to the bulls and two victories by the hawks would give atlanta the thirdseeded berth one atlanta loss would give the two teams identical records , with the knicks winning the tiebreaker because new york took the season series against atlanta it s still in our hands , said ewing , who scored a teamhigh 26 points and hauled down 14 rebounds we 've got a big game tomorrow and we expect to win regarding clinching homecourt advantage , he said it s all right we wanted the third seed that s our goal lost in the playoff picture was that new york \( 5625 \) got contributions from all its hired guns in the stretch , holding off the pacers after indiana had crept to within 7471 with less than 10 minutes left allan houston and larry johnson connected on consecutive 3pointers in the final four and half minutes , pushing the lead to 9 on each occasion chris childs \( 6 assists and 3 turnovers \) was not overly impressive , but he did make his only field goal when it counted , with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining throw in 18 points and 12 rebounds \( 5 offensive \) from charles oakley and key support off the bench from buck williams and john starks , and you have a very balanced team heading into the postseason , a team that seemed on the brink less than a week ago i think that we should play that way every game out now because we play better that way , childs said the knicks began with a flurry , forging a 3318 lead after one quarter starks capped 12 minutes of crisp ball movement and menacing defense when he knocked down a 3pointer at the buzzer in the period , ewing had 13 points and childs had 5 of new york s 11 assists indiana s record dropped to 3942 how quickly the pacers have fallen two years ago , they took orlando to seven games in the conference finals today , they are about to finish 10th in the conference and sixth in the midwest division coach larry brown is rumored to be going anywhere from boston to los angeles , depending upon your published report of the week but the knicks have their own troubles new york has a monster task at hand tonight at the united center , where it will try to beat the bulls on their home floor for the first time since the 199394 season the knicks' last victory in chicago came in the final regularseason game in chicago stadium , a game in which they blew out the bulls of course , michael jordan was playing baseball that day when the time comes for us to play chicago , we 're not going to be thinking about not ever having won at the united center , coach jeff van gundy said players do n't think like that they have too much confidence in themselves this team has played in the united center a total of one time this is a different team this team has n't lost however many in a row we 've lost once this year there , by 1 point the score in the bulls' 8887 victory in early january was misleading because the knicks had to battle back from a doublefigure deficit in the final two quarters van gundy said we want to win tomorrow , obviously you 're playing a game and going for a higher seed as far as carryover effect , it has absolutely none i'm convinced that it does n't matter whether you 're playing well at the end of the year or badly going into the playoffs rebounds the knicks finished 3110 at the garden this season , the most victories at home since the 199394 season included in that mark was a 15game winning streak between dec 7 and jan 28 jeff van gundy is not lamenting a single possession or game if his team does not secure the no 3 playoff spot we can point to 25 games , to tell you the truth , he said the knicks are 10 when one of their players sings the national anthem the rookie walter mccarty did the honors before the game a crooner of some renown who once sang the national anthem before a kentuckyindiana game in college , mccarty s teammates walked out to midcourt and hugged and highfived him as he finished he also played for only the third time in the past 11 games , scoring 2 points and grabbing a rebound in six firsthalf minutes i thought he played well , van gundy said he sang well , too it was n't one of those dragged out ones photos patrick ewing , going up for a shot against the pacers , finished with 26 points

there is no escaping incest , not in life or in literature and since anything that can be done must be written about , here are three excerpts from 20thcentury incest narratives i went up to my room , took off my beautiful white satin dress , and unfastened the three pink carnations which had been pinned to my breast by the jews' harp sleep had almost come to me the room was dark the house silent then , creaking stealthily , the door opened treading gingerly , someone entered 'who \? ' i cried 'do n't be frightened , ' george whispered 'and do n't turn on the light , oh beloved beloved ' and he flung himself on my bed , and took me in his arms yes , the old ladies of kensington and belgravia never knew that george duckworth was not only father and mother , brother and sister to those poor stephen girls he was their lover also virginia woolf , 22 hyde park gate , written about 1921 from moments of being \( harcourt brace jovanovich , 1976 \) this woolf memoir went unpublished for more than 50 years , and reaches us from the safest distance it describes events that took place in another country nearly a century ago and besides , the writer s dead i play with the bits of thread of my jumper it is n't to change anything , nothing can be changed i try to make it into o s and a s , to tell me my future except that i have none it s 7 o'clock on a bright summer s evening , the sun , the glorious sun showing up the dirt on all the window panes and my father gone to bed early , drugged himself with tablets because of his loneliness and trying , i think , trying i think , not to harm me but the harm is done edna o'brien , down by the river \( farrar , straus giroux , 1997 \) this is from ms o'brien s current novel , and a harrowing novel it is , full of cruelty and mourning and every kind of lust \( sexual , ideological , religious \) gone wrong a true story set it in motion the 1992 case of a 14yearold girl in ireland who tried to get an abortion on the ground of incest but more than the names have been changed down by the river is a fullbodied , fully imagined novel , which means that it makes the facts of life not just bearable but redeemable every day the sun rises and sinks over the grand canyon , each time filling it with shadows the color of blood after months of letters and calls , as many as three of each in a day , all promising devotion , all asking for mine , my father has prepared me for what he requests 'i'm not sure i want to , ' i say 'i do n't think i can' my teeth chatter in the warm car it s dusk when he finally says it the canyon is dark the canyon is a river of blood , because when my father says the words i 've dreaded 'make love' is the expression he uses god s heart bursts , it breaks for me it does 'i love you , ' my father says 'i need you' 'i need you , too , ' i whisper please do n't make this the price , i beg silently 'what are you afraid of \? ' he asks i'm afraid that whatever he wants , i will give him it s only a matter of time kathryn harrison , the kiss \( random house , 1997 \) and with this passage from ms harrison s memoir , we enter a vehement , even hysterical debate about the literary , social and psychological propriety of publishing such stories there has been media condemnation \( how could ms harrison do this when her father is still alive and when she has children of her own \? \) there has been media congratulation \( o valiant woman and artist , to offer up your pain and privacy on the altars of truth and art \) there have been spiteful asides to the effect that since there are facts missing and ms harrison wrote about incest in her novels , she probably called this book a memoir to get herself publicity and a best seller and , of course , there has been general cultural handwringing and lamentation \( what are literature and civilized discourse coming to \? where is taste \? where is discretion \? \) this leads us to what is now officially called the memoir backlash , in which the fact that so many writers are producing memoirs instead of novels becomes the mark of our culture s decline into mass narcissism and exhibitionism leaving aside all those narcissistic , exhibitionist novels , poems and plays that have tainted our days and burdened our nights through the years , it is true that the memoir is a very tricky form tricky and treacherous , like all confessions it plays fast and loose with every kind of truth true facts versus true imaginings , for instance and it never stops questioning the nature and purpose of lies in a way , the memoir makes us more complicitous than the novel it unearths our own prejudices and vulnerabilities more quickly and allows us no escape from them a memoir reader is like william burroughs s innocent bystander there is no such thing , mr burroughs sneers , because what was he doing there in the first place \? but for all that , a good memoir does what a good novel does it gives form and rhythm , visual and tonal order to our lives , as we live them and as we dream them
manhattan , kan , march 23 the nation s latest literary sensation is used to spending days watching soap operas , napping in the afternoon and fashioning lacy bookmarks for each new member of her church she has lived a simple , homespun life rearing eight children and , before retirement , working in a laundry and as a nurse s aide but nothing has been simple since word got around publishing circles two weeks ago about the memoir that jessie lee brown foveaux wrote at age 80 , describing the quietly heroic struggles of a woman to win her independence while in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic a barrage of phone calls has come from publishers , agents and television producers family members , for whom mrs foveaux \( pronounced fohvoh \) originally wrote her memories in longhand nearly 20 years ago , have gathered from as far as georgia and minnesota television crews invaded her tiny , immaculately kept house , where there is a 1977 jimmy carter calendar on the wall on thursday she learned that after a frenzied book auction 1 , 500 miles away in another manhattan , warner books had bought her 208page memoir , the life of jessie lee brown from birth up to 80 , for more than 1 million and last week the mayor of manhattan , a town of 60 , 000 on the broken brown prairie along the kansas river , proclaimed a day in mrs foveaux s honor it was too overwhelming for the snowyhaired author , a greatgreatgrandmother who last week turned 98 a party for her scheduled for today had to be canceled when she was hospitalized with exhaustion and a sinus infection on friday a new digital hearing aid , her one indulgence since becoming a celebrity , may have been partly to blame it amplified sounds so intensely that even a mouse inside the walls could be heard , and gave her a headache when you 're used to sitting quietly and making doilies , it s all too much , said joan foveaux , the wife of one of mrs foveaux s 14 grandchildren mrs foveaux s rather stunned emergence into the literary spotlight offers a striking lesson in how publishing works at a time when commercial success is so closely tied to attention in the news media publishers who took part in the auction said the high price paid the unknown author was in part a result of the recent success of other memoirs by older people , like having our say the delany sisters' first 100 years but they said the real coin of the realm was the builtin publicity that mrs foveaux s book arrives with her life story first came to light in a frontpage article in the wall street journal on march 7 , which imbued her kansas struggles with a mythic quality had her manuscript arrived unsolicited at major publishing houses , it almost surely would have been ignored but the national attention conferred by the newspaper set off frantic efforts to buy the book , even before publishers had read a full paragraph the frenzied tone was echoed by sue carswell , a senior editor at simon schuster s pocket books , who predicted in a second wall street journal article on march 14 that the auction would be the biggest day in publishing this year adding fuel to the fire , word spread that 60 minutes planned a story about mrs foveaux timed to publication day in the fall , one of the greatest marketing sendoffs a book can have it s absolute gold , said an agent who competed unsuccessfully to represent the book and spoke on condition of anonymity it sets off all the commercial bells carolyn reidy , the president and publisher of simon schuster s trade division , said this is not about the insight of the book it s about how we try to sell them if she did n't have this flush of publicity , i doubt it would have gotten past an editor none of these doings in elite manhattan media circles mean much to the residents of hardworking manhattan , kan , an agricultural center and home of kansas state university about two hours west of kansas city on saturday , after recuperating for a night at memorial hospital , mrs foveaux was helped back into the singlestory house on thurston street where she has lived 74 years i feel much stronger than i did yesterday , she said the phone was ringing from 8 o'clock on the 7th until i left the house it was getting on my nerves her fingernails were freshly manicured and her skin had a translucent glow despite her frailness , she shows a remarkable independence of spirit her three surviving children have pleaded with her to move in with them , especially after she broke a hip two years ago , but mrs foveaux insists on living on her own she makes her bed each morning , then puts a kettle on for oatmeal she has refused to let family members buy her a dishwasher or a clothes dryer family members scoffed at the possibility that she might move to a bigger house she would n't move if we bought her six of them , said her son marion foveaux , 62 , a retired crane operator who looks in on her two or three times a day mrs foveaux said she would donate some money to the first baptist church and to home care and hospice groups she could think of almost nothing she wanted for herself
lagrange , ny caren and dan mahar thought about sending their 5yearold daughter , katie , to school once a week this fall , but decided against it it would have meant her having to wear a sleeping bag over her head while she was being transported and finding a windowless room where she could play and learn a rare genetic disease , xeroderma pigmentosum , has made katie a prisoner of the dark the sun , even the slightest bit , is her enemy , causing severe burns , blistering and , almost inevitably , skin cancer basically , the school nurse , principal and special education teacher kept saying , 'it all depends on how much risk you 're willing to take , ' mrs mahar recalled i thought about it , and i'm not willing to take any risk we 've kept this child in the house for two and a half years being with other children is important , but not worth risking her health so for the foreseeable future , katie will get her lessons via video telephone at home , a yellow colonial with black shutters on a rural lane here in this suburb of poughkeepsie the special phone is just one of many steps katie and her parents have taken to help her cope with xeroderma pigmentosum , or xp while some families can be destroyed by the extraordinary demands of such a condition , others , like the mahars , respond in ways that benefit their own child and the handful of others similarly afflicted , helping to mold them into a community the mahars have started a summer camp where children play at night and sleep in the day they began a support group , now with 2 , 000 members worldwide and in a thoroughly modern response , they established a home page on the world wide web \( http www1 mhv net xps \) full of research , the history of the disease and the camp schedule patients with the disease have a defect in their dna repair mechanism that leaves them unable to mend damage caused by ultraviolet rays both of katie s parents carried the recessive gene for the disease sufferers are 1 , 000 times more likely to develop skin cancer than nonsufferers , said dr kenneth kraemer , a research dermatologist at the national cancer institute patients are also likely to get growths , cancerous and noncancerous , on their eyes about 20 to 30 percent of patients degenerate neurologically , suffering mental retardation and losing the ability to hear , talk and walk those not protected starting in early childhood usually do not live past their teens or 20 s in many ways , katie , a smart , spirited child with a fullmoon face and big brown eyes , looks like any other 5yearold she fights with her older siblings , teresa , danny and brendan she counts past 30 she treats her bed like a trampoline right now , she is trying to figure out where she fits in her universe her mother says she asks , how come i have xp , and you do n't and daddy does n't and brendan , teresa and danny do n't \? she wants to know if her goldfish have xp since they do not go out either i tell her no , but maybe santa claus does , maybe the tooth fairy does , mrs mahar said they only go out at night i 've also told her everybody has something that somebody else does n't have it just makes them special of course , she did n't buy that for a minute protecting katie from ultraviolet rays takes thought and effort even though she remains indoors , she is covered head to toe with sunscreen in the morning in the afternoon , more sunscreen in the summer , she is slathered with sunscreen six to eight times a day the car windows are tinted the house windows are also tinted , and shaded with blinds and curtains the family put garbage bags on the windows until a glasstinting professional donated the tinted windows the doors and windows are always locked , so no one accidentally exposes katie to sunlight her pediatrician visits her at home though she goes out at night , she is usually restricted to the backyard , where she swings or plays ball with her family incandescent light bulbs do not affect her , but she is sensitive to halogen headlights so she wears sunglasses when riding in the car she is also sensitive to unshielded fluorescent lights , found in many stores and fastfood restaurants the mahars use light meters , also donated , to determine the power of ultraviolet rays in indoor places the other day , she asked me , 'why do n't you take me to lunch at mcdonald s \?

the way in which future elections are conducted , mr tung and the chinese are , as they have said , deliberately trying to undermine hong kong s political parties , particularly the democrats while half of hong kong s people remain worried about their personal freedom after july 1 , according to a poll conducted before the new rules were announced , sentiment toward china has shifted as well , with a mix of enthusiasm and resignation to chinese sovereignty beginning to reshape attitudes still , in the eight years since the killing of hundreds of people in beijing by the chinese army , hong kong has grown from a politically somnambulent society into one in which issues are vigorously debated and elections conducted with relish the political culture of hong kong is changing , said peter t y cheung , a professor of politics at the university of hong kong sometimes too much attention is paid to what the chinese government is saying what is important is the domestic sources of change the democratic party is inevitably part of this we will have to see in fact whether hong kong people become more conservative but i do think , over time , more and more people will tend to be more conservative colonial legacy from britain fades indeed , hong kong s enthusiasm for politics is of very recent vintage for most of the last century and a half , british colonial rule , paternalistic and patronizing , discouraged domestic political activity and prohibited it altogether in the case of communist activism british governors oversaw the territory and administered it with regiments of british civil servants , who decided on what was best for hong kong with scarcely a concern for what the hong kong people thought but with britain s agreement in 1984 to return hong kong to china , followed by waves of repression in china culminating in the mass killing of protesters in beijing in 1989 , many people here who were determined to have some say in their future began organizing pressure groups and political parties the first steps toward selfdetermination were tentative 10 years ago , even the most vocal politicians in the new democratic party were calling for neither universal suffrage nor an elected head of government the democrats in the beginning were quite modest , said anthony b l cheung , a democratic party legislator in 1988 , when we were formed , we only asked for half the seats on the legislative council to be elected and we even lost on that point but by 1995 , when for the first time hong kong s legislature was to be wholly elected in a combination of direct and indirect voting , the democratic party had come into its own and , together with its allies , commanded 29 of 60 seats outright beijing , which had refused to countenance elections at all , denounced the voting as a ploy by hong kong s british governor , chris patten , to undermine the transition to chinese rule and a threat to political and economic stability politics , in short , became something of a dirty word , so much so that mr tung , beijing s appointee , repeatedly tells audiences that one of the greatest dangers facing hong kong is that it has become too politicized mr tung declined requests to be interviewed the head of the party is defiant and worried martin lee chuming , the democratic party s leader , was running late , and the day had just begun crisp in a charcoal pinstriped suit and a white shirt , mr lee bolted from the taxi and swept into a room of lights and television cameras there was one of his most prominent opponents , tsang yok sing , the leader of a probeijing political party sorry i'm late , mr lee muttered then , for the next 45 minutes , he answered questions from a canadian television reporter and parried mr tsang s robust defense of china s approach to hong kong but what angered mr lee most was mr tsang s defense of beijing s provisional legislature for hong kong , a body to which mr tsang was appointed after being resoundingly defeated in the 1995 elections i was elected by the people of hong kong , and you were not , an indignant mr lee said since its formal christening in 1991 , the democratic party has been led by mr lee , a leading barristers
from crowded shopping boulevards to a parade route in the bronx and a public swimming pool in queens , three democratic mayoral candidates competed for the attention of new yorkers at play yesterday by assailing mayor rudolph w giuliani and , to a lesser extent , squabbling among themselves ruth w messinger , smiling and waving as she carried her 1yearold granddaughter , amani , marched in the afroamerican caribbean day parade on the grand concourse in the bronx sal f albanese , wearing a white shirt and necktie , shook hands at the deepdale pool club in little neck , queens and the rev al sharpton told supporters in harlem that the race was settling on the issues he had flagged from the start police abuses and endemic unemployment all three candidates , talking to whatever constituents they could find on a crisp and sunny saturday , continued to attack the mayor over what prosecutors say was an attack on a haitian immigrant , abner louima , by police officers at the 70th precinct station house in brooklyn these people engaged in depraved behavior and they should be locked up , said mr albanese , a city councilman from brooklyn he blamed lax police hiring practices too many cops wind up as ticking time bombs , he said ms messinger called for tougher penalties for officers who give false testimony in investigations of wrongdoing it might have sent a message to officers in the sevenoh and other officers around the city who were beginning to think that you could get away with actions like this , ms messinger , the manhattan borough president , said mr sharpton , participating in a loud and festive rally at the offices of the national action network , a nonprofit political group he heads , referred repeatedly to the attack at the 70th precinct his focus reflects his calculation that the louima case will produce a surge of interest in the primary among black voters , presumably to his benefit why did that policeman say that , 'it s giuliani time \? ' mr sharpton said , recounting mr louima s account of what an officer said during the attack mr sharpton s question drew shouts from the crowd talk about it ! talk about it ! he knows he s in trouble , mr sharpton said of the mayor he can run but he ca n't hide both mr sharpton and ms messinger kept the focus on the mayor but mr albanese , who has recently complained about difficulty in winning attention , turned his attention on ms messinger mr albanese called a reporter yesterday morning to take issue with the way ms messinger described her credentials in the voter guide issued by the campaign finance board in it , ms messinger listed herself as a teacher , because , her aides later said , she taught for two years at the children s community workshop school , an alternative school that operated from 1968 to 1974 and was founded by parents mr albanese , who taught in new york public schools , said that that did not qualify her as a teacher albanese charges she s distorting her own occupation ! mr albanese said , referring to himself in the third person are you going to call her on it \? she s not a teacher ms messinger s spokesman , leland t jones , said it s a false charge there is no fire there is no smoke , except the smoke that sal is blowing the primary is now just over two weeks away sept 9 though none of the candidates encountered overwhelming interest about the contest yesterday and while mr sharpton and mr albanese bounced from event to event , ms messinger , who is widely viewed as the frontrunner , kept to a more leisurely schedule after attending the parade , she visited the bronx borough president , fernando ferrer , at albert einstein hospital , where he was recovering from minor surgery , before calling it a day i'm going to have my hair washed , she said
adix , one of the most majestic of the world s elite group of superyachts , set sail this weekend in a quest greater than winning but to be successful , adix needs wind , and lots of it the 183foot , threemasted schooner is one of 15 sailing vessels that pulled away from the docks yesterday morning at chelsea piers , near 23d street along the hudson river the fleet set sail on a route south to sandy hook , nj , for the 2 pm start of the atlantic challenge cup winds were brisk a good sign at about 15 knots from the southwest the competition is a 3 , 000mile race to the lizard , a spit of land off the southwest coast of england the boat with perhaps the best chance of beating a historic 92yearold transatlantic record is adix of the challenge fleet , the schooner looks and performs the most like the yacht atlantic , the 184foot vessel whose 1905 record of 12 days 4 hours is the standard these sailors consider their benchmark the 26member adix crew has embraced the dream before in 1993 , it went after atlantic s record and failed it s a personal thing for us because adix is so much like the yacht atlantic , said paul goss , the 46yearold skipper of adix we have the same overall length , displacement and sail plan a lot of it is coincidental although adix was built with the yacht atlantic in mind goss said that four years ago , adix was a full day ahead of the 1905 record until a full breeze dwindled to a wisp the crew completed the trip under engine but it was the aborted record attempt that prompted the new york yacht club to stage the atlantic challenge competition this weekend the challenge cup event has been planned for more than a year , and organizers have meticulously followed the traditions of atlantic s recordbreaking voyage when atlantic left sandy hook nearly a century ago , the yacht was competing against 10 vessels in a race adix and the other 85to170foot yachts are sailing in a competitive fleet \( the other woman , an 192foot yacht that was to be the biggest in the fleet , was forced to cancel its entry because of an engine fire last week \) also , the race s starting line yesterday was set in the same place as the 1905 race at a site two miles off sandy hook where a lightship had once been anchored atlantic s 12day time for the crossing has held up through most of the last century a few modern racing yachts have been able to beat the time by a day or so by waiting for a strong breeze in the challenge cup , an arranged starting time sets the pace by sailing in a competition , none of the superyachts have the luxury of waiting for a weather window to show ideal conditions although adix has the potential for a recordbreaking passage , ice could get in the way bob rice , a weather forecaster from wolfeboro , nh , said last week that icebergs have been seen in an area onethird of the way along the race route icebergs tend to be found in clusters , rice said but there s a lot of ocean out there i know a lot of people who never see them but you ca n't count on it adix is owned by a spanish banker who declines to be identified but the man s enchantment with atlantic s record is clear in 1991 , he arranged for the 15 million adix , constructed in 1984 , to be completely rebuilt it is outfitted with modern navigational tools and a keel design not available to the yacht atlantic , which fell into disrepair and sank more than a decade ago goss expects adix s closest rival to be adela , a 170foot yacht that he says is likely to perform better than adix in a light breeze but if that weather happens , neither yacht can expect to break atlantic s record race officials have set an arbitrary way point for the race fleet at 42 degrees north latitude , which means competing vessels are not allowed to sail north of that latitude yachts could be tempted to sail into the iceberginfested waters because they mark part of the great circle route , the shortest distance to england most of the icebergs are at 45 degrees north latitude , rice said \( new york city is at 40 degrees north latitude \) while the ice is a concern , goss said that adix has some experience with icebergs , having recently sailed to antarctica down there , it does n't really get dark in the summer , so you have good visibility , he said it s different north of new york , where we will have periods of dark but safety in this race is paramount , and if we do see ice , it will apt to be more like bergy bits supporting the new york york yacht club in the event is the royal cornwall yacht club of england , and corporate sponsors such as rolex watch photo the schooner adix leaving the chelsea piers yesterday on its way to the start of the american challenge cup \( monica almeida the new york times \)
the decision by jujamcyn theaters and the pace theatrical group to form a partnership in the creation , production and , in a sense , distribution of broadway shows is not only one of the most significant developments to occur in the industry in recent years , it also signals a change in the way broadway makes theater the revolution is in the growing number of entertainment companies that are seeking to create vertical theatrical empires , financing and supervising the production of multimilliondollar plays and musicals from start to finish , running them in their own theaters and even taking them on the road leading the way were the walt disney company \( producers of beauty and the beast and the impending lion king \) and garth drabinsky s torontobased livent inc \( show boat and , this december , ragtime \) the two companies create their own musicals , and have refurbished or are building at enormous expense vast theaters on a resuscitated 42d street this gives both enterprises tremendous leverage in a business in which real estate is to a large degree destiny , as the shubert organization , operators of 17 of the 32 commercial broadway theaters , has proved for years undoubtedly , the formal relationship between pace and jujamcyn will increase the volume of large commercial musicals available to broadway , and may even attract other corporate investors but corporate giants do n't always manufacture theatrical gems and because theater space and the audience for broadway shows is finite , and the progress of earning back an initial investment in most shows is agonizingly slow , it is unclear how much more product broadway can support the agreement may also be a boon to rival landlords on broadway , always on the lookout for lucrative longterm tenants \( although broadway types are highly competitive , they are also forced to be cooperative in the past , for instance , rocco landesman , president of jujamcyn , has invested in and produced shows with his bigger rival , the shuberts disney s and livent s entries have helped reinvigorate broadway at a time when rising costs and dwindling audiences for nontouristoriented shows have sent independent stage producers the momandpop entrepreneurs who have traditionally raised money for shows from slews of small investors into retreat now , as reported yesterday , jujamcyn , with five broadway houses the smallest of the big three theater owners on broadway , appears to have embraced the disneylivent model by teaming up with pace , an increasingly powerful and visible company on both broadway and the road pace , which produced the hit the who s tommy , had jekyll and hyde and david copperfield s dreams and nightmares on broadway this season the agreement also reflects a jockeying for position among those who count themselves the next generation of broadway leaders , theater executives like mr landesman and michael david , a principal in the influential dodger productions gerald schoenfeld and james nederlander sr , the chief executives of the two largest theater chains on broadway , the shubert and nederlander organizations , have been the dominant players in the business for more than two decades they are in their 70 s now , and their successors have not been made apparent in another way , the pacejujamcyn partnership is reminiscent of the kind of empirebuilding that the shubert brothers sam , lee and j j engaged in during the early part of the century , when they established a vast circuit of theaters in new york and around the country their dominance was so complete that by 1927 they owned 104 theaters and booked shows into 1 , 000 more but the shuberts ran into legal problems in 1950 , the federal government filed an antitrust action against them , charging that the shuberts monopolized the industry as a result , the brothers agreed to divest 12 of their theaters and get out of the booking business today , the shubert foundation , the philanthropic body that oversees the properties , owns or operates just 21 theaters pace and jujamcyn are nowhere near as powerful as the shuberts once were their interests outside new york are mainly as tour producers , not theater owners their common interest is in strengthening their position in the face of increased competition from the likes of disney but even if the new players and alliances are one more sign of a more corporate approach to the creation of theatrical art broadway has even acquired its first national sponsor , with the naming of continental airlines as its official carrier the strategy is by no means foolproof for one thing , theater remains a very precarious investment , as demonstrated by the recent closing , in the red , of andrew lloyd webber s lavish and , one might have presumed , surefire commercial property , sunset boulevard and even more important , no one in any boardroom is likely to write the next hit play or musical it is n't at all clear , say many who work on broadway , where skepticism is as indigenous as gossip , that producers can buy their way to success one of broadway s most tenacious problems has been finding and nurturing the outsize talents , the next great writers and composers , who might lead the theater back into the mainstream of american culture
it was sometime in the early 1970 s that a black parent , listening to her daughter chat on the telephone with a friend , remarked your black voice is too crude you sound like a white rockandroller why do they sing as if all negroes came from the same part of mississippi \? such a remark could have been devastating and was certainly embarrassing but the daughter , who was then in her 20 s , decided she had better try to make it culturally useful the mother , whose everyday speech was standardized , but who also had a goodly amount of black english at her command for recreational and theatrical purposes , went on to demonstrate several black voices , each a mixture of accent , diction , expressions and constructions affected by region , class , profession , social life and verbal resourcefulness among the things that black and standardized english have in common is that each can be spoken well , badly or indifferently and part of the confusion over the status and use of black english has to do with just this confusion between speaking it well and speaking it badly that s not black english , that s bad english , aficionados will tell you in a minute when black vernacular first swept american popular culture , north and south , via the 19thcentury minstrel show , it was pleasing and comforting to treat it as a comic set of malapropisms and syntactical mishaps joined to other kinds of slang and grammar mocklatin constructions , british archaisms , theater lingo and every immigrant group s struggles and experiments with the language it was meant to convey cheerful , wanton ignorance and hilariously inept delusions of grandeur a sample , from an 1874 minstrel play , a sendup of othello entitled desdemonum an ethiopian burlesque in three scenes oteller wake desdemonum , see de risin' moon , ebrybody s snorin' , nightingale s in tune desdemonum 'tel , my duck , i hear you daddy s gone to bed fotch along your ladderum , i'm de gal to wed ! both de hour am propitious come , my darlin' flame ! dey say dat in de dark all cullers am de same here are jaunty ignorance and aspirations quite above one s station , along with moments of homespun melancholy this is why the black writer and scholar james weldon johnson remarked with a certain weariness in 1922 that negro dialect had become an instrument with just two full stops humor and pathos which turned out not to be the case , or rather , turned out not to be the entire case by any means all sorts of people and influences got to work writers , linguists and anthropologists , blues , gospel and jazz musicians and not just the singers , the instrumentalists , too , for black vernacular is all bound up with rhythm , melody and the ties between speech , song and pure sound and , of course , the popular songwriters and performers \( vaudevillians , thespians , movie stars \) of various and sundry races joined literary language to the spoken word and made people sing , dance and dream in both all those phrasings and expressions finding their way up from various underworlds and subcultures the brawls and debates over black english its place in the culture , its influence , its origins were already under way by the 1920 s i wish it were surprising that white scholars were inclined to emphasize the british and european ancestry of black english , while black scholars looked to its links with west african languages as it turns out , both were right it is the exclusion of one or the other influence that makes for bad scholarship the wellresearched , dispassionate acknowledgment of each is a matter of intellectual responsibility , not multicultural preening having been told once upon a time that my black english was not as fluid or versatile an instrument as i had hoped , i became extremely interested in its qualities and varieties it has a fraught history , and it arouses every kind of mixed motive and feeling in those who speak , imitate , sample , read or hear it a few illustrations , using classics of american popular culture you could start with those dialect popjazz songs that bing crosby recorded with paul whiteman and the rhythm boys in the 1920 s , numbers like mississippi mud , the rhythm kings and tai n't so honey , tai n't so you can hear the pleasure crosby and the boys take in the musical resources of this language you can hear him learning from it and you can hear the skill and charm \( yes , charm do not underestimate young mr crosby \) with which he does so you can hear the smugness , too \( not all the time but more than enough of the time \) it s the vocal equivalent of a smirk , a wink and an arched eyebrow , letting the audience know that he and they are above all this and just fooling around crosby continued to dip in and out of dialect for the rest of his life in a droll jekyllandhyde sort of way sometimes white english was hyde and black english jekyll sometimes it was the other way around it is just this duality , this ambivalence that makes the descendants of white minstrelsy , from crosby to presley to mick jagger , so interesting when it comes to black illustrations , it would be all too easy to say what about virtually every word louis armstrong ever spoke or inflected \?

washington , aug 8 back when she was a municipal judge in ohio , draped in bland but comforting black robes and following a daily timetable more or less of her own design , deborah pryce thought life on capitol hill must be all chandeliers and limousines i just know that when i was just a regular normal american , i thought everybody elected to those positions had a little bit more of a glamorous life , she recalls now ms pryce pictured a staff so large that aides dashed out at a moment s notice simply to fetch dry cleaning evenings , she imagined , were spent brainstorming with the political intelligentsia , thinking up big , bold ideas and best of all , she believed , days spent in the halls of congress were scheduled with clockwork regularity she was , by her own account , totally a child in the dark in 1993 , judge pryce became congresswoman pryce voters had catapulted her from a columbus courthouse to capitol hill on her moderate republican convictions and a reformist platform of do more with less , and she soon discovered how prophetic a goal that would prove to be from a personal standpoint and just how exhausting for the most part , her days now are filled with the persistent demands of constituents , colleagues , staff , the party , the news media and her family back home in columbus there are few minutes that are not promised to someone or something , and then shuffled and reshuffled as the day is jostled by committee chairmen , party leaders and fundraising commitments ms pryce does not ride in limousines there is nothing luxurious about her intown digs ,

chicago , may 13 george steinbrenner , the owner of the yankees who is suing every other team and every highlevel official in major league baseball , suffered a doublebarreled blow today the ruling executive council , calling the lawsuit a blatant violation of the major league agreement , suspended him indefinitely as a member at the same time , the law firm representing steinbrenner in the suit decided it will no longer represent him because of a potential conflict of interest the dual development could conceivably prompt steinbrenner to consider a settlement of the suit the council also stripped the yankees of membership on all committees on which the owner or any other official serves steinbrenner , for example , is a member of the realignment committee , which is discussing possible shuffling of some teams between the national and american leagues this is sad , and it s too bad , said bud selig , chairman of the council , which rules baseball in the absence of a commissioner steinbrenner was one of 10 members of the body , which includes four owners from each league and the two league presidents the council , selig said , did not discuss the possibility of suspending steinbrenner from baseball at this point , given where we are and given what s happened so far , we believe that is the appropriate action at this point in time , selig said in response to a question about a general suspension he emphasized the phrase at this point in time in new york , meanwhile , cravath , swaine moore decided it would withdraw from its representation of steinbrenner in the lawsuit it filed a week ago in federal district court in tampa , fla samuel butler , cravath s managing partner , said details remained to be worked out , but he said , there s no question we 'll not continue to represent mr steinbrenner in the matter asked what details had to be worked out , butler said by telephone , we have to make sure mr steinbrenner will have counsel satisfactory to him butler did n't explain the firm s decision , but it had a potential conflict in representing steinbrenner because cravath has long represented time warner , parent company of the atlanta braves , one of 46 defendants in the suit steinbrenner , joined by adidas , with which the yankees have a 95 million agreement , is suing on antitrust grounds , challenging the agreement that governs baseball s licensing and sponsorship business selig announced the suspension after a fourhour meeting at the o'hare hilton the nine members of the council present discussed the matter for about an hour , one of them said , and selig added that the vote to suspend was very unanimous steinbrenner , he said , had not been invited to attend obviously , selig said , when you 're discussing a matter like that , i would think recusal is logical i do n't think anyone would debate that last friday , steinbrenner , who during his 25year ownership of the yankees has incurred two lengthy suspensions from baseball , said he had offered to recuse himself from any council discussion about the lawsuit but that gesture was not enough for the council i think the council felt the action it took today was the appropriate action , selig said howard rubenstein , a spokesman for the yankees , issued a onesentence statement following the council s action the lawyers for the new york yankees and adidas are studying these actions and reserve all comment for now , he said although the suit was filed a week ago , none of the defendants has been served with it steinbrenner s lawyers have 60 days in which to take that step the fact that no one had been served led to speculation that settlement discussions could ensue , but selig said none had taken place the council acted on the basis of the provision in the major league agreement , which all owners sign , that prohibits clubs from suing the commissioner the council serves as commissioner when the office is vacant , which it has been since the owners ousted fay vincent in september , 1992 clubs , however , have sued commissioners and not been disciplined the most recent to do so was the tribune company , owner of the chicago cubs , which sued vincent earlier in 1992 over his realignment of the divisions in the national league the tribune company was not a member of the executive council at the time david boies , the cravath lawyer who has represented steinbrenner , took the position last week that the nonsue provision did not apply in this case because there is no commissioner and the council is not a neutral party , which the commissioner would be if a club chose to take a dispute to him selig , who owns the milwaukee brewers and also serves as the acting commissioner , saw the lawsuit as a negative development for baseball we 've been through a lot , he said all of us understand the need to focus this game back on the field it is very , very important people are tired of hearing about owners and acting commissioners and heads of the union and so forth anything that detracts from that is quite frankly a matter to me of very deep concern i think the fan has been subjected to enough of this and frankly this is just a source of great concern inside pitch bud selig said the council had initiated the process by which the los angeles dodgers could be sold to the fox television group , a subsidiary of rupert murdoch s news corporation he confirmed that the dodgers have requested permission to turn over financial data for fox to study we have ownership guidelines , selig said the action we took today follows those guidelines we have some things to gather the process has begun the process is complicated , meaning there will be no swift sale to fox but there also is no reason to believe it wo n't take place
baltimore , aug 28 davey johnson is yelling his voice is cresting his head bobs with every other syllable , as he explains why the orioles are more cohesive this year , why they are playing so well johnson is angry the orioles , who play the mets in a threegame series here that starts friday , have the best record in baseball at 8446 johnson has the highest career winning percentage of any active manager in the majors \( 578 \) there does not seem to be any reason for him to be annoyed , but he is we had a good year last year we 're having a good year this year , johnson said , his eyes hidden behind sunglasses i get mad when i get asked questions about it every question , he feels , carries implications every answer promises complications johnson is under pressure to win more than just an american league east title the tension between johnson and the orioles' owner , peter angelos , is no secret , and there has been speculation that johnson will be fired if the team does not win the world series some in the organization believe it is probably more important for johnson that the team advances in the postseason beyond the yankees johnson said recently , in general terms , that he puts pressure on himself to win a world series no matter what the situation or who the competition might be , adding a line which had orioles fans twittering i got a threeyear deal , but i felt we 've got to do it in two johnson insisted the statement was presented out of context , but angelos said in an interview wednesday night i did n't think there was any basis at all for him to make that statement , and still do n't no one is expected or commanded to win a world series that s ridiculous asked to assess johnson s strengths , angelos said he s winning , and when you 're winning as resoundingly as this team has in 1997 , you 'd have to say he s done an excellent job his weaknesses \? i thought there were some shaky episodes last year , angelos said , but this year it s been much better johnson wins everywhere he goes , and everywhere he goes , johnson knocks heads with those he works for when he managed the mets from 198490 , club officials wanted him to exert more control over players who were winning 100 games a year \( if we won 108 games , johnson said , they wanted us to win 130 \) when he managed the cincinnati reds from 199395 , the owner , marge schott , did not like him , even though he and the general manager , jim bowden , built the team into a championshipcaliber club davey has a strong personality , angelos said , which he downplays by being very affable he s very pleasant and very personable , with a soft exterior , but he s got strong opinions and he s very willful and wants to get it done the way he thinks it s done best none of that is wrong , but that kind of personality generates friction angelos hired johnson after the 1995 season , two weeks after firing phil regan as manager johnson came to baltimore with the proper pedigree , having played under earl weaver , the legendary orioles manager , and having managed the mets to a world series title in 1986 orioles fans fill camden yards every day , offer applause generously and boo sparingly angelos is committed to spending the money required to compete with the yankees but managing the orioles presents unique circumstances johnson s boss , angelos , and the most important player in johnson s clubhouse , cal ripken , are both extraordinarily competitive and stubborn angelos is a selfmade plaintiff lawyer who has won billions of dollars in settlements ripken has not missed a game since 1982 , and past managers have acknowledged the future of his streak does not lie in their hands , but in those of ripken johnson s challenge is to find a way to exist between these two giant personalities the transition has not been smooth the orioles earned a wildcard berth in 1996 , making the playoffs for the first time since 1983 , but there were tempests throughout the season and beyond johnson clashed with bobby bonilla over bonilla s distaste for being the designated hitter ripken balked at moving to third base , and some close to ripken said he felt betrayed by the way johnson handled the situation less than three days after the yankees eliminated the orioles in the american league championship series last october , angelos directed the hiring of a new pitching coach , ray miller , and ordered johnson to fire his pitching coach and close friend , pat dobson johnson was not pleased , and for the next few days , newspapers spilled over with reports of tension and of angelos s dissatisfaction with johnson i do n't think there was ever a situation there , other than the one davey created himself , angelos says now that dispute between davey and bobby was one that caused problems for the team and both of them now that bobby s no longer with the team , there s no longer a problem but , conversely , that would apply if davey was no longer with the team , so you ca n't blame bobby angelos was reportedly perturbed with johnson s practice of criticizing players publicly , and furious that johnson did not mount a more spirited defense of roberto alomar after the player s spitting incident late last season with umpire john hirschbeck \( the orioles maintain that hirschbeck precipitated the confrontation by swearing at alomar \) now everything in the clubhouse is sedate , the orioles are performing and they stand six and a half games ahead of the yankees after today s 51 loss to kansas city the bullpen johnson wanted improved is the game s most effective johnson has curbed his public criticism of players bonilla departed as a free agent , ripken has adapted to third base and is having a terrific season and the pitchers have responded to miller we have n't had any problems , first baseman rafael palmeiro said johnson s style , angelos said , can generate good results , as we see usually people who own teams , or general managers , sometimes resent that kind of personality someone who is a subordinate and is expected to take orders , rather than just do what they want to do johnson views disagreements as constructive if you do n't hire someone to make a difference , johnson said , you can hire anybody hire your uncle , your best friend throw him in there and tell him what you want i always thought disagreement and offering opinions was very healthy winning might be the only way he can prove his point as angelos said , as long as johnson is winning , you cannot say anything other than he is doing a great job photo davey johnson s accomplishments as a manager have sometimes been overshadowed by personality clashes \( associated press \)
nablus , west bank , aug 7 by almost any measure , col sameh kanan is exactly the sort of palestinian on whom the israeli authorities would have to depend to carry out any new wave of arrests of islamic militants colonel kanan , a top official of the palestinian preventive security force in the west bank , speaks hebrew and has cooperated with the israelis on many previous cases he is credited with saving dozens of israeli lives by defusing a clash last fall between israelis and palestinians at joseph s temple in nablus but since the suicide bombing in jerusalem last week , this man , who is a top adviser to col jibril rajoub , the director of preventive security in the west bank and the most important palestinian security official , has not even spoken to any of his counterparts in israeli intelligence nor , at least for now , do he or any of his colleagues have any intention of arresting suspected militants , the key action israel is demanding before any resumption of the stalled peace talks indeed , just as israel has pulled back from ties with the palestinians on grounds that the palestinian authority has failed to honor a commitment to clamp down hard on terrorism , these security officers are following a line of noncooperation laid down by yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , since israel announced a series of punitive measures after the suicide bombing in hours of conversations this week , colonel kanan and several other senior palestinian officers expressed equal measures of resentment , despair and alarm at what they see as israeli intransigence and they expressed their concern that making any arrests would further inflame ordinary palestinians , who they say are already suspicious that mr arafat has made too many concessions and that israel has provided too few rewards the people will not support such measures because the siege is in place and there is no peace process , said col ziad habreih , the preventive security chief in nablus that means that we can offer them no reason for taking such measures his comments reflected the refusal by the palestinian security forces to go along with israel s farreaching demands for a general crackdown on militants one of the measures israel has vowed to maintain until the palestinians vigorously crack down is a halt in disbursement of money it owes to the palestinian authority one direct effect is that , like most of the 78 , 000 civil servants and police officers who work for the authority , none among the 1 , 500member preventive security force in the west bank have received the monthly paycheck that was due last week colonel kanan said israel has provided virtually no evidence to support its demands that the palestinians arrest the 150 militants named on various israeli lists and that it disarm many others he also said the deterioration of the partnership between the israelis and the palestinians had made it virtually impossible for the palestinian authorities to justify to ordinary citizens , and particularly to islamic conservatives , why they would agree to the israeli requests together , he said , the combination of pressure tactics , financial deprivation and exorbitant demands has left the palestinians in an untenable position it s like handcuffing a man , throwing him into the water , and then telling him to swim , colonel kanan said the sentiments expressed by the palestinian officers underscore the quandary facing mr arafat as he decides how to respond to the demands imposed by israel and reinforced from washington this week by president clinton and other top american officials the palestinians have acted in the past to arrest large numbers of suspected militants , particularly after four suicide bombings in february and march 1996 , when they arrested more than 1 , 500 people but fewer than 100 of them are still behind bars , a fact israelis are quick to point out as evidence that mr arafat has not acted seriously to root out terrorists today , advisers to mr arafat are plainly worried that support for him among ordinary palestinians , which is already shaky , could plummet further if he is seen either as kowtowing to the israelis or as unfairly punishing islamic conservatives we have laws , said colonel habreih we kept some of those people in prison for six or seven months without being charged , and this is against the law the palestinian authority is not a tool of the netanyahu government it is an independent force the officers said they were particularly upset by suggestions that the palestinian authorities bore responsibility for last week s terror attack , which killed 13 israelis and the 2 bombers in a crowded jerusalem market the attackers have not been identified , but the israeli government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu has said the operation could have been carried out only with the support of islamic extremists in palestinianruled areas they ca n't find the bombers , so they want to blame the palestinian authority , colonel kanan said netanyahu should blame himself , because it happened in jerusalem
washington , jan 19 in the daily life of american soldiers , few perks are as prized as shopping at the base department store , which sells almost everything from lingerie to lawn fertilizer at cutrate prices but regulations adopted in 1949 to protect momandpop stores outside the base from unfair government competition also spell out in quirky detail what the military stores , or post exchanges , cannot sell the exchanges , called px s by generations of gi s , may sell television sets , for example , but none with screens larger than 27 inches they may sell rugs , but none larger than 9 by 12 feet and they may sell cheaper , readytoassemble furniture , but not fancy mahogany dining tables the pentagon has proposed lifting the remaining restrictions next month , arguing that family businesses have largely succumbed to big discounters like kmart and walmart , and that troops are clamoring for bigscreen tv s , highend computers , foreignmade microwave ovens and other products the exchanges are barred from selling the dynamics in the retail sector render these restrictions obsolete and present an unfair burden to our servicemen and women , frederick pang , an assistant secretary of defense , wrote to the house and senate military committees recently but under intense lobbying from trade associations representing big retailers like circuit city , montgomery ward and sears , roebuck company , as well as many main street merchants , the house national security committee has ordered the pentagon to wait until congress holds hearings on the matter many businesses and chambers of commerce see this as a tremendously unfair advantage for the px s , said representative walter b jones jr , a north carolina republican who has three military bases in his district and who sits on a special house panel that is responsible for the morale , welfare and recreation of the armed forces the dispute has caught lawmakers on the house panel between their duties to improve the benefits of the allvolunteer military a vital incentive in recruiting and retaining a topquality force and the economic interests of constituents who are smallbusiness owners it s a very sensitive issue in that we have to balance the interests of the soldiers and the local community folks , said representative saxby chambliss , a georgia republican on the house panel the senate , which in the past has supported lifting the restrictions , is now taking a waitandsee approach , pending any house hearings though congress may be cool to the pentagon plan , it is a big hit with the troops and their advocates we fully support lifting the restrictions , said sydney t hickey , associate director for government relations for the national military family association , an advocacy group in alexandria , va these regulations were done to protect momandpop stores outside the gate they ai n't there no more , and it s difficult to see how walmart is a momandpop at bolling air force base s exchange here , where as many as 6 , 000 customers a day are served on weekends , military personnel voiced strong support for the proposal it s a great idea , said lieut bill shea , a 26yearold air force logistics planner , who was browsing for compact disks right now , the bigticket items is where they are really limited lieut steve smith , a 28yearold navy officer , said he spends as much as 200 a month at the exchange , and added , more selection would be better since the first exchange opened in 1895 , the stores have sold merchandise to troops , veterans and their families at prices averaging 25 percent below what other commercial stores charge that s a big difference for any service member , but particularly for a young sailor or private earning 20 , 000 a year exchanges have lower retail markups , charge no sales tax and offer cheaper financing than their commercial rivals unlike the military commissaries groceries that receive a 1 billion annual federal subsidy the exchanges are largely selfsupporting last year , the military s 360 exchanges earned 3075 million on 92 billion in sales about twothirds of the profits go toward building and maintaining recreational activities on bases , like golf courses and bowling alleys but exchange sales and the corresponding dividends to recreation funds , another important qualityoflife account , have been declining as the military has shrunk to just under 15 million troops from 21 million a decade ago pentagon officials say expanding the exchanges' wares could increase annual sales by about 106 million and bring in an additional 184 million a year for more bowling alleys , daycare centers and swimming pools on military bases this would mean waiving the limits not only on tv s and rugs sold , but also on diamond rings \( only one carat and below are sold now \) , electrical appliances that cost more than 8175 \( ruling out highend bread makers and juicers \) and some foreignmade goods , like small microwave ovens built in korea in today s retail world , the current system just does n't make sense , said robert f swarts , a retired air force major general who heads the american logistics association , a group of companies that supply the exchanges and support the pentagon plan but the powerful retail lobby on capitol hill is fighting hard to knock down the proposal , warning that unfair government competition will drive even more small retailers out of business and hurt the communities surrounding military bases what we 're saying is , 'philosophically , this is too much , ' said john j motley , senior vice president of government affairs for the national retail federation in washington it 'll undermine the local tax bases a compromise may be in the offing to let each base commander decide which of the 13 remaining restricted retail categories to lift , depending on the local economy that , representative jones said , would be a step in the right direction

cambridge , mass a librarian and literacy teacher who works in harlem has filed a 100 million libel suit against joe klein , aka anonymous , the author of the 1995 novel primary colors , and his publisher , random house daria carterclark claims that she is the basis for the character ms baum , a literacy teacher in harlem who has a fling with jack stanton , a clintonesque southern governor sprinting through a presidential primary ms carterclark says she has been defamed because the novel suggests , falsely , that she had sex with mr clinton as a novelist who was once sued for libel , i feel mr klein s pain but i also understand ms carterclark s pain , whether or not her lawsuit has merit we fiction writers have to be careful when we appropriate other people s lives for use in our work being sued is an emotionally nasty business and can cost more than two oceangoing yachts the collision of reality and fiction that provoked the suit against me concerned an odd surname i had given to an unsavory character in my first novel it was a name that swam up out of my unconscious it belonged to a teenager i 'd gone to dancing school with years earlier i ended up settling out of court because my lawyer informed me that juries in such cases generally back the plaintiff if names constitute a relatively easy shoal for a writer to avoid , real life events and people are somewhat trickier to navigate w somerset maugham , in his delicious novel cakes and ale , audaciously exploited two literary contemporaries , thomas hardy , who died shortly before the novel was written , and hugh walpole , an acquaintance saul bellow used the tormented poet delmore schwartz , who had been a contemporary in new york literary circles , as his model for the main character in humboldt s gift and philip roth , who seems to delight in taking great chunks of his and other people s lives and dropping them into his fiction , based his protagonist in the ghost writer on the novelist bernard malamud john updike , in one of his novels , gave an important character the same peculiar anomaly of the toes as that of his former wife i know this only from having seen her bare foot none of these models sued , partly , i suspect , because they were all inhabitants of a rarefied literary world where such invasions are more or less expected it s understood that in addition to imagination , most fiction writers have always relied on what and who they know to provide the blood and bones of their stories and novels and most of us who inhabit that world can live with it on the other hand , there is the case of the british poet stephen spender he sued david leavitt for plagiarism after mr leavitt wrote a novel , while england sleeps , that embroidered scenes from mr spender s autobiography in a way that the poet said he found pornographic mr leavitt s publishers in america and britain killed his book , although a reworked version was later published in the united states in a recent interview , mr leavitt acknowledged that he should have thought more about how his novel would upset mr spender but it was a failure , he explained , that resulted from the fact that i was so deeply into the novel as a novel that i forgot the real world joe klein cannot offer such an explanation though his novel tells a comingofage story about a young political aide , it s really little more than a satire of the 1992 presidential campaign despite bits of camouflage , it is obvious who all of the major and minor characters were modeled on the protagonist , for example , is clearly based on george stephanopoulos , even though the fictional character is black indeed , the book , with all the hoopla about its anonymous author , was marketed as disguised journalism here , ladies and gents , is the inside story of the clinton campaign , which we have clothed in the thinnest possible fictional dress primary colors , and the baum character , have the ring of authenticity because mr klein hewed so closely to real life but it is one thing to make fun of a public figure , especially in a book of political satire it is another when a private person is involved this is why i sympathize with ms carterclark s distress perhaps most literary types and politicians can handle the embarrassment of being identified with a fictional character of questionable virtue \( some may even enjoy the attention \) ordinary people like ms carterclark should n't have to fiction writers often base their characters on people they have known many of us need to do this but we also need to make sure we disguise these people for both their sake and ours drawing \( jason pickleman jnl \)
miami , may 11 with more than 450 million potential viewers , latin america offers a cable television market ripe for the plucking , and with that idea in mind , cnn began giving latin americans news around the clock in their own language in midmarch but there is a complication cbs already provides such a service , as do networks based in mexico , brazil and spain cable television may have arrived late and only patchily to the spanish and portuguesespeaking world but rising incomes , the introduction of satellite dishes and the proliferation of 24houraday news services have transformed latin america into one of the world s most contested paytelevision markets , pitting networks based in the united states against indigenous rivals at stake is dominance of an area that already has almost as many households with television , nearly 90 million , as the united states and is experiencing a dizzying expansion as a growing middle class embraces cable and satellites and the news and entertainment they offer with the latin american paytelevision market expected to generate at least 25 billion annually in advertising revenue and subscriber fees by the turn of the century , broadcasters say it is imperative to establish a presence now we feel the marketplace has matured to the point that a 24houraday operation makes sense both journalistically and financially , said eason jordan , executive vice president of international cnn , a unit of time warner inc latin america is an awfully big place , where the cable and satellite marketplaces are growing extraordinarily rapidly , advances in technology and systems of distribution have created new opportunities , and most countries , with the notable exception of brazil , speak the same language cnn en espanol , which went on the air march 17 , is the atlantabased network s first venture into roundtheclock news programming under its own name in a language other than english but the field is crowded cbs , for instance , has been in the market almost a year , having bought telenoticias in mid1996 from a consortium that included reuters , telemundo and the antena 3 network of spain cbs is owned by the westinghouse electric corporation but the american entrants face competitors who argue they have a longer track record or greater familiarity with the spanishlanguage news market these include eco , a nineyearold , allnews subsidiary of mexico s powerful televisa group , and tve , a news , information and entertainment channel operated by the spanish government , as well as canal sur , which rebroadcasts news programs from every major latin america country , and univision , the miamibased spanishlanguage network whose news and magazine programs are widely seen in addition , several companies are about to start portugueselanguage services aimed at brazil , the region s biggest country , with a population upward of 160 million and a cable market that is growing by 60 , 000 households a month both cbs telenoticias and eco expect to begin broadcasting sometime this year , which will put them in direct competition with a news channel offered by rede globo , brazil s leading network and a partner with time warner in a new portugueselanguage educational network scheduled to go on the air this summer thus far , none of the channels are making money , not even eco , which has been on the air since september 1988 and says it does not expect to turn a profit until 2000 but in a part of the world where illiteracy is still high and new entrants into the middle class are eager to consume , broadcasters say television offers opportunities other media do not according to a study published last month by audits and surveys , a new york media research company , the number of households in latin america with cable or satellite television jumped last year to 142 million from 109 million in 1995 , a 30 percent increase in brazil , the increase was elevenfold in addition , nearly 30 percent of all latin american subscribers belong to what the study described as the highest socioeconomic level cnn executives noted that some of the largest american , japanese and european advertisers , eager to reach the latin american audience with a single buy instead of fragmenting their budgets among 20 different countries , have been quick to sign on to the concept cbs telenoticias , which says it reaches 10 million households in 18 countries , sees its future lying in the same direction the pie is so huge that we are going to see new budgets created by the big advertisers , francisco de la torre , a former pepsico foods executive who is now president of cbs telenoticias , predicted either everyone is crazy or everyone sees a tremendous opportunity that has yet to be exploited for cbs in particular , the latin american market offers a rare second chance to make up for missed opportunity , and at a relatively cheap price in the united states , cbs moved early into cable , but was soon overtaken by its competitors we recognized right away that with cnn and msnbc out there , getting into the englishlanguage news business was an invitation to disaster , said lloyd werner , executive vice president for sales and marketing for cbs cable latin america , in contrast , he said , was an untapped market
flying home and other stories by ralph ellison edited by john f callahan 177 pp new york random house 23 the onenovel career , while hardly unique to the united states \( europe offers canetti , rilke and lampedusa , among others \) , has produced a peculiar frisson of suspense in this country in the postwar era i'm thinking not of writers who died young , like james agee , or who consummated extended literary callings with one big fictional work , like katherine anne porter , but of those who made an indelible assault on the consciousness of several generations with a prodigiously incisive novel and left us loitering , season after season , in the vain hope of a second strike three cases stand out henry roth published call it sleep in the 1930 s , but his novel belongs as much to the 60 s , when it was read and celebrated breaking what may be the longest silence in publishing history , he persevered to write a memory novel so long we are three volumes away from the finish \( the six volumes are being published individually under the collective title mercy of a rude stream \) and lingering in a zone of cautious disappointment j d salinger would undoubtedly top bestseller lists with the pitcher in the chaff , but i suspect we have given up waiting or stopped caring ralph ellison s death in 1994 , however , was a blow prayers unanswered once and for all a deconstruction of race and identity fixed on the most reverberant metaphor since melville s whale , invisible man succeeded so well in addressing what ellison called human universals that we recall with a sad jolt the admiring condescension with which it was greeted in 1952 at a time when not a few white intellectuals presumed that negro novels were or ought to be proletarian protest fiction \( and that negro novelists were or ought to be limited in their reach by a kind of intellectual ebonics \) , countless readers were encouraged to approach invisible man as a sociological inquiry into the negro condition me tarzan , you invisible not the least indication of ellison s transfigurative powers is the chagrin engendered by that memory invisible man is a reverse bildungsroman , in which a coming of age is refracted through the prism of ripened indeed , nearly fatal experience the hibernating protagonist speaks to us on the lower frequencies , from a coal bin illuminated by 1 , 369 light bulbs and the grace of louis armstrong , all powered by stolen electricity if ellison s second novel , worked on for decades , never materialized , the excerpts he infrequently let fly , as well as his essays and interviews \( a forum he made artful \) , affirmed a comic aptitude for lighting up dark places with an ungrudging lyricism that simply could not be subverted john f callahan , who assembled a volume of ellison s nonfiction for the modern library in 1995 , has been entrusted with collating the books ellison shyly or modestly or stubbornly held back the unfinished novel is said to be an immense manuscript , so perhaps an american answer to the man without qualities is still in the offing , though which of us is n't prepared to settle for less say , an ellisonian clue to life after hibernation \? ellison s early reviews , written for the new masses , have never been collected likewise , stories reworked or cut from his published and unpublished novels we are promised a more prolific posthumous career for ellison than most of us had expected flying home and other stories is a slim but shining installment , collecting 13 short stories written between 1937 and 1954 , six previously unpublished mr callahan , who commands significant editorial clout \( he effects silent emendations , omits a story he admits ellison would have included , gives titles to two stories ellison left untitled \) , has shrewdly organized the material to reflect a sequential growth that with two notable exceptions fuses the central characters as one the stories spin outward , not only from early youth to early manhood , but from the south to the north and back , from horror to horror averted they have a befitting unity , on the order of in our time or dubliners , that ellison himself could not have intended the least of these stories are distinctive , the best are gripping and two are genuinely terrifying still , it is scarcely possible to read them without noting sundry apprenticeship connections to invisible man and to ellison s most accomplished nonfiction , especially the disarmingly cheerful memoir an extravagance of laughter nor is it difficult to see why ellison dawdled over publishing them it would have been like beethoven making his name with his ninth symphony and , after 40 years' labor , proffering his first some books , however treasurable , are better dispensed by estates ellison was a master of recounting old tales from the haven of a hardwon maturity these tales are fresh , even raw many are candidly autobiographical , and even the most skillful and symbolladen betray his search for his own voice

in a nutshell , somewhere in pleasantville , ny , a dividend was cut by a company suffering from a slump , and institutions nationwide will very likely feel some pain for those clamoring for the unabridged version , the stock that they all so depend on is that of the reader s digest association , the publisher of the magazine and of the condensed versions of all those books that no one has time to read cover to cover and for anyone immersed in the nonprofit world , the institutions' current predicament is a fresh reminder of the risks of being too reliant on one source of financing the mutual dependency began as early as 1956 , when lila and dewitt wallace , the childless couple who founded the reader s digest , began a lifelong habit of stashing shares of their prosperous company in charitable foundations by the end of their lives , they had created nine charitable entities two large foundations and seven smaller organizations with a combined value just short of 500 million by the end of 1995 , after the company went public in 1990 and the stock had taken off , those entities controlled 43 billion the seven smaller entities were established for the exclusive benefit of specific organizations , five of which operate in new york lincoln center , the metropolitan museum of art , memorial sloankettering cancer center , the wildlife conservation society and two affiliated groups that buy land near the hudson river for conservation outside new york , entities were created for the benefit of colonial williamsburg and macalester college in st paul for a long time , when the stock was soaring , those arrangements were a source of envy in the philanthropic world , helping provide for these institutions' needs much the way trust funds provide perpetual care for the scions of the welltodo last year , they showered 95 million upon these seven organizations of that figure , about 64 million went to nonprofit organizations in new york , making the wallace funds the single largest private donor to new york institutions the two large foundations function in a more conventional way , doling out tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of smaller recipients but now that the business of reader s digest is deteriorating , resulting in a halving of its dividend and the departure of its chief executive , james p schadt , these organizations are holding their breath clearly , some of them will not feel the impact of smaller grants for a while because of the peculiarities of fiscal years , and others will be able to make up any slack from donors who are enjoying an otherwise exuberant stock market nonetheless , they are wondering what will become of their bighearted benefactor and are realizing that they can never again take any reader s digest money for granted the air of resignation is particularly intense in new york these grants are a significant factor in the cultural life of new york city , said linda janklow , chairwoman of lincoln center theater i would think they would be irreplaceable everybody is concerned nor are her fears very likely to subside soon the readership of the monthly digest and its books is aging , and management has been at a loss to devise ways to attract younger readers the stock has sunk to 29 a share , about half of its 1992 peak , reviving only a bit recently when michael f price , a money manager with a penchant for shaking things up at sleepy companies , signaled interest by buying a million shares to be sure , the wallaces' beneficiaries would be sitting pretty if the foundations they all depended on had parlayed more of their reader s digest stock into other assets the stock market has been kind to foundations that were fortunate enough to own a smattering of domestic stocks for instance , the ford foundation s assets rose 8 percent , to 81 billion , in 1996 , the most recent figures available , while the rockefeller foundation s holdings climbed 102 percent , to 28 billion , in that year but complete diversification never happened at the wallace funds , in part because of some complex restrictions governing how the funds can dispose of their stakes in reader s digest after mrs wallace died in 1984 , voting control passed to the two largest foundations the wallaces apparently wanted those foundations to retain control of their company , presumably so that reader s digest would stay independent and not interfere with the lush dividends that the charitable organizations were accustomed to receiving

washington , april 30 a white house panel said today that the government was still not doing enough to investigate the cause of health problems reported among gulf war veterans , criticism that helped prompt the pentagon to appoint former senator warren b rudman as a special adviser on the issue the appointment is expected to be formally announced on thursday , one day after the white house received the report in which the panel said the defense department and the central intelligence agency were not moving fast enough to determine whether american troops may have been exposed to iraqi nerve gas and other chemical weapons in the persian gulf officials said that the appointment of such a respected figure as mr rudman was meant to signal the administration s determination to end any perception that the pentagon and the cia were hiding evidence that might help explain the health problems of thousands of gulf war veterans mr rudman , a new hampshire republican , retired from the senate in 1992 and is now vice chairman of the president s foreign intelligence advisory board in the report to the white house today , the experts panel , the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans' illnesses , said the defense department was too cautious in making conclusions about incidents in which troops might have been exposed to iraqi chemical weapons though scientists are divided on the question of whether exposure to low levels of chemical weapons can lead to the sort of chronic health problems seen among gulf war veterans , the panel suggested that the government should be moving more quickly to notify veterans of the possibility that they were exposed to the poisons the committee believes that for matters involving the health of veterans , adherence to courtroom standards of evidence is inappropriate , the report said the pentagon , it said , should move as quickly as possible toward conclusions about the incidents under investigation and , when in doubt , err in favor of targeted notification of troops about possible health risks the report also said the defense department was failing to cooperate adequately with the committee , using federal privacy laws as a shield to prevent the panel from obtaining information about possible chemical exposures during the war we remain guarded in our assessment of dod s willingness to provide access to information critical to our work , the committee said a copy of the report , which is also expected to be made public on thursday , was provided to the new york times spokesmen at the cia and the defense department said they had no comment on the report because they had not yet seen it in the past , both agencies have pledged full cooperation with the white house panel , and in recent months have greatly expanded the number of investigators assigned to the matter a senior white house official involved with the issue said that although the pentagon and the cia might have moved too slowly in the past , the right things are happening now , and president clinton has a strong commitment to make sure that all the facts come out the cia and the pentagon are being responsive , the official added , and they deserve credit for that still , the advisory committee remained critical of both the pentagon and cia in today s report , especially of their investigation of the march 1991 demolition of the iraqi ammunition depot near kamisiyah thousands of american troops may have been exposed to low levels of nerve gas as a result of the demolition the report said the cia and the pentagon had no excuse for delays in producing a longawaited model of potential fallout from the demolition a preliminary model suggested that low levels of nerve gas might have traveled as far as 165 miles south of the depot , over areas of kuwait , saudi arabia and iraq where hundreds of thousands of americans were stationed after the war the cia and the pentagon have not completed the model , saying that there are too many uncertainties about what actually happened during the demolition and that a hastily completed model might unnecessarily alarm veterans and their families the advisory committee rejected those arguments the committee finds none of the barriers raised to date by cia and dod presents insurmountable obstacles or in any way justify the delay in immediately completing the modeling , the report said today s report offered no new clues to the health problems reported by veterans in january the committee issued a report that was supposed to be its final one in that report it said it did not believe chemical weapons were responsible for the health problems of gulf war veterans , although it called for more research on the issue and criticized the pentagon for failing to conduct a credible investigation of chemical exposures during the war the committee has suggested that wartime stress is likely to be a major factor in the ailments in accepting the report in january , mr clinton asked the committee to remain in business for at least several months , to oversee the government s investigation of gulf war illnesses in interviews , members of the white house panel said today that they were especially concerned over the delay in the release of the fallout model people deserve an answer , said arthur l caplan , a committee member who is a bioethicist at the university of pennsylvania the modeling should move as rapidly as possible to some extent , answers can be given now that go from the worst case to the best case another panelist , rolando rios , a lawyer from san antonio , said that while he had been impressed by steps taken by the cia and the pentagon to expand their investigations , i still believe that there was some conscious or unconscious coverup i still feel there s a resistance to accepting responsibility mr rios said he also thought the white house panel might have gone too far when it suggested in january that chemical weapons were probably not responsible for the veterans' ailments i was n't sure then that i embraced that statement wholeheartedly , and i'm even less sure now , he said i personally think that some of this could be explained by chemicals

washington , march 29 it was a dreary saturday in december 1994 , shortly after the rout of democrats in the midterm elections , and president clinton had summoned his most valued advisers for a critical strategy meeting robert b reich , mr clinton s labor secretary , liberal conscience and close friend for two decades , hopped into his jeep and headed to the white house i'm here for a meeting with the president , he told the guard at the white house gate , sounding a bit selfimportant name \? the unimpressed guard replied robert reich , secretary of labor mr reich s ego was somewhat punctured the guard deflated it completely identification \? he asked mr reich had forgotten his wallet sorry , the guard said you ca n't enter a humbled mr reich was reduced to begging the guard to find someone who knew what the secretary of labor looked like eventually , someone inside the white house provided a description over a twoway radio beard barely sees over the steering wheel and mr reich was admitted to the inner sanctum it occurs to me that any exceedingly short , bearded terrorist claiming to be robert reich would have direct access to the president , he later concluded it is not the sort of tale that cabinet officers ordinarily include in their memoirs but three months after leaving the clinton administration , mr reich is about to publish a memoir of his four years in the circle power that is anything but ordinary frequently selfdeprecating , alternately somber and hilarious , it offers what mr reich , in a telephone interview this week , called a frighteningly personal account of his stint as a government bigwig his aim , he said , is to prove the impossible that beneath the fourfigure suits and veneers of selfconfidence , washington s power elite is , for the most part , human i hope people who read the book get an understanding that the people who are in these roles are just people , mr reich , now a professor at brandeis university in waltham , mass , said on friday they have families they play jokes on themselves and others they see irony they 're scared a lot of the time they 're not larger than life they 're like other people the book , locked in the cabinet , is taken from a journal that mr reich quietly wrote when he was an adviser to mr clinton s 1992 presidential campaign and then a cabinet member in mr clinton s first term mr reich said he had not originally intended to publish its contents but after he submitted his resignation as labor secretary in november , he said , he reread the journal , hoping for a cathartic experience instead , he found a book alfred a knopf will release the distilled journal in late april mr reich s editor , jon segal , said he had rushed the book into print because he found it to be unlike anything he had ever read about politics that may stretch the truth , but not greatly the book s subtext the struggle between liberals and conservatives for mr clinton s mind is old hat mr reich s vignettes on life in the political ether are not in mr reich s washington , everyone , including the author , wears a mask of selfassurance and competence in public privately , they are as befuddled and mistakeprone as everyone else , stumbling into success and failure alike none of them is quite certain what the president believes they all are deathly afraid of the republican majority in congress , but no one is sure what to do some gaffes are painfully funny mr reich recounts how , in april 1994 , he decided to turn a labor department crackdown on a bridgestone corporation tire plant in oklahoma city into a public relations bonanza he flew to the plant and personally imposed a 75 million fine and an emergency safety order as television cameras recorded the scene if we get this story on television , we 'll embarrass the hell out of them and strike fear in the hearts of every other corporation that s hurting its workers , mr reich told his aides instead , bridgestone announced that it was closing the plant immediately because the required improvements would be too costly , throwing 1 , 100 workers onto the street the city s newspaper , the daily oklahoman , denounced mr reich as a biggovernment meddler a conservative federal judge threw out the safety order later , mr reich received some sarcastic advice it might be a good idea to check out these kinds of things before we do anything like this again , a top aide told him that advice also applies to the president like many others , mr reich suggests that mr clinton s supreme selfconfidence and magnetic charm can make him blind to trouble the white house s disastrous attempt to settle the 1995 baseball strike , mr reich writes , sprang from mr clinton s conviction that he could sell a deal to anyone his failure only underscored his political impotence at the time mr reich describes the president , mostly in admiring terms , as a man whose heart is securely in the right place but whose principles can wander to wherever the last persuasive speaker leads them sometimes that is mr reich more often , it is someone else the book can be breathtakingly blunt mr reich calls one unnamed corporate lawyer an 800anhour prostitute but with one exception , it is not especially mean that exception is dick morris , the campaign consultant who arrived at mr clinton s political nadir in 1995 and left in disgrace in august 1996 mr reich quotes george stephanopoulos , then the president s senior adviser , as warning that mr morris is utterly without principle , a man who will do anything and he expresses his own dismay as mr clinton moves toward endorsing a balanced federal budget , using mr morris s rationale that the issue appeals to suburban swing voters mr reich continued to wield considerable influence on such matters as an increase in the minimum wage , thanks to a conduit he stumbled on early in his tenure hillary rodham clinton , a sympathetic friend mrs clinton knew how to get mr reich s ideas to the president s desk send them to me , she is said to have told mr reich i 'll make sure they get to him use blank sheets of paper without any letterhead or other identifying characteristics just the date and your initials mr reich was giddy now i have my own loop , he writes photo robert b reich has written about his four years in the cabinet \( associated press \)
because of the strong runup in the united states stock market , investors may be eager to add to their stakes in overseas markets , expecting more value abroad but they wo n't achieve the diversification benefits promised by advisers if they buy shares in the typical foreign fund , warns tricia o rothschild in a recent edition of morningstar mutual funds here is why , according to ms rothschild , the international editor of the newsletter assetallocation formulas that show the advantages of diversification are usually based on the standard poor s 500stock index \( the proxy for united states stock markets \) and the morgan stanley europe , australia and far east index \( the proxy for overseas markets \) while the s p is a good marker of largecap american equity funds , the average foreign stock fund looks nothing like the morgan stanley eafe the primary reason , ms rothschild explains , is that the japanese market accounts for nearly onethird of the eafe , but less than 20 percent of the average foreign fund japanese markets , quirky though they may be , tend not to move in close relationship to united states markets so it s no wonder that foreign funds fail to deliver the promised diversification benefits over the last five years , the s p index showed declines in 15 months , while the average foreign fund lost money in 80 percent of those months , too and returns can be disappointing the average foreign fund has not performed as well as the eafe over the last 20 years ms rothschild says a small group of foreign funds holds out the possibility of better diversification international smallcapitalization funds , a relatively new group that focuses on smaller companies that are n't tied to multinational trends such funds are also more likely to hold stocks in emerging markets and when the united states stock market has struggled , the foreign small caps have held up slightly better than their largercap cousins none of this means that diversified international funds ca n't make great investments , she says funds like gam international , europacific growth and templeton foreign are in the top 15 percent of all funds for the last decade but for diversification , she says , investors should look closely at their international choices wage pressure at the top american workers may be gaining only slightly on the wage front , but the top

washington , feb 11 in her first public appearance on capitol hill as secretary of state , madeleine k albright today asserted that family planning was an important component of the united states' foreign policy and urged congress to support an administrationbacked measure that would speed the release of money for familyplanning programs overseas the house is to vote on thursday on such a measure , as well as on an alternative that would bar aid from the united states to groups that perform abortions , even if they use private money for that purpose ms albright , making the administration s strongest statement yet on family planning , called it an important tool by which the united states could demonstrate world leadership one of the most important ways we contribute to sustainable development is through our support for international family planning , ms albright told a packed hearing of the house international relations committee as she sought an increase in the state department s budget by stabilizing population growth rates , developing nations can devote more of their scarce resources to meet the basic needs of their citizens , she said moreover , our voluntary familyplanning programs serve our broader interests by elevating the status of women , reducing the flow of refugees , protecting the environment and promoting economic growth the familyplanning programs have come under fire from antiabortion forces , who contend that they are actually conduits for what many of them call president clinton s worldwide abortion crusade in addition , some opponents of the administration s measure , like steven w mosher of the population research institute , which opposes contraception , accuse the united states of a contraceptive imperialism at a news conference on monday that featured representative christopher smith , republican of new jersey , and senator tim hutchinson , republican of arkansas , mr mosher said that overpopulation of the world was a myth and that money from the united states was used disproportionately for family planning at the expense of basic health and hygiene the administrationbacked resolution would speed the release of money allocated last year but withheld until july 1997 if released on march 1 , as the administration wants , the money available between then and sept 30 , the end of the 1997 fiscal year , would amount to 215 million if delayed until july , the sum would amount to 92 million , a loss of 123 million an alternative measure , offered by mr smith , would provide 385 million for family planning , but only on the condition that none of the money go to any organization that performs abortions , even if it finances them with money from other sources while both measures could conceivably pass the house , the smith bill would face a tougher time in the senate and would be vetoed by president clinton at today s hearing , mr smith pointedly questioned ms albright as he asserted that the administration was bent on undermining antiabortion laws in many of the countries where the united states sends familyplanning money through the agency for international development i believe the real consensus is with providing family planning funds , mr smith said , but not , however unwittingly , empowering the proabortion movement overseas to bring down the righttolife laws as they exist in approximately 100 countries of the world ms albright responded the us does not fund the performance or promotion of abortion anywhere in the world and what we are concerned about is that the restrictions that are envisioned in your language would preclude usaid from working with organizations that provide effective , voluntary family planning and women s health services in countries where abortion is legal she added , i think the issue here , sir , is that we desperately need the money in order to try to get women out of the terrible poverty that has existed planned parenthood took two russian pediatricians to congress on monday to brief legisators on what they described as the benefits of the united statesbacked familyplanning efforts the russians said that since contraceptives had become more available , abortions in russia had dropped to 27 million in 1995 , from 44 million in 1989 one of the doctors , inga i grebesheva , director general of the russian association of family planning in moscow , said russia s birth rate had dwindled as a result of postabortion complications that had left women infertile unlike in other countries , where family planning was intended partly to check overpopulation , she said russia hoped that family planning would help rebuild the population by preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and curbing the need for abortions , which are often performed in unsanitary conditions mr smith and his supporters have characterized thursday s vote as the first abortionrelated vote of the new congress , a characterization that may help pressure some abortion opponents in the house into voting with them for that same reason , supporters of family planning strongly reject such a characterization if the vote is cast in terms of abortion instead of family planning , they would probably lose votes in the house , where a majority of members oppose abortion as a matter of policy and law , the federal money cannot be used for abortions , even though mr smith argues that because money is interchangeable , the federal money frees up other money to be used for this purpose kate bunting , a spokeswoman for care , one of the international relief and development organizations that receives federal money for family planning overseas , said , we do not pay for abortions with our private money we do n't even have an organizational position on abortion ms bunting said approval of the administration s resolution on thursday would depend on prolife members' making the distinction and understanding that providing familyplanning services will in fact reduce abortion
warsaw , june 7 as krzysztof bertram rushes through the hectic pace of his daily life , balancing studies in business with work at an insurance company , he has little doubt where his country should be headed for sure poland has to join nato , said the crisply dressed mr bertram , 27 , as he checked out courses at the warsaw polytechnic that might further his career the balance of power has changed the soviet union is not around anymore , and i think nato will be the organization to provide security for the world mr bertram is enjoying the increased material wellbeing that has come to poland as it progresses toward a market economy poles want to secure that new prosperity , but their overwhelming support for admission into nato also suggests their almost reflexive fear of russia , and a desire to be enveloped in a western security blanket three central european countries are lined up for admission in july poland , the czech republic and hungary poland is the most enthusiastic , but for all three , joining nato is seen as a longterm economic advantage , because it brings them closer to western europe still , there is nervousness over how the costs of military upgrading will be met , particularly in the governments of hungary and the czech republic the alliance is also considering membership for romania and slovenia , where popular sentiment for joining is overwhelming the united states has shown lukewarm interest in expanding the list of newcomers to five , but with nine of the 16 nato members in favor of admitting romania and slovenia , the possibility is being discussed in washington the leaders of the three likeliest new members from the czech president , vaclav havel , and the former polish president , lech walesa , who initially pressed the nato case with president clinton , to the hungarian prime minister , gyula horn , and the current polish president , aleksander kwasniewski have campaigned in the halls of washington and brussels to join nato on the home front , too , they have pushed the idea of joining nato though with little explanation of costs or responsibilities as a panacea to all kinds of problems , a golden bridge to the west one of the most enduring , almost interchangeable , television images in these three nations , the most economically advanced of central europe , has been of presidents and prime ministers boarding planes to western capitals with a wave , and returning days later with the solemn pledge that entry into nato headquarters is all but certain but their nations , often lumped together in the american psyche as former warsaw pact allies , have their own histories , military traditions and world outlooks in poland , where there is an almost visceral fear of russia based on more than a century of russian rule and about 75 years of soviet communism , support of the north atlantic treaty organization has been consistently strong it was at 79 percent five years ago and climbed to 88 percent in march , according to obop , a polling firm those against joining nato have not exceeded more than 14 percent and now number 3 percent , obop surveys show this popular support stems largely from the geographic difficulty of being sandwiched between germany and russia , and from serving as a stamping ground for both despite its many setbacks , which include the nazis' rapid conquest of the country in 1939 , poland s military has always been held in high regard among its citizens , in contrast to the armies in the rest of central europe today , the polish military is impoverished and poorly equipped compared with its standing in the communist era , but the army continues to rank as the most esteemed institution in the country , above state and church most poles reckon that whatever is good for the army is good for the country being in nato has to be good for the army , goes the argument another ingredient in the polish zest for nato , say analysts , is the strong link with the united states many polish families have a relative in the united states , and a proamerican sentiment reinforces the acclaim for nato in contrast to poland , support in the czech republic for nato ranges from 28 percent to 42 percent , depending on how the question is phrased , according to zdenek borkovec , the director for the department for nato cooperation in the ministry of defense mr borkovec said he discounted a recent poll commissioned by the czech ministry of foreign affairs that showed a level of support exceeding 50 percent czechs feel secure , said mr borkovec , as a way of explaining the thinness of support they are occupied by private problems and czechs are not informed about nato they need more information historically , czechs have held a low opinion of their army , he said , adding , people say our army never fought for our country indeed , a favorite aphorism of the czechs is that their army has not fought since the battle of white mountain in 1620 when the bohemian army lost badly in modern times in 1938 , when the germans marched in in 1948 , when the communists took over and in 1968 , when the warsaw pact invaded the army stood by

when the the metrostars signed two brazilian soccer players last month , santiago formoso knew how to make them feel at home he suggested they move to the ironbound section of newark , where formoso lived for a year when he moved to this country 30 years ago guido alvez pereira neto , 21 , and joao luiz ferreira baptista , 25 , known in the brazilian soccer tradition by their first names , speak only portuguese , but in the markets , banks and restaurants of their new neighborhood so does nearly everyone else ironbound , which has been a settlement for portuguese immigrants for nearly a half century , has seen its brazilian population grow over the last 10 years for the new metrostars , the neighborhood , which has nearly 30 , 000 portuguesespeaking residents , has made what could have been an overwhelming transition bearable , especially for joao luiz , his wife , martha , and their 15monthold son , lucas , none of whom had been to the united states guido was here for a week last year while playing in a tournament when you go from rio to new jersey , it is quite a shock , said formoso , a former defender for the cosmos who now works in the metrostars' front office he has served as an interpreter , chauffeur and real estate agent , among other things , since the two players arrived the first day , you could see it in their faces , they were shocked , formoso said but on the second day , i took them to a brazilian restaurant and their faces began to light up for guido , joao luiz and his family , a plate of red beans and rice never tasted quite so good i miss brazil , joao luiz said through a translator in a recent interview but i am learning to like it here , too once i learn to speak english and meet some people here , i will like it even better everything from brazilian newspapers , to the food items at the corner market , to portuguese television broadcast by satellite and watched on cable at the diners , can be found on the tightly knit ironbound streets many of the signs on the buildings are written in portuguese and english moving to the portuguese community has made everything much easier , martha said at a recent metrostars practice while the adjustment to american culture has been made easier by the neighborhood , the transition to american soccer has been more difficult for guido , a midfielder , and joao luiz , a defender the game moves faster in major league soccer than it does in the brazilian leagues but faster surely does not mean better , joao luiz quickly pointed out in the last world cup tournament , held in the united states in 1994 , the brazilian national team won with carlos alberto parreira as coach i do n't feel that the soccer in the us is weaker than in brazil , joao luiz said they are just different styles i'm conditioned to play this kind of soccer it is faster paced and more exciting in brazil there is more strategy in the us , it is more attack , attack , attack parreira , a brazilian who is now the metrostars' coach , first saw guido and joao luiz play while he was coaching the brazilian national team in 1994 at the time , guido was playing for the sao paolo youth team , and joao luiz was playing for vasco de gama of the brazilian first division , his third season as a pro guido and joao luiz can become very good players , parreira said i like them because they are very good technically they are young and they were not very expensive to bring here since the arrival of the brazilians , the metrostars have gone 32 , with a season record of 35 guido has played in five games and joao luiz has played in four as formoso searched ironbound for new homes for the two brazilians , he recognized that the large soccer following in the community might be attracted to the metrostars because of their new neighbors bringing these players here benefits both parties , formoso said much is being asked of these two players , especially since they are so far from everything and everyone they grew up with this was a very good thing for them to live in newark , said parreira , who now lives in manhattan when i was their age , i played in the middle east , very far from my home in brazil i suffered a lot then what i learned is that you have to be happy to perform well photo joao luiz ferreira baptista , left , and guido alvez pereira neto are the newest brazilian connection for american professional soccer in the metropolitan area \( norman y lono for the new york times \)
eve s apple by jonathan rosen 312 pages random house 24 there is a brief , suggestive reference to a hunger artist by franz kafka in this impressive , psychologically rich first novel by jonathan rosen the kafka story , disturbing and mysterious like all kafka stories , is much admired by one of mr rosen s two main characters , ruth simon , who is a kind of hunger artist herself , a bright middleclass new yorker in her early 20 s who is afflicted with anorexia nervosa , an eating disorder that most often strikes young , smart women a hunger artist is by no means the model for mr rosen s book , which has none of the matteroffactness in the face of the grotesque so characteristic of kafka but eve s apple and a hunger artist are similar in at least one important respect , aside from their use of food as a central human preoccupation the kafka tale could be construed as a story about the man who , with overweening pride in his skill , fasts for 40day stretches before crowds of onlookers , but it is really about the onlookers themselves , who feast on his selfstarvation and then spit him out with boredom similarly , it would be easy to think of mr rosen s tale as a story about a woman with an eating disorder but eve s apple is narrated by joseph , ruth s boyfriend , and what he tells is a story about himself , about his grappling with his own egoistic tendency to mix up love and need , hubris and generosity , so as to become a kind of hunger artist himself eve s apple , in this sense , is a quietly powerful exploration of a theme as old as the story of adam and eve , a theme that mr rosen , with his aptitude for subtle psychological examination , has transformed into an absorbing , intelligent tale of love and the mysteriousness of the other joseph and ruth are a young couple , recently graduated from college , who live together in new york joseph , who is uncertain about his future , teaches english at a school for recent russian immigrants , whose gritty , funny sense of realism contrasts with the unhappiness of affluent nativeborn americans ruth studies art , goes every morning for a session with her therapist and struggles with her illness , in part by minutely recording , with poetic terseness , the fluctuations in her image of herself in her diary the flaw in the idyll of this attractive young couple , the sole obstacle to our happiness , as joseph puts it , is ruth s eating disorder , which fills her lover both with dread that she might destroy herself and with a powerful need to save her as he introduces ruth and himself , joseph prefigures the discovery he is destined to make as the story unfolds people have always valued me for my calm exterior , for my carefully cultivated optimism , he says what he is to discover is that darker desires lurked in him as well as in ruth , that he loved ruth not in spite of her condition but , much less wholesomely , because of it gradually , mr rosen sketches in the growth of joseph s obsession even as he fills in the essential background ruth s supposedly loving , nightmarishly withholding parents are a part of the background but joseph , too , while having learned to banish the ghost of sadness from my own life , is haunted by the suicide some years earlier of his older sister , evelyn stealthily , he reads the diary that ruth keeps in her dresser drawer and that chronicles her bouts of bingeing and selfstarvation , her disgust for food , her simultaneous addiction to it and her feelings for joseph as an act of love \( he assumes \) , joseph embarks on a kind of intellectual quest , to understand ruth and to rescue her from herself , carefully keeping his library research to himself i thrilled to the strange sensation of researching ruth , he says , sitting in the main reading room of the new york public library bingeing on books about eating disorders , uncovering the horrors of human selfannihilation i could not have formulated exactly what i hoped to find , but i was drawn by some dream of salvation , as if ruth s voice murmured to me out of the muffled echoes of the marble hall , whispering up from the riffled pages of borrowed books mr rosen is in impressive control of these interlocked secret lives his portraits of ruth s divorced parents , whose main characteristic is a kind of constant hunger for more , is grippingly well done his own vision of things seems to be provided by one of his characters , ernest flek , a kind of defrocked psychoanalyst and a figure of power , physical and intellectual , even though childhood polio has left him crippled joseph , falling deeper into his obsession , seeks flek out to talk about ruth , to get the answer to the question of her illness flek , who advises him about the ultimate inaccessibility the otherness of the other , wants him to talk about his sister s suicide ca n't you see , joseph \? he says you 're not just trying to save ruth you 're trying to solve the riddle of female sadness itself you 're trying to solve the selfdestructive urge of humanity you 're trying to crack the mystery of the body enlivening the narrative is the intelligence of the two main characters , their wellroundedness joseph is the kind of young man who can ruminate on the links between anorexia and the judeochristian god was our conception of god a part of the problem , a representation of the disembodiment we all longed for \? he asks while reading in the library ruth , on a vacation in paris where her father has sent her as a gift , writes to joseph worrying about her sylvia plathetudes i feel like the things that should keep me together are just tiny inside me , the way i was tiny in the cathedral , she writes enriching the tale , also , is the theme of hunger , literal hunger and metaphorical hunger , the hunger of adam and eve for knowledge and of contemporary men and women for love and power and control mr rosen , in other words , has developed his theme into a full world of moral and spiritual ambiguities in a novel that is enjoyable to read , even suspenseful in its way , and intellectually provocative photo jonathan rosen \( mark berghash random house \)
when corporate america needs help coping with the uncertainties of change , it often turns to andersen worldwide the savvy of the information technology specialists of andersen consulting and the prowess of the accounting experts at arthur andersen have made the andersen name ubiquitous but after the embarrassing news this week that the partners in andersen worldwide had failed for a second time to elect a new chief executive , the firm faced an inescapable conclusion it is pulling against itself in a tugofwar without a winner , hampered by a fraying governance structure the problem , simply stated , is one of tension and mistrust between the two sides of andersen worldwide reflecting the company s roots , the 1 , 700 auditing and tax partners at arthur andersen outnumber the 1 , 000 partners at andersen consulting , and partners from the auditing side likewise hold twothirds of the seats on the company s 27member board but the consulting partners bring in more revenue per partner and generally resent sharing those profits with the accountants veterans of arthur andersen speak with fatherly pride about the success of the consulting unit they formed in 1989 , but with the son s quick growth , any feelings of gratitude have long since faded although andersen prides itself on applying the lessons from its broad base of experience to its clients' challenges , the firm appears , for the first time , to be stumped throughout its 84year history , partners had never rejected a nominee for chief executive but last month , jim wadia , managing partner in britain for arthur andersen , failed to get the requisite twothirds vote of the partners for the firm s top job and this week , the nominating commission s second choice george t shaheen , managing partner for andersen consulting also fell short that left the company out of answers theirs were the only names on the list the board quickly convened in new york yesterday for what was scheduled to be a twoday meeting at an undisclosed hotel to figure out the next step insiders say the options include opening a search for new candidates , conducting a runoff between mr shaheen and mr wadia or prevailing upon the current chief executive , lawrence a weinbach , to stay on past aug 31 , when he is scheduled to step down it is unlikely , they say , that andersen will turn to an outsider to impose order on its unruly nest , and it is also unlikely that the firm will break up over the impasse mr weinbach himself is unsure of the outcome nobody ever conceived that this could happen , he said in an interview on thursday i wish this process was over it may not be soon mr weinbach acknowledged that the rapid growth of andersen consulting had put the structure of the parent firm s board out of balance the governance is disproportionate and needs to be reviewed , he said industry experts said they believed andersen s difficulties were only a minor distraction to clients i think their competitors would like to assume that this is causing andersen to be confused in delivering its services , said arthur w bowman , editor of bowman s accounting report , an industry newsletter but i do n't think that s a fact the internal stalemate belies the lock step that the company works so hard to achieve it will spend about 6 percent of its anticipated 1997 revenues of 11 billion on training its 101 , 000 employees in such things as how to assess a client s hardware and software needs the goal of such heavy investment in training is to create a consistent andersen way of doing things , even as its young and energetic work force turns over at a rate of about 15 percent a year and while the struggle will no doubt entertain competitors who dismiss andersen s successful but regimented employees as andersen androids , they may also want to study its lessons to apply to their own clients' woes like many companies across country including such giants as ual , parent of united airlines , science applications international and many accounting and consulting firms , as well andersen has embraced the notion of employee ownership but while many of its peers give partners' votes different weights or assign more authority to the centralized portions of their farflung organizations , andersen worldwide is more democratic the firm likes to say it has no global headquarters board members fly in to meetings from all over the world each partner s vote carries equal weight , and power does not diminish at outlying offices most of the time , this system works for andersen , which almost doubled in size from 1992 to 1996 , when revenues reached 95 billion growth this year is expected to reach 17 percent but democracy at andersen is a twoedged sword , mr weinbach acknowledged a cumbersome election process , for example , may be partly to blame for andersen s recent embarrassment a nominating commission surveys partners on the qualities they want in their leader and asks for suggestions on candidates the board then passes on the commission s slate but rather than put multiple candidates up for a vote of the partners , the candidates are offered up one at a time relying on support in their respective camps , mr wadia and mr shaheen each won more than half the partners' votes , but failed to get the twothirds they needed
rancho santa fe , calif , march 31 the authorities today released the last two names of the heaven s gate cult members found dead in the mass suicide here and said they were moving to wrap up their investigation because they had no evidence that any crime had been committed and no indication that other people had been involved in the 39 deaths after repeated unsuccessful efforts over the weekend to reach the families of the last members to be publicly identified , the san diego county medical examiner s office announced their names at a news conference this afternoon they were identified as alphonzo ricardo foster , a 44yearold man with a minnesota driver s license , and lindley ayerhart pease , 41 , a man who was born in exeter , nh , and had no driver s license we 're in the process of concluding our investigation , pending any additional information , said lieut gerald l lipscomb , head of the homicide unit of the san diego county sheriff s office he said his department had received numerous tips and rumors , many of them apparently unfounded , about possible activities by former members of the cult and had passed them on to the federal bureau of investigation and relevant lawenforcement agencies in other states the rumors are going rampant , and some of them are very bizarre , lieutenant lipscomb said but he added that we have absolutely nothing to shake the conviction that all who died had done so in a group suicide , and no indication that they 're affiliated with anyone in the world beyond the group of 39 lieutenant lipscomb said fbi computer experts were considering whether to come to san diego to spend four to six weeks examining about a dozen computers and many , many diskettes taken from the home where the group died , or whether to have the computers sent to fbi headquarters he said the police had so far made no effort to review the group s financial records and did not perceive any urgency to do so we do n't want to enter a computer and possibly damage anything , he said the county medical examiner , dr brian blackbourne , said toxicological tests had shown that the last two members of the cult to die found in a separate room with plastic bags still over their heads had taken large doses of vicodin , which contains a semisynthetic opiate and apparently killed them officials had earlier disclosed that the members had committed suicide in stages , with the last to die helping the others and placing distinctive purple shrouds over their heads and shoulders dr blackbourne said all the autopsies had been completed by late saturday and had done nothing to change his view that most members had died of lethal doses of phenobarbital combined with vodka , or of suffocation from plastic bags found in the garbage outside the house but he said the precise cause of death for each person would be established only after the completion of toxicological tests , which could occur by the end of this week lieutenant lipscomb said the authorities were still trying to determine how the cult had got the controlled drugs , but he speculated that members who had prescriptions for legitimate conditions could have stockpiled the drugs and he said many prescription drugs were easy to buy just across the border in tijuana , mexico updating his earlier estimate that perhaps a halfdozen of the 18 men found dead had been castrated , dr blackbourne said a final tally showed that the actual number was eight their testicles were surgically removed some time ago without excessive scarring , he said last week , dr blackbourne confirmed that the group s leader , marshall herff applewhite , was among those castrated , but today he said that his office would not elaborate on the condition of any individual body or say which bodies had been claimed by family members this is not something they did themselves , dr blackbourne said of the castrations but he added , it s not something a normal , legitimate physician would do on an individual on request two of the dead women were nurses , he said , but he had no idea whether they might have performed the procedures dr blackbourne said that as of midday , 11 bodies had been released to mortuaries and that more would be released by the end of the day he said none of the dead had been suffering from any terminal illness one of the 21 women found had undergone a hysterectomy and another a tubal ligation , which he said was not an unusual ratio in a group of this age and composition he also said that blood from all the bodies would be tested for hiv , the aids virus , which he described as a routine procedure in such cases calvin vine , the supervising investigator for the medical examiner s office , said that despite 2 , 300 calls from worried families around the country to a county hot line established last week , investigators could not find the families of the last two cult members to be publicly identified he appealed for assistance from the public records with mr foster s body showed that he was born on nov 3 , 1952 , in detroit , and mr vine said investigators believed that he had two sisters , juanita and felicia , and a brother , ramon but he said checks in michigan , wisconsin and minnesota had produced no leads mr pease , who was born on oct 2 , 1955 , had a sister , sylvia , whose last known address was in palm springs , calif , but mr vine said investigators had been unable to locate her after sealing the site of the suicides last week as a potential crime scene and removing bunk beds and other belongings all weekend , the county authorities said today that they had released their control of the luxurious house where the cult had lived since last october there were indications that one or more residents of this exclusive community were interested in buying the sevenbedroom hilltop retreat to raze it and resell the land for redevelopment ann mcgregor , an agent for dyson dyson real estate associates , said there are several gentlemen who are thinking of purchasing the home for something near its asking price of about 15 million , but a spokesman for the listing agent said he had received no formal offers nick matzorkis , a beverly hills businessman whose employee received farewell videotapes from the cult , said today that heaven s gate members had also sent computer disks explaining their suicides one member , referring to mr applewhite by his adopted name of do , wrote that she needed to leave the planet because do was leaving and she could not stand to go on without him , mr matzorkis said the employee who received the disks , a former cult member who first discovered the bodies , is out of town , mr matzorkis said , getting his head together and planning to do some form of interviews after the media frenzy goes down , when he will deliver a very clear account photos lieut gerald l lipscomb made public yesterday the last two names from the mass suicide \( associated

jerusalem , march 12 prime minister benjamin netanyahu declared today that he was fed up with accusations that everything he did violated the israelipalestinian peace accords even more criticism is expected this weekend at an international meeting on peace issues being convened by the palestinians in gaza to which israel was not invited mr netanyahu made his comments at a news conference in moscow at the conclusion of his visit there after several days of attacks on his decisions to build a new jewish neighborhood in east jerusalem and to withdraw from portions of the west bank that the palestinians rejected as far too small the attacks included a bitter and personal letter from king hussein of jordan , who accused mr netanyahu of destroying the peace and threatening to unleash a new wave of violence if he persisted on his course i'm getting frankly fed up with the idea that everything we do is a violation of the agreement , and everything the palestinians say is in compliance with the agreement , mr netanyahu told the press if the palestinians are serious about peace , let them sit down with us if they are serious about airing their differences , let them sit down with us but for now , the palestinian leader , yasir arafat , is evidently not prepared to sit down , or even talk to mr netanyahu israeli television said he refused to answer two telephone calls from mr netanyahu on monday , and was refusing to meet with his representatives instead mr arafat prepared to convene the meeting in gaza to discuss the state of the israelipalestinian peace agreements , to which he invited the united states , russia , the european union , japan , norway , jordan and egypt but not israel mr netanyahu reacted angrily to the plan , telling reporters in moscow the attempt to convene an international conference is a clear violation of the oslo accords , because in the accords there is a system for working out conflicts the supreme steering committee and when arafat refuses to talk to a prime minister and he convenes such a conference , that is a violation of the agreement despite the israeli position , the united states was among the first to announce it would attend the state department said it would be represented by the united states consul general in jerusalem , edward g abington , whose major responsibility is contact with the palestinians american officials said they regarded the gathering as a normal meeting with mr arafat , from which there would be no joint statement or resolution we regard this as a briefing by arafat on developments in the peace process , said the united states ambassador to israel , martin s indyk we do not see it as an alternative forum in any way whatsoever to the direct process of negotiations last week the united states , which had been critical of the israeli decision to build the housing , vetoed a united nations security council resolution condemning the planned new jewish neighborhood in east jerusalem , drawing angry reactions from some palestinians we find it difficult to understand the us , said yasir abed rabbo , the palestinian minister of information on the one hand it says it does not accept israel s behavior , and on the other it pretends it cannot do a thing the assault on israel s housing plan continued at the united nations today at a session of the general assembly the united states was also reported to be putting pressure on mr netanyahu to postpone the start of construction in east jerusalem , and to make some gestures toward the palestinians that might allay the anger when construction does start , like allowing the palestinians to open their airport in gaza so far no work has begun on the har homa site in east jerusalem israel has also taken no measures yet to enforce its order to the palestinians to close four offices that the israelis assert violate a ban on palestinian authority activity in jerusalem king hussein s sharp letter to mr netanyahu was published in several major israeli newspapers today , with varying reactions the rightofcenter maariv wrote in an editorial that none of the king s assertions justify the uncontrolled outbreak of rage , written and oral , by hussein the leftleaning haaretz , by contrast , saw the letter as evidence that mr netanyahu had violated the spirit of the oslo peace agreements and was responsible for the crisis in israelijordanian relations what is the good of a literal implementation of the agreement if the manner of fulfillment overshadows it , causing deep distrust and hostility \? an editorial in haaretz said many morning talk shows , which are highly popular in israel , featured speculation about king hussein s state of mind , evidently prompted by reports that mr netanyahu had made a comment about the king s stability in the evening , the prime minister s office issued a statement describing those reports as outrageous slander the prime minister was talking about the need for stability in relations between nations , the statement said he was in no way referring to personalities or individuals the war of words between mr netanyahu and the king continued today addressing king hussein s talk of inevitable violence , mr netanyahu said , this kind of doomsday talk and the whole histrionic attitude toward obvious disagreement is itself not conducive to the process king hussein repeated some of the assertions expressed in his letter in an interview with cnn broadcast today he said that there was an air of crisis over the peace talks , and that mr arafat had been reduced to a state of complete despair the king left today on a trip to spain and the united states
washington , april 19 a governor who raised tobacco taxes to expand health care coverage in his own state says that the cigarette tax is not an unpopular tax to raise , except perhaps within the confines of the beltway appearing on friday before the senate labor and human resources committee , the governor , howard dean of vermont , an internist , urged support for legislation that would increase the federal cigarette tax by 43 cents a pack to subsidize states' purchases of private insurance for children whose parents have no medical coverage but too much income to qualify for medicaid but senator arlen specter , republican of pennsylvania , told the committee that the legislation s authors senators orrin g hatch and edward m kennedy had blundered by including any tax at all in a bill mr specter said the atmosphere in the senate was so strongly against taxes that i frankly have doubts we could pass a bill to tax organized crime he suggested that health insurance for children who now have none be financed either from sales of the radio spectrum or by taking money from other domestic programs the hatchkennedy bill s cigarettetax increase , to 67 cents a pack from the current 24 cents , would be expected to raise 30 billion over five years of that , 20 billion would subsidize insurance for children of the working poor , and 10 billion would help cut the federal budget deficit testifying before the committee on friday , mr hatch , republican of utah , said that raising the federal tax on cigarettes was logical , because smoking causes illnesses that cost the government billions of dollars a year to treat and mr kennedy , the committee s ranking democrat , said as a practical matter , the tax is a user fee only those who smoke pay it , and it is a very small offset to the heavy costs that smoking imposes another potential problem for the legislation was raised when senator paul wellstone , democrat of minnesota , said he felt it was important to include coverage of mental as well as physical health in any plan dr dean , a democrat in his fourth term , noted that vermont raised its cigarette tax to 47 cents a pack in 1995 , from 23 cents , to finance an expansion of medicaid coverage for adults the state also includes all children whose families earn up to 225 percent of the poverty level , or 35 , 000 a year for a family of four
it will apparently take an act of god for the procter gamble company to kill persistent tales that its trademark and its executives are linked to satanism the stories have spread for more than 20 years , making procter gamble the object of boycotts and resulting in thousands of consumer inquiries about whether its executives worship the devil in the latest example of its protracted effort to fight back , the company is suing the amway corporation and 11 of its distributors , accusing them of making disparaging remarks about procter products and spreading the stories about satanism in an effort to lure customers to amway the suit accuses the defendants of unfair competition , fraud and violation of antiracketeering laws in response , amway says procter is simply bullying a growing competitor and has engaged in a false public relations campaign of its own still , procter s inability to end the stories underscores how difficult it can be for a company to protect its reputation , even if it is the world s largest consumer products company and has enormous marketing , advertising and legal resources and while the company has been unable to identify the original source of the tales , the aggressive approach it takes to try to squelch them may be part of the reason they persist why p g would choose to give this kind of rumor additional visibility is beyond me , said clive chajet , of chajet consultancy in new york , which advises companies on corporate and brand identity issues by not ignoring it , what they do is make more people aware of it but procter , a 35 billion company that takes as much care with its identity as it does with its soap advertising , says the tales , which first began to circulate in the early 1980 s , cannot simply be brushed aside we are just firmly committed to this , said elaine plummer , a spokeswoman for p g this involves our company s reputation and loss of business we know consumers around the world have been diverted from buying our products the stories typically contend that procter executives have appeared on talk shows to come out in support of satanism and that the moonandstars trademark of the company which is no longer used on its products contains the numbers 666 , which some people believe is a sign of the devil of course none of this is true , and the company has spent millions of dollars to try to convince the public of that yet consumer inquiries about 200 , 000 to date continue to pour in to the company s headquarters in cincinnati from as far away as africa and europe procter has enlisted any number of legal and marketing strategies to try to stop the spread of the stories company representatives have even shown up at churches to try to set the record straight , and the company once considered suing a group of nuns that it discovered had been circulating the misinformation to students through fliers we decided it was n't going to look good to start suing catholic nuns , said one person who worked on the matter for several years for the company the nuns eventually agreed to send new fliers home with their students correcting the earlier one , he said referring to the growing network through which the tales are spread from the informal grapevine to the internet this person said , it is more of a nuisance than a major league problem there was a period of time when we did n't file any lawsuits and the rumors seemed to ebb and flow , he continued it did seem to grow greater when it was ignored until the cold , hard reality of lawsuits got slapped on a few folks the company has , in fact , won several judgments against people found to have spread the stories in one case , a court ordered two amway distributors , a married couple from topeka , kan , to pay procter 75 , 000 in damages in all , the company has filed seven lawsuits against amway distributors over the years two of the suits name amway itself as a defendant amway , which is based in ada , mich , is a 68 billion directmarketing company whose products compete with procter brands , which include tide detergent and crest toothpaste the satanic message was disseminated by amway distributors again in 1995 on a massive scale in different forms and by different media , procter said in its latest complaint , filed in federal court in houston the complaint says amway representatives have told consumers that procter s products are harmful and ineffective for instance , it says distributors called tide an ineffective detergent that forms sludge that clogs drain pipes and causes washing machines to rust amway said in a statement , p g s recent lawsuit against amway corporation appears to be a reaction to an adverse decision in its earlier filed suit in utah in that case , amway said , a federal court this month dismissed an amended complaint by procter against amway and six of its distributors but other complaints are pending , including another case in utah that is expected to go to trial next year amway also said that the contentions that its distributors had made disparaging remarks about tide and other procter products stemmed from incidents that occurred years ago in those incidents , it said , distributors were told not to repeat such remarks about procter amway added that it had filed counterclaims accusing procter of abuse of the legal process and its publication of false and misleading press releases whether procter s latest lawsuit will be any more successful than past efforts to protect the ivorypure image that the company works so hard to project is an open question we 've been trying to get these deceptive practices to end for years , said ms plummer , the p g spokeswoman this case is the same in the sense that we want it to stop
a letter from the embassy of saudi arabia in washington regarding any information we might know of christian persecution in saudi arabia , the answer is none we have many foreign workers in the kingdom and they are treated as guests , and every consideration is given for their needs , as long as they abide by the shari'a law the letter was in answer to a new york times reporter s inquiry for a story on legislation before the city council of new york that would bar the city from doing business with companies operating in 15 countries named as persecuting christians the list includes china and other communist countries and saudi arabia and other muslim countries the assurance about foreign guests was printed on june 15 in an article about business opposition to the legislation so now some facts about religious worship in the kingdom such information is easy to find about any of the 15 about saudi arabia it is impossible to escape denial is a lie the shari'a is the holy law of islam , derived from the koran and mohammed s teachings the saudi section in the state department s most recent worldwide report on human rights , based on dispatches from us embassies , is a good place to find out how the law is seen and enforced by the royal government freedom of religion does not exist islam is the official religion and all citizens must be muslims the government prohibits the practice of other religions other information in the report for christians caught worshiping , punishment can be arrest and lashing wearing religious symbols is prohibited christians wearing a cross or engaging in any other religious practice can be arrested , flogged and deported conversion by muslims to another religion is considered apostasy apostasy is punishable by execution paul marshall , a specialist on persecution of christians , writes that occasionally citizens of important countries like britain or the us are allowed worship within embassy grounds , if they keep quiet about it amnesty international has documented about 350 cases of christian foreign workers arrested when they tried to worship in private , since church services are banned but arrests of christians from asia , the mideast and africa , which supply most of the kingdom s foreign workers , usually go unreported by their relatives and employers they fear the reprisals arrest and torture of the prisoners' families and , for americans who think saudi officials have any more respect for them than laborers from the third world us troops in saudi arabia during the gulf war were not allowed to wear any symbol of their faith since the war , religious oppression has increased saudi rulers are terrified that thoughts of religious freedom , or any other kind , linger from having had americans around to protect them from iraq american businessmen never worried about such saudi ways and morals nor do they now they do worry about the increasing american public revulsion against using government funds and contracts to enrich the persecutors nineteen cities and states are considering legislation to use local economic pressure against repression the opposition from business and persecutors will be stepped up in organization and funding the focus will be on new york city , and particular pressure on two men council speaker peter vallone , who introduced the legislation , and mayor rudolph giuliani , sympathetic but uncommitted , who will find it on his desk so it is increasingly critical for opponents of religious persecution to insist the evidence be spread out and denials examined instead of simply repeated and passed along the businessmen and their lobbyists , americans who attend saudi embassy parties or take those velvet trips to saudi arabia arranged by its officials they all know about the religious persecution perhaps like robert kiley , president of new york s chamber of commerce , they will say in public that local action against persecutions is just knownothingism cloaked in morality maybe some will even say that in private , to themselves and god , as they worship but it will be difficult , wo n't it , because we really do know , do n't we \?
on wednesday , harvey philip dale , a respected but not famous new york law professor , had lunch with two friends in midtown it was the day before everyone learned that he has had a secret life that involved giving away hundreds of millions of dollars of someone else s money after one of the friends left the table , mr dale told the other that in the morning , news reports would disclose that he has been the president since 1982 of an international philanthropy set up to quietly give away most of the wealth of his friend , charles f feeney unknown to almost everyone who knew him , mr dale has been playing in real life the role of the loyal aide who used to show up at needy people s doors to fulfill wealthy john beresford tipton s charitable intentions in the old television show the millionaire mr dale was not sure he would enjoy the attention that would come to him as the chief executive of one of the largest private philanthropies in the world , said peter swords , the friend who stayed at the table and heard about the philanthropy s decision to go public he said , in his mind , it was the right thing to do but in his heart he would miss being a private person , said mr swords , who is executive director of the nonprofit coordinating committee of new york people who know mr dale said yesterday that they understood his ambivalence about the newly public nature of his position several people involved in mr feeney s multibilliondollar philanthropy said yesterday that mr dale has been so involved in it from the start that the two men work almost as partners , even though the wealth came from mr feeney s business but they said that mr dale s role as the legal tactician who has implemented mr feeney s vision meant he had been especially comfortable out of the limelight mr dale declined to be interviewed harvey is tremendously committed to living an ideal and the ideal is craftsmanly excellence , said joel l fleishman , president of mr feeney s atlantic philanthropic service company , which provides staff and consulting services to mr feeney s charitable foundations at new york university law school and among lawyers who specialize in tax law and

is known as an influential lawyer on international tax questions and in recent years he has developed an expertise in legal concerns of philanthropic institutions there had long been a mystery about who mr dale s private law clients were and at the law school , there had been speculation for years about where the money came from for the wellfinanced national center on philanthropy and the law that mr dale runs at nyu at the law school , some faculty members had said they were uneasy that no one knew who mr dale s anonymous donor was some people also noted that because mr feeney s philanthropy is set up in bermuda , no one may ever learn about mr dale s compensation or other financial arrangements others at the law school said yesterday that mr dale seemed , for a professor , unusually at home in the world of high finance if you met him and were told he s the ceo of a major american corporation , you 'd believe it , said stephen gillers , who is also an nyu law professor but none of a dozen people interviewed who know mr dale yesterday said they ever suspected mr dale could be quietly running a philanthropy that had billions to give away some said they were surprised that someone with such power could live so quietly mr dale is divorced with two grown children , and lives in wooded bedford , ny friends say his private passions are tennis , mozart , and playing the piano and the flute mr dale first met mr feeney when he represented his business more than 30 years ago several people said yesterday that mr dale rarely mentioned his biggest client in retrospect , they said , he seemed to take his obligation to protect mr feeney s privacy so zealously that he may have all along felt he was protecting his own privacy yesterday , harvey j goldschmid , a law professor at columbia university who has known and worked with mr dale for years , received an earlymorning fax from mr dale mr goldschmid was the third person at the lunch who left before mr dale delivered his big news mr dale s fax included the philanthropy s press release describing the active part he has played in giving away mr feeney s millions now you can see why i 've been so secretive about what i do with a lot of my time , said a note to mr goldschmid mr goldschmid has served as a member of mr dale s board at the national center on philanthropy and the law he said that neither during board meetings nor during social gatherings or professional meetings had he ever had the slightest hint of the vast wealth mr dale was charged with giving away there was n't any hint before he

on a recent quiet weekday evening , chris o'neill stands on a small board while a boat pulls him calmly across cold spring harbor holding firmly to the tow rope handle , he suddenly turns towards the wake , flies 15 feet into the air and flips head over heels slamming hard into the water , as those on the boat erupt into loud hoots and hollers welcome to the world of wakeboarding just like mr o'neill , this new sport has made a splash here on long island a hybrid of waterskiing , wakeboarding combines the skills of surfing and snowboarding to produce gravitydefying stunts over the wakes made by highpowered boats it s really surfing behind a boat , said jeff barton , senior editor of launch wakeboarding magazine in san clemente , calif it was invented by the surfers out here who were looking for something to do on the days when the waves were down don pursel , one of the organizers of a local group of wakeboarders , is a selfprofessed action sports junkie , into anything that s new and happening besides wakeboarding , mr pursel enjoys surfing , sailboarding , snowboarding , kayaking and mountain biking , and sometimes he shows up to work at his store called the surf shop in huntington a grandfather of two , mr pursel usually runs with a younger crowd in pursuit of his pastimes i'm hanging out with kids , he said but i'm the one who gets these guys moving on this evening , mr pursel pilots his 21foot sea ray , named no return , around the harbor with some members of his newly formed wakeboarding club with mr o'neill clinging to his board about 100 yards behind , the boat loops around to pick him up when he falls , we usually just leave him there , said brian mclean , 32 , a remodeling contractor from centerport mr mclean started wakeboarding a year ago with his former neighbor , mr o'neill , 37 , a derivatives broker from northport , and they have been riding at least once a week ever since with injuries a risk in any sport , wakeboarders can claim their share , although the riders downplay the dangers a few of the pro wakeboarders are missing their front teeth because they bang their face into their knees , said mr pursel mr pursel drops off the spotter , ellie lockwood , and afirsttime wakeboarder , joe maehr , onto a 30foot sea ray anchored nearby before pulling along side of mr o'neill , who looks none the worse for wear , after floating on his back in his wetsuit and life vest for several minutes in the 62degree water never let them see you sweat , mr o'neill said , and grabbed onto the rope handle ready to go again the rider rises upright out of the water as mr pursel pushes the throttle up to 22 knots steering about 10feet wide at first , mr o'neill once again turns towards the wake this time he successfully executes a few airborn 180 s before launching high off the wake and then crashing into the water everyone on board ducks , as the tow rope slingshots through the boat , landing on a pile of wakeboards in the cabin the wakeboard is a fivefoot version of the modernday surfboard made of fiberglass and graphite , it is as thin as a water ski and is mounted with bindings to hold the rider s feet in place the newest advancement is its twintipped design , which allows the rider to move in either direction it s better than surfing you can do so much more , said john buckley of espo s surf and sport in east hampton a wave lasts for 35 seconds here you can go until you get tired it s an endless ride tommy bunger , of the bunger surf shop in babylon , said out in california it s big and it has finally filtered its way out here you can do some serious tricks i can see it replacing waterskiing it s going to take off mr o'neill said we waterskiied for a couple of months and tried wakeboarding on a whim we retired the skis and we have n't looked back with brand names like liquid force , full tilt and double up , wakeboards sell from about 250 to 750 a wetsuit and life vest \( and a boat \) are recommended accessories more than 13 million wakeboards were sold worldwide in 1996 , according to an industry source the growth curve of the sport has increased tremendously , said mr barton television exposure has really helped events on the world wakeboard tour have been televised on espn for the last two years , but the big boost came when the network included the sport in its 1996 x games competition we were noticing that wakeboarding was becoming one of the hottest sports , said ron semiao , director of programming for espn2 there was a tremendous response last year the gold medal was won by a 14yearold boy this year s x games will be held this week in san diego and will add a women s competition to the wakeboarding program , offering a total purse of 25 , 000 it s the board phenomenon that makes this go , said mr semiao boards are very cool whether you 're riding them on land , snow or water the tricks that you can do are very appealing to youth the sport has also developed its own language , used exclusively by the wakeboarding cognescenti tricks have names like tantrum and hootchie glide , and a ripper is a rider who does them well unfortunately the wakeboarders this evening

anyone who has logged many hours behind the wheel has most likely had to fight off drowsiness with stops for coffee , fresh air or something to eat but now auto makers are considering blowing a refreshing burst of peppermintscented air or lemon menthol to jolt you from your oncoming slumber they call it a drowsiness detection system , and auto makers and safety experts are seriously discussing putting versions of the system in dashboards in the next several years it is part of a series of emerging technologies intended to head off collisions the national highway traffic safety administration is betting that the drowsiness alert system will make a difference and is providing 16 million to develop the best product august burgett , a division chief at the agency , said such a device could prove to be an invaluable benefit , helping drivers avoid 11 million crashes a year if it was installed on all vehicles but he said it would not work unless it was affordable , reliable and not too invasive providing a spray to invigorate drivers , for example , may cause drivers to jerk , and swerve into an accident that the system is designed to help prevent siemens automotive , owned by the german industrial company , is working on a different approach for the truck market in europe , its research shows that 27 percent of all accidents involving trucks are caused by a driver s drowsiness the siemens system mounts a digital camera by the truck s reading light with a sensor to measure eyelid movements when blinking becomes infrequent , the information will be relayed to the truck s computer , which would send a warning to the driver there might be a beep , an instrumentpanel warning , vibration of the steering wheel or , in a dire situation , automatic braking the system would be offered as an option costing less than 200 , said andreas hirl , siemens s product manager for safety products , who called it a tremendous product that could make major inroads in avoiding crashes it could appear in trucks as early as 1999 in the united states , and later in passenger cars the trucking industry is looking at performancebased systems as well to identify sleepy drivers , including monitoring vehicles that begin to swerve out of their lanes in one scheme , a camera would be mounted on the outside of the truck aimed at the road ahead , which would detect whether the truck is weaving if so , an onboard computer would send a signal to the driver but brian o'neill , president of the insurance institute for highway safety in arlington , va , is skeptical he questions whether drivers need a device to tell them they are tired auto makers and suppliers are also studying drivers who drive too fast , and are testing a technology to keep quickly accelerating cars at bay called adaptive or intelligent cruise control , the system would use radar to scan a few hundred feet ahead and automatically slow down a quickly approaching car mercedesbenz expects to have the system on its cars by the 2000 model year , and bmw is on a similar track both companies were quick to embrace the new safety technologies and have already equipped some cars with parking aids that warn drivers , through sensors , if they are about to hit an obstacle the driver will still be in control , but the car can help to make sure nothing bad happens , said thomas zauber , a spokesman for bmw of north america but none of these technologies will go far if drivers do not like them and , for now , that is chrysler s concern we have a lot of reservations , said ivy renga , a manager of intelligent vehicle highway systems , who does not expect any of the systems to be reliable for at least 10 years his fear is that auto makers will be held liable if the devices fail beyond the technical issues is a more fundamental concern how much control do you take away from the driver \? clarence ditlow , executive director of the center for auto safety , said that is an element yet to be resolved , but he believes once consumers understand the warnings , electronics could provide big benefits in avoiding crashes the safety administration s burgett said his trial clinics indicate drivers will respond to systems if the message is presented properly and in a timely manner

washington , jan 3 hoping to quell the anger of some of america s strongest trading partners , president clinton said today that he intended to waive indefinitely part of a law that punishes foreign companies that use american property confiscated in cuba nearly 40 years ago the president said he did not want the furor that the law has set off in canada , mexico and europe to jeopardize what he described as an emerging international effort to isolate fidel castro and his communist government we must sustain our efforts to hasten the arrival of democracy in cuba , mr clinton said in a statement issued by the white house as he vacationed in the virgin islands as a result of increasing international pressure , we have never been closer to that day the decision today suspends for another six months the provision of the law that would allow united states citizens or corporations to sue any foreign company using confiscated american property in cuba mr clinton first suspended that provision in july after america s trading partners threatened to retaliate and mr clinton indicated that he would continue to suspend the provision every six months so long as america s friends and allies continue their steppedup efforts to advocate democratic changes in cuba although none have joined washington s 34year economic embargo of cuba , the president and his aides here pointed to several steps taken by those allies in recent months , including a vote by the european union last month urging mr castro s government to improve its record on human rights and political freedom with his decision , mr clinton appeared to be trying to strike a balance between the conflicting demands of republicans in congress and of trading partners abroad judging by today s reactions , he did not succeed representative dan burton , the indiana republican who sponsored the law with senator jesse helms of north carolina , condemned the president s action , saying mr clinton had decided once again to pass up a perfect opportunity to send a strong message to the castro dictatorship and to those who prop it up financially at the same time , officials in canada , mexico and europe remain critical of the helmsburton law the european union s envoy to the united states , hugo paemen of belgium , welcomed the decision to suspend the law s most onerous provision , but said that did not resolve the underlying problem with the law itself , which europeans say attempts to impose american foreign policy on other nations canada s international trade minister , arthur eggleton , accused the united states of continuing to hold this sword over the heads of other countries mexico was cautiously upbeat the mexican government recognizes that the decision of president clinton marks an effort to take into account the opinion of the international community , the foreign ministry said in a statement reported by reuters but the ministry added , the mexican government reaffirms the need to resolve any international differences via open and respectful dialogue , not via unilateral and confrontational methods for now , the president s decision appears to avert a trade showdown , including the possibility of titfortat legal retaliation from abroad canada and mexico have each passed legislation that would allow anyone punished by the american law to seek damages in their courts nor did the president s decision resolve legal challenges to the law still being pressed in the world trade organization and under the north american free trade agreement between the united states , canada and mexico the helmsburton act was passed by congress last march to discourage foreign investments in cuba and to promote democratic changes in addition to allowing the lawsuits , the law requires the state department to deny visas to the executives of foreign companies that use offices , factories or other properties once owned by americans but seized after the communist revolution that swept mr castro to power in 1959 mr clinton originally opposed the law , but he signed it after the outrage that erupted when cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes piloted by cubanamericans off cuba s coast last february he later suspended the provision allowing the lawsuits after america s allies warned of retaliation and officials within the administration began to fear a trade war in the middle of an election year , the president s maneuvering led to accusations that he was putting off a decision while trying to cultivate support of cubanamerican voters in florida and new jersey , states with important electoral votes in august the president appointed stuart e eizenstat , the undersecretary for international trade at the commerce department , as a special envoy to try to find common ground with the allies on other political and economic steps to isolate cuba at a news conference today , mr eizenstat said the controversy over the helmsburton act had focused the attention of european and other nations on democracy in cuba he noted that the european union s resolution last month for the first time linked economic relations with cuba to improvements in mr castro s policies on human rights while such efforts appear to have had little effect on mr castro s grip on power , mr eizenstat and other officials said they have had a punitive impact by isolating cuba politically and by discouraging foreign investors senator helms denounced mr clinton s decision as a terrible mistake in singling out mexico and canada for what he called shameful cuba policies , senator helms said i cannot understand why , just as we are beginning to make progress , the president has decided to give up the very leverage that brought such progress about mr clinton said the administration would continue to enforce other provisions of the helmsburton act , including the one denying visas to executives of foreign companies the state department has already imposed that punishment on a mexican telecommunications company , grupo domos , and a canadian mining concern , sherritt international mr eizenstat said today that 12 other companies were under investigation for violating the law on monday , he said , the united states notified bm group , an israeli company involved in sugar and citrus production in cuba , that its executives could face visa restrictions

endgame the betrayal and fall of srebrenica , europe s worst massacre since world war ii by david rohde maps 440 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 24 few people will enjoy this book it is a tale of ignominy , betrayal and slaughter it contains no heroes , only victims , butchers and a large cast of characters who , through sins of either commission or omission , bear some of the blame for the events it describes within this group , david rohde evidently believes , are you and i he may be right endgame is an account of the capture of the small bosnian town of srebrenica in july 1995 and the subsequent killing by the conquering serbs of around 7 , 000 of its people the massacre gnaws at the western conscience not just because of its coldbloodedness and size , but because in april 1993 srebrenica had become the first place in the world to be declared a safe area by the united nations indeed , in march of that year gen philippe morillon , the united nations commander in bosnia at the time , had gone to srebrenica and told its people you are now under the protection of the united nations i will never abandon you the task of protection , mr rohde explains , actually fell , in due course , to 750 lightly armed dutchmen although some acquitted themselves honorably in this unenviable role and one lost his life to a muslim hand grenade the dutch involvement as a whole was inglorious whether misjudging the nature of the serb attack or making appeals for help only to have them ignored , the dutch failed in their mission they ceded the southern half of the enclave they were meant to be defending without firing a shot some of the dutch troops were taken hostage others were humiliatingly obliged to acquiesce as the serbs arrested and led away the people in their charge one dutch lieutenant agreed to help the wouldbe murderers control their captives others were ordered to join the serbs in the sport of muslim hunting you shoot a muslim if you see them , they were told on one occasion , though they had found nine bodies and witnessed at least one execution , the dutch still forced muslim men to leave the united nations base perhaps understandably , the peacekeepers chose to volunteer very little of this after the event for its part , the dutch defense ministry accidentally destroyed the film of the nine bodies taken by one of its peacekeepers , strengthening speculation that it wanted to cover up the inadequacy of the netherlands' collective role in the affair yet , as mr rohde tells us , the people of srebrenica were not let down by the dutch alone all along the united nations chain of command lurked men with feet of clay , hearts of stone or heads of wood notable among them were yasushi akashi , the civilian head of the united nations mission in the former yugoslavia , who was terrified of challenging the serbs lest it compromise the united nations' impartiality , and lieut gen bernard janvier , his military counterpart , who repeatedly blocked the dutch peacekeepers' calls for nato air strikes when those strikes were eventually made , they proved highly effective , accurately hitting military targets with little collateral damage and dramatically cowing the serbs arguably , however , air strikes would never have been needed had the united nations' leading members been ready to send more troops in the first place boutros boutrosghali , the united nations secretary general , had asked for 34 , 000 peacekeepers to protect srebrenica and the five other safe areas in the event , he got 7 , 600 many outsiders , especially in the united states , have seen the war in bosnia as a straightforward example of serb aggression against innocent muslims the serbs were certainly aggressive , even genocidal , and the muslims were certainly their main victims but as this book makes clear , the srebrenica massacres were far from straightforward , and the part played by the bosnian muslims' leaders was even more shameful than that of their united nations protectors in their defense , it should be said that the muslims were demoralized and poorly armed indeed , in srebrenica and the other safe areas they had in theory \( though not in practice \) been completely disarmed by the united nations yet that does not fully explain why they surrendered srebrenica with scarcely any resistance their local military commander , naser oric , a 29yearold with apparently inspirational powers of leadership , played no part in the defense or evacuation of the town he was nowhere to be seen in the preceding years , however , he had been horribly evident , leading raids that were notorious for their brutality all told , his men had killed nearly 3 , 000 serbs in villages around srebrenica , conspicuously choosing the serbs' orthodox holidays on which to cut off heads or burn civilians in their homes his colleagues behaved little better srebrenica s leaders emerge from these pages richly endowed with human frailties hoarding food , black marketeering and , it seems , embezzling german marks sent by foreign charities for muslim orphans when danger threatened , they tried to inspire the townsfolk with promises of cash for any who would stay and fight , but the single piece of artillery they had concealed from the united nations was never fired \( the main attack involved only four serb tanks and a few hundred infantry \) hardly the spirit of thermopylae
to the editor re your aug 21 news article on efforts by senator mitch mcconnell to block restrictions on campaign donations before we can decide if we need campaign finance reform , we must dispense with figures that are irrelevant or misleading you cite the senator s claim that campaign spending is minuscule because it amounts to perhaps 1 percent of all television advertising and averages 389 per eligible congressional voter last year the price of a fastfood 'value meal , ' as he likes to put it these figures are disingenuous , not because there s anything wrong with the senator s math , but because he s making the wrong calculations i cannot imagine what calculating campaign spending as a percentage of overall television advertising is supposed to tell anyone i might as well calculate the cost of the apple i had for lunch as a percentage of the overall cost of advertising oranges throughout the country would n't it be far more relevant to calculate overall soft money campaign contributions as a percentage of the cost of running such campaigns \? that figure might tell people something useful about how beholden their elected representatives are to special interests likewise , expressing the billions of dollars spent last year on presidential and congressional races as 389 per voter encourages people to see such contributions in the wrong light true , if everyone gave that measly contribution , everyone would have the same clout in washington and the current system might actually be healthy for democracy , as the senator says but soft money is highly concentrated it comes from a few wealthy corporations and individuals who expect , and get , a lot more than the equivalent of a fastfood 'value meal' from the politicians they bankroll in truth , these contributions are more properly viewed as investments the few who can afford to make them are repaid with special favors like corporate welfare , lax industry regulations and special tax loopholes sometimes aimed at just one person none of senator mcconnell s figures give any indication of how much all these giveaways cost the average taxpaying citizen guy maxtonegraham los angeles , aug 21 , 1997
a 1996 law regulating the operation jetskis , waverunners , seadoos and other brands of personal watercraft went into effect last tuesday , causing confusion and anger among some operators , but mostly what one personal watercraft renter called a whole lot of nothing maira middleton , a coowner of the wally world boat rental company at bayview marina in ocean city , said the state police gave us a visit to make sure we knew about the law , but it was basically business as usual from a safety standpoint , i'm personally glad the law came out , and we 're playing it by the book , she added but it s been a hassle in ways none of us expected enacted in february 1996 to reduce injuries , fatalities and moving violations related to personal watercraft in new jersey waters , the law requires owners , who must be at least 16 , to take a coast guardapproved boating instruction course , pass a test and obtain safety certificates failure to have a certificate can result in fines of 100 to 300 levied on the owner as well as the operator of the craft the law was not fully enforced until tuesday to give owners of the estimated 19 , 000 personal watercraft registered in new jersey time to take the oneday , threetofivehour coast guardapproved boating safety course the course costs 15 to 50 the law exempts individuals who rent watercraft from taking the course instead , they must watch a safety videotape and are then given the rental company s certificate to use it also limits the areas where rental craft may be used and requires rental companies to monitor those areas this last requirement forced ms middleton to hire 14 monitors in april she said she was hoping not to pass the cost on to her rental customers , some of whom , she said , are confused because they think that if they want to spend an hour on the water , they have to pay to take a course and get a certificate she said renters were given a halfhour lesson before leaving the dock and a few outofstate personal watercraft owners are enraged by this , said ray leps , owner of all action water sports in marmora they come to the shore for a yearly vacation , and now they have to pay 30 to take a fourhour course before they can get into the water if they can find a course to get into it s like forcing me , a guy who lives in new jersey and has a new jersey driver s license , to get a georgia driver s license if i want to drive through georgia who wants that kind of hassle \? another problem , mr leps said , is that the law confines renters to specific areas , while owners are free to go where they please in navigable waters for a year and a half , he said , his sales of watercraft , which range from 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 , have gone down by 30 percent they 're trying to kill the sport , he said state police trooper jeffrey andres said the law had already reduced the number of reported accidents only 8 to 10 percent of registered craft in the state are personal watercraft , but they accounted for 40 percent of the boating accidents in 1995 , he said in 1996 , they accounted for 30 percent of the accidents we attribute this to increased education on the part of the operators due to the law three deaths from watercraft accidents were reported in 1996 , up from one in 1995 and on june 15 , on the tuckahoe river in cape may county , christopher dawson , 20 , of bridgeton died in the hospital after his personal watercraft was hit by a watercraft operated by steven burt , 17 , of newport both had boating safety certificates still , tom innocent , a former state police sergeant who now owns beesleys point seadoo in beesleys point , supports the law enough people are aware that it s really about safety and responsibility , he said my customers have n't complained he acknowledged that rentals were down this year there s no question about that , he said but the weather s been off until the last week or so , so it s tough to say if the law will have a negative effect on business photo pete lambert , 18 , of oceanview riding the waves in a restricted area off beesleys point in cape may county \( allen oliver for the new york times \)
investigators searching for the cause of a subway derailment in harlem will begin interviewing the train s motorman and conductor and other transit workers tomorrow , but their focus remained on a switch where the rear wheels of the last car of an eightcar train jumped the tracks , officials said yesterday with all wreckage cleared from the 135th street station , where the derailment occurred on thursday night , and with full service restored on a , b , c and d trains , investigators reported no immediate breakthroughs in an inquiry that might take weeks or months the investigators took a holiday weekend break yesterday and said they would resume tomorrow with the employee interviews and a further examination of the wreckage , which was cut into chunks on friday and hauled to a maintenance shed at 207th street in the bronx mark garcia , the lead investigator for the national transportation safety board , went home to atlanta , but will return to new york late tomorrow , said matthew furman , a board spokesman joseph hoffman , the senior vice president of the transit authority in charge of subways and the local investigation , also took a break , said charles seaton , a spokesman for the authority two days after the derailment , investigators said they had a fairly clear idea of what happened , but not why just after 10 pm , the southbound a express , with 100 riders aboard , was supposed to pass through the station at 135th street and st nicholas avenue , without stopping it was traveling at a normal speed , 25 to 30 miles per hour seven of its eight 75foot cars rolled smoothly over the switch just north of the station that is sometimes used to shunt cars temporarily onto a spur , or siding , between the local and express tracks but the last set of wheels of the eighth car , for reasons that are not known , veered onto the spur track at the switch point with the head of the car on the express tracks and the rear on the spur line , the rear wheels quickly jumped the tracks and the car slammed sideways into a cement wall that divides the express and spur tracks the car also hit two steel support columns there was no extensive track damage , and the switch , to the surprise of some investigators , also appeared to be undamaged but the silvery , 40ton subway car broke diagonally into two sections , a 60foot forward part and a 15foot trailing segment , and was reduced to mangled hulks of twisted metal , sheared cables and shattered glass of the 100 people on board , none were in the car that was wrecked only 15 people were hurt most were treated at the scene for cuts and bruises two passengers a 23yearold man with a neck injury and a 40yearold woman with lacerations of the legs and arms remained in stable condition yesterday at harlem hospital center investigators worked at the scene all day friday while crews with acetylene torches cut the wrecked car into sections for removal to the bronx working in 100degree heat and blowtorch fumes that forced them to take breaks , the crews also examined tracks , ties , signals , switches and other equipment with the wreckage removed by 7 45 pm on friday , the transit authority reopened the station officials said the investigators had gathered extensive information from the wrecked car , an r44 model built in 1972 by the st louis car company , and they focused on the switch as the point at which the derailment apparently began but it was unclear if the switch , the wheels or the undercarriage might have been at fault , or whether other factors something on the tracks , for example had caused the derailment , officials said while no causes were being ruled out , investigators appeared to be leaning toward mechanical failure the motorman and conductor underwent drug and alcohol tests , and the results were pending
after two years of criticism from federal environmental officials , gov george e pataki has announced plans to strengthen new york state s enforcement of environmental laws , particularly those limiting air pollution from large sources like factories and power plants the biggest shift would be an increase in inspections for pollution problems and a new emphasis on pursuing the worst violators those two factors were identified by the federal environmental protection agency as particularly weak in new york state last year senior epa officials said mr pataki s planned changes could end a long decline in environmental enforcement in new york that began late in the administration of gov mario m cuomo and worsened under mr pataki some private environmental groups and political opponents were less optimistic a low point was reached last year , according to the epa s continuing analysis of the state s programs the federal analysis concluded that fines were consistently too low , inspections were far too few , and the pursuit of big companies discharging hundreds of tons of pollutants into the air was minimal federal officials are particularly concerned with improving pollution programs in the state because the air in and around new york city fails to meet federal clean air act standards and because the state sets an influential example for other states , said several federal environmental officials , who spoke only on condition of anonymity by increasing the interaction between state regulators and regulated businesses , the improvements as announced would be likely to identify problems before they damage the environment , federal officials said the changes in state programs were announced on thursday by john p cahill , new york s acting environmental conservation commissioner mr cahill said that under a 400 , 000 amendment to mr pataki s budget , 15 positions would be added to state pollution inspection and enforcement teams six positions would be in new roaming teams of specialists looking for air or water pollution at the state s largest industrial sites or at plants with particularly poor environmental records in a move eagerly sought by the epa , mr cahill also said that mr pataki would oppose any legislation allowing companies to keep private the results of internal audits that reveal pollution dozens of states have recently passed that kind of law proponents say they encourage companies to police themselves by freeing them of the threat of public disclosure the epa has argued , however , that the laws could prevent prompt disclosure of threats to public health mr cahill also announced stricter limits for a program championed by his predecessor , michael d zagata , that offered polluters the chance to make taxdeductible contributions to local environmental projects in lieu of paying steeper fines representatives of the state s business community said that in general , they were not surprised by the proposals and that the changes in their own procedures would not be unduly expensive enforcement is an area where the administration was criticized a lot , said kenneth pokalsky , an environmental specialist at the business council of new york state , a trade group that has worked closely with the pataki administration on regulation it was expected that they would have to do something about it the changes could transform new york from a laggard on preventing pollution into a national leader , jeanne m fox , the regional administrator of the epa , said in manhattan commissioner cahill and the governor should be commended , said ms fox , adding that new york s actions could influence other states that had been weakening environmental enforcement some new york legislators and private environmental groups were not so quick to approve , saying that during mr pataki s administration the ability of the state environmental agency to seek out and punish polluters had been so greatly weakened that the changes were relatively insignificant even with the creation of the new inspection and enforcement positions , the total number of state workers enforcing environmental laws would still be lower this year than when mr pataki took office in 1995 , said richard l brodsky , a westchester democrat who is the chairman of the state assembly s environmental conservation committee before mr pataki took office , there were 530 enforcement workers in the environmental agency , but the governor has trimmed that number to 460 , mr brodsky said in his office in elmsford , ny beyond the staff changes , mr brodsky said , there was a clear shift in the culture of enforcement at the agency under mr pataki , adding that inspectors had become less apt to recommend a penalty citing statistics he received from mr pataki s office yesterday , mr brodsky noted that environmental cases referred for enforcement had dropped to 541 in fiscal year 199596 , from 1 , 544 in fiscal 199394 he said that mr cahill s announcement was welcome , but was just a beginning they 're finally reversing the skid , mr brodsky said but staffing is still down from where it used to be and where it ought to be mr cahill said the staff size and effectiveness were different issues the new positions , he said , would shift the agency s focus more toward finding problems and solutions out in the field , rather than on building legal cases back in albany all along , mr pataki and his environmental staff have said that a drop in the annual tally of pollution penalties or other actions did not necessarily mean that the environment was suffering it could also mean that industries were complying more , they have said but in a series of meetings with pataki officials last year , the epa said that inspections of factories and other sources of pollution in new york state had fallen off so much that it was hard to gauge whether the drop in punitive actions resulted from lax enforcement or simply less pollution you need to be out there doing inspections to help companies avoid violations , ms fox said in a detailed review of the state s enforcement efforts begun last year , epa officials noted many areas where they said the state was doing a poor job inspections of factories , power plants , or other businesses emitting toxic compounds into the air dropped to 309 in 1996 , from more than 600 a year in 1991 and 1992 , according to the epa review but the most important , persistent lapse noted by federal regulators was the lack of action against air pollution by new york s largest companies , some of which have plants that emit hundreds or thousands of tons of toxic compounds a year those cases are called significant violators by the epa in the 199596 fiscal year , a minimal number of significant violators were identified by the state environmental conservation department , according to a letter last year to state officials from the regional office of the epa and for many years in new york , even when cases were identified , months often went by before action was taken , far exceeding federal guidelines according to the epa report , only 11 percent of largescale pollution cases in new york state were pursued with adequate speed in 1993 , only 2 percent in 1994 , and none in 1995 and 1996 the result , the report said , was that many old significant violators continue to not be addressed and are carried over from year to year the situation was so bad last july that the epa threatened to take over the pursuit of this type of case unless the state improved its enforcement

isfahan , iran isfahan , wrote jean chardin , the 17thcentury french traveler , was expressly made for the delights of love with its richly decorated domes and lush gardens , the royal city is a sensual delight , a place where shifting light and shadow caress the turquoiseandcreamcolored tiles of the mosques and where long arcades and soaring vaults spellbind even the most jaded tourist it is the splendor of persian treasures like isfahan , 200 miles south of teheran , that iran has begun to use to lure foreign tourists as part of its campaign , iran announced last august that it would issue visas within 24 hours to foreigners seeking to visit the country even americans , with a bit of persistence and pull , can get a visa within two weeks , although the state department s official warning on iran urges americans to stay out because of the generally antiamerican atmosphere and iranian government hostility to the us government but nearly a generation after the ayatollahs seized the palaces of kings , iran is still locked in a fierce and bitter struggle over how hospitable it should be to the nonmuslim world ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , the revolution s late spiritual leader , used to rant about the western sickness among us but the reality is that in a country with raging inflation , 20 percent unemployment and little foreign investment , hard currency counts and tourists from places like germany and japan spend more than twice as much money as devout pilgrims from other islamic countries with rulings that ban alcohol , forbid any display of affection among nonmarried couples and require women to cover their heads with scarves and wear clothing that hides the curves of their bodies , it is not all that easy being a tourist in iran i'm incredibly hot , complained one middleaged female british teacher dressed in a flowered kerchief and long wool coat , who was part of an organized group of british high school students touring isfahan our guide keeps telling me to pull my scarf down over my hair , and i keep pushing it back another obviously foreign female visitor who tried to check into a hotel with a man who was not her spouse \( separate rooms

sleepy afternoon in teheran was to lunch at leon s the upscale russian restaurant in the heart of the capital that served double orders of rich beluga on paperthin blinis accompanied by a bottle of russian vodka encased in ice but leon s closed soon after the government turned islamic and since then , iran s caviar market has been rocked by pollution , corruption and the disintegration of the soviet union poachers in the four former soviet republics bordering the caspian sea that produce 90 percent of the world s black caviar are both overfishing the sturgeon and saturating the market with caviar of questionable quality to make matters worse for iran , the caspian sea has been rising for more than a decade , submerging hatcheries and blocking the sturgeons' spawning areas since iran exports most of its caviar for hard currency , there is none in the markets of teheran these days and few of the better hotels and restaurants that list caviar on their menus actually stock it this scarcity has created a cottage industry for middlemen , who turn up at embassies and businesses with sacks full of contraband smallgrained sevruga , at considerable risk , for as little as 80 a pound caviar , said a food dealer in one market , is more dangerous to sell than heroin one european ambassador acknowledges that he sometimes expedites tourist visa requests for his caviar vendor and his family he gets the papers he needs from the embassy , the ambassador said we get the caviar uncle sam slips through the hunger in iran for things western , particularly american , seems insatiable from books and videos to clothing and foodstuffs the clinton administration s economic embargo against iran has not made american goods disappear , just made them more expensive under iranian customs regulations , iranians entering the country are allowed to bring in one appliance , which has led to a lively importation of items like refrigerators in a country where a midranking civil servant s salary is less than 200 a month , a 27cubicfoot general electric refrigerator costs more than 5 , 000 , a slightly used general electric washing machine about 1 , 200 in the behjeatabad indoor food

parliamentary elections , the government has tightened restrictions on the media and book publishing , intensified its confiscation of illegal satellite dishes and pressured artists and writers with arrests and ominous denunciations on television the system is still loose enough that iranians routinely hold parties where women wear no veils and armenianmade vodka flows freely but many outspoken iranians who have felt a layer of protection under the anarchy that has pervaded the country since the revolution suddenly have begun to ask foreign visitors not to call them at home even diplomats

what it comes down to is , they are friends they were friends as kids playing roller hockey between sewer covers , they were friends as young men fighting for their country , they were friends when spouses and careers intervened , and they are friends now , in the ripeness and whimsy of old age in these querulous times when the world seems to turn much too quickly , when yesterday s intimates are barely today s memories , they have stood fast they have not only insisted on friendship , they have defined it they have taken friendship and gone the distance with it there s nothing we would n't do for each other , frank levy said of 60 years of communing with the others we 're friends it s that simple , and it s that complicated no one suggests they have done something extraordinary , though it often seems less and less ordinary simply , they found people they liked when they were barely teenagers and they have not stopped liking them and they have not stopped seeing one another , however many obstacles the world puts in their way which explains why this group of men in their 70 s , on the 60th anniversary of their relationship , got together recently to mark their friendship in a special way while they have now fanned out from new york , in the beginning , the salient factor was geography there were 18 of them who lived on the upper west side , mainly in the 80 s along west end avenue , then a solid workingclass and middleclass neighborhood like many other west side boys , they formed a club , in 1937 no gang here getting its titillations from theft and gunfire \( sure , they had their fights , though strictly with their fists \) , for this was a sports and fraternal club they named it the century athletic club they competed in baseball and football and roller hockey against rivals like the cobras , the nordacs , the dukes and the riverside cardinals they played stickball and stoopball and box ball their selfproclaimed clubhouse was schor s candy store on broadway and 83d \( you got whacked on the head with a puck , you went to schor s and the owner applied a frozen malted to the lump \) members wore blackandgold jackets and had a key signifying membership the idea was to give the key to your girlfriend and then retrieve it if you were lucky when affections changed focus weekly meetings were held at 9 pm on fridays at a member s apartment enter after 9 , and you got slapped with a 5cent fine show up without a suit jacket and that was a nickel , too leave before a meeting was adjourned \( poker followed , so who would \?

cracow , poland few issues are as politically delicate in poland as abortion , so when a distinguished writer wrote an impassioned short story that criticized the pope s abortion stance , it was bound to cause a stir the writer , gustaw herling , like pope john paul ii , is a fierce anticommunist during a visit to his homeland that coincided with the pope s recent tour , mr herling , 78 , said he had been taken aback , although pleased , at the strength of the polish reaction to his story i 've had phone calls from church people who agree with me but are not prepared to go public , mr herling said as he relaxed in the highceilinged , booklined apartment of a friend here the story has divided people in the church into two camps called beata santa , the story is indeed provocative mr herling s heroine , marianne k , is a polish teenager who goes to stay with relatives in bosnia and is there during the war she is detained by bosnian serbs , along with many other women , in a prison camp , and like the other women prisoners , raped many times by her captors once they are freed , most of the women arrange for abortions if they have become pregnant but marianne is devoted to the church and in particular to this pope so she follows the pope s edict , issued during the bosnian war , that imprisoned women who are victims of rape should give birth and love their children in mr herling s story , marianne dies after delivering a healthy baby written by almost any other polish author , the story might have been dismissed as a piece of overwrought melodrama or an anticlerical pamphlet but mr herling , whose work was banned by the polish communists and who has lived in italy for 40 years , carries considerable moral authority both at home and abroad his autobiographical novel , a world apart , about his experiences in the soviet gulag , was hailed by the british philosopher bertrand russell when it appeared in 1951 it has been compared to the work of primo levi , a holocaust survivor who wrote of his experiences mr herling s novellas , works of criticism and essays appeared regularly in kultura , the parisbased polish cultural magazine that flourished during the communist period in a way , beata santa is of a piece with much of mr herling s past work , which is threaded with themes of persistence of life in the face of pain and extreme solitude i was provoked by a man whom i admire very much , john paul ii , he said but he made an appeal to young girls who have been raped in bosnia not to have an abortion i thought it was very unjust terrible i'm not for abortion , but how can a young girl love a child out of such a situation \? it s inconceivable mr herling has been attacked by some church people doubly upset that the protagonist is polish who assert the story is overblown of course it s not a true story but it s not exaggerated , he said it s part true , part invented i know the situation of the young girls who were raped i made the heroine polish because it is easier for me to tell the story that way soon after the communists collapsed , the roman catholic church in poland pushed very hard for a strict abortion law , which was passed during the presidency of lech walesa the current president , aleksander kwasniewski , signed a more liberal law , but it was overturned by the constitutional court in may mr herling , grayhaired and with a faintly tanned face from his life in naples , where he lives with his italianborn wife , lidia , has some traits in common with the pope , who is 77 they were both born in the fiercely proud postworld war i period in poland mr herling in the central town of kielce both have spoken and written against the communists during world war ii , the pope toiled in a factory in germanoccupied cracow mr herling was deported from eastern poland to siberia by the soviets in 1940 , an experience that formed the basis for his first book but , mr herling pointedly said , there are some things i do n't share mr herling said he is unhappy because he believes that the pope s stance on abortion harms the church i'm against abortion , but under the conditions of allowing contraception , he said the pope is doing damage to christianity in everyday life because this stand on abortion makes people hypocritical this is the third trip back to poland since the fall of the communists for mr herling , who still writes in polish each time , he said , he falls in love again with the soft light , pale sky and wild gardens that contrast with the harsher tones of naples he said that on this visit he noticed a marked growth in prosperity from his last visit three years ago , but he says the country is not producing much interesting writing he is distinctly unimpressed with the political scene , a judgment that reflects his distaste for the former communists who are now in power they are not 'former' this is nonsense , he said abruptly then , with great relish , he described the meeting this year in rome between the pope and president kwasniewski an encounter the vatican had put off for as long as possible , apparently because of the pope s distaste for the former communist at the first moment , the pope was very angry , mr herling said , describing the meeting , which he watched on television he had the face of a man saying 'go away , what do you want from me' after 40 minutes they came out and probably the president gave some assurances because the pope looked a little better mr herling s beata santa story touched such a nerve that it has been translated into four other languages he has had inquiries from film makers but none of the reactions have been as touching to him as that of a polish couple living in switzerland who wanted to know in which cemetery his character , marianne , was buried they wanted to place flowers on her grave , he said photo gustaw herling , an expatriate polish author , has written a piece of fiction that has apparently divided the polish church over the question of abortion in cases of rape it tells of a polish woman raped by soldiers \( michael dean for the new york times \)
big tobacco has gotten away with murder for years and may yet again if we do n't scrutinize every term of its latest surrender but what s even more appalling is that its executives get away with lying under oath last week marked the third anniversary of that incredible tv moment the zapruder film of the cigarette wars in which top executives of the seven leading tobacco companies raised their right hands before congress and god and then swore that they did n't believe cigarettes to be addictive such swaggering corporate arrogance which brought no punishment to any of the odious seven may pollute the moral atmosphere of the country as much as secondhand smoke poisons any lungs and it continues right now , even as big tobacco supposedly capitulates to its antagonists in a scoop on sunday , the miami herald published transcripts of sworn depositions taken from tobacco executives 10 days ago in a classaction suit against their industry andrew schindler , president of r j reynolds , testified that cigarettes are no more addictive than coffee or carrots alexander spears , chairman of lorillard , said under oath that he did n't think americans die of diseases caused by cigarette smoking mr spears is the same man who three years ago presented congress with a chart showing that nicotine levels in cigarettes had dropped 10 percent since 1982 it later turned out that nicotine levels had in fact risen by 10 percentplus of all the lies , though , the most galling are those involving children if american adults want to smoke , that s their business i was a smoker myself what makes big tobacco criminal is its targeting of young customers to replace the cancernailed old ones and its lying as it asks us to believe that it s doing nothing of the sort despite joe camel and all the logoladen gear promoting the marlboro man despite the voluminous studies showing that this advertising correlates directly to the recent steep rise in teenage smoking big tobacco still maintains it is n't pursuing kids only last november a spokesman for r j reynolds , perpetrator of joe camel , declared that obviously we would never do anything that would appeal to younger smokers obviously ! whatever deal it makes , big tobacco will continue to target children , even if with more covert marketing \( internet games instead of cartoons \) as elizabeth whelan writes in a compelling critique of the current negotiations to be published next week by her organization , the american council on science and health , the cigarette industry is no stranger to crisis , and it excels at making lemonade from every lemon thrown at it what s more , big tobacco s ability to lie to the public without consequences emboldens other corporations to do the same anheuserbusch , which seduces potential young drinkers with its own answer to joe camel , budweiser frogs , now just follows the cigarette purveyors' script we do not target our advertising toward young people , period , its spokesman said this month even as research on the bud campaign by the center on alcohol advertising shows that the beer mascot is now better known to children aged 9 to 11 than smokey bear exactly like big tobacco , big alcohol says its ads are designed only to inspire brand loyalty among adults \( sometimes big alcohol is big tobacco miller beer is a division of philip morris \) both industries also disingenuously purport that young people ca n't get their product anyway never mind that half of american high school seniors use alcohol and that it is fueling the leading cause of teenage death , car accidents since nothing else has worked , and none of these corporations appear to have any shame , maybe it s time for the law to hold their executives to account for their sworn statements , which often are in direct contradiction not only of scientific fact but of internal documents now being revealed from their own company vaults if that fails , we may have to rely on divine intervention last friday , only four days after he testified under oath in florida that nicotine is not addictive , mr schindler of r j reynolds lost his north carolina vacation home to a fire that caused 1 million in damage suspected cause a construction worker s careless toss of a lighted cigarette butt
when new york state announced last month that it had negotiated a 125 billion federal aid package to help its hospitals and clinics make the adjustment to managed care , critics said an industry with intimate connections to the highest levels of state and local politics was being coddled once again in many ways , however , the aid package does not tell the story of a marriage , but of a breakup economists and health care experts say it reveals the cracks in an industry that is being forced to give up its decadeslong dependence on planned , predictable , governmentcoordinated growth the transition money , intended as a bridge into a new era of health care , will also hasten that transition , the experts say , undermining the old stability even as it clears the way for innovation new york medicine has often been compared to the subsidydrenched agriculture industry just as farmers are paid not to grow certain crops , medical schools in new york are paid not to train new doctors , to stave off a glut a stark example of the industry s disconnection from market forces is the recession of the early 1990 s as much of the rest of the state s economy wilted , health care particularly in new york city was the only major industry to add jobs but the old system has had a tough time as big government s role has shrunk in agribusiness , the retreat of subsidies has prompted farmers to experiment cotton farmers have planted corn and wildrice growers have tried cranberries in new york , the medicaid adventure is likely to produce unforeseen spinoffs and experiments , too as well as some dead ends health experts and economists say the expected consequences of the medicaid agreement are profound enough it will shift 16 million people into managed care over the next three years , making it the largest such experiment in the nation health experts say that local neighborhood doctors' offices should increase in number as managed care takes hold , and that the job mix of the health industry will change there will be fewer lowskilled workers in fields like hospital food service and more computer workers handling claims for healthmaintenance organizations the stakes are enormous new york takes in nearly onesixth of the entire federal medicaid budget and educates one in five of the nation s doctors and dentists across the state in 1996 , more than 1 in 11 jobs was in private health care , according to the federal bureau of labor statistics a study by the federal reserve bank of new york in 1995 said that the new york metropolitan region had a higher dependence on health care business about one in eight jobs than boston , chicago , houston or los angeles statewide , the health care system was by far the largest employer last year , with 741 , 000 employees of private businesses alone jarring changes certainly have been occurring in new york health care for years , as hospital consolidations , costcutting pressures and a competitive price setting structure for hospitals established earlier this year have shaken many of the old patterns the medicaid agreement is expected to accelerate the pace of change sharply this is partly because it is in the care of the poor that new york has been most generous to hospitals , and because a huge new enrollment in managed care will greatly expand the power of the managed care companies to press doctors and hospitals to cut costs health care economists say managed care commonly moves the location of treatment away from hospitals and hospitalbased clinics to local doctors' offices the 125 billion in transition money is directly aimed at helping hospitals establish those offsite offices and train people to work in them but james r tallon jr , the president of the united hospital fund , a 118yearold research and philanthropic organization , said that local neighborhood medical care had never been a tradition in new york , especially in poor areas for generations , beginning well before the social programs of the new deal , health care for the indigent in new york has been based around institutions rather than doctors , mr tallon said when medicaid was created , it solidified and codified a hospitalbased system that was already deeply embedded how the essentially suburbanbred system of managed care is to be grafted onto those old systems and traditions will be an exploration in itself , mr tallon said new york s next recession is also likely to be different in the new era whenever the next downturn occurs , and whatever its severity , the health care industry s stalwart stability of years past may not be as bankable as it once was is health care still the ace in the hole for new york \? said howard s berliner , a professor of health policy at the new school for social research the answer , i think , is probably not professor berliner said the main economic effect of medicaid s shift to managed care would be felt in the job market health care will still be a large employer with a large economic presence , he said , but as a mass employer of people on the lower economic rungs lowwage , lowskill workers in 24hour hospitals its best days are probably already a memory demand for such workers , professor berliner said , will decline along with the length of hospital stays and the shift to outpatient treatment jobs under managed care generally require better education and communication skills , he said
back when the recording industry was young , short works for violin along with arias from the great operas proved perfect vehicles for transporting the sounds of the concert hall into people s homes they worked so well because a 78rpm disk could accommodate only a few minutes of music on a side and because the frequency range of the violin \( like that of the voice \) translated well to shellac in later years , when those concerns were no longer relevant , short works by pablo de sarasate , fritz kreisler , dvorak and tchaikovsky still filled record catalogues the explanation is simple artists like yehudi menuhin , mischa elman , zino francescatti and , of course , kreisler were fond of them the public , too , was captivated by the romantic sweep of these works the technical derringdo , flights of fancy and gypsy rhythms proved irresistible to call this music light is not to say that it lacks merit dvorak s humoreske can bring an unforced tear to the eye as quickly as a chopin nocturne or a wolf song some critics argue that string players today have lost the lilt that is vital in such music yet plenty of performers continue to record it now three cd s have appeared , hoping to enrich this longstanding musical tradition none will displace the multitude of kreisler , menuhin or elman reissues already available on cd for some things , there is just no substitute yet new approaches can make listeners hear music differently or with renewed interest , and that is no mean achievement the young violinist gil shaham seems an obvious choice in such material natural elegance and a pleasing , wellbalanced tone are hallmarks of his playing his recent deutsche grammophon recordings of more serious repertory , concertos by korngold , barber and prokofiev , show a real affinity for music in which the deft gesture is allimportant mr shaham s romance \( deutsche grammophon 449 9232 \) supplies a healthy repast of 10 violin bonbons , though hardly a lavish one , at 58 minutes given the wealth of available material , one wishes that mr shaham had produced a fuller cd , but his shimmering playing almost makes up for the parsimony although a lone pianist typically completes the picture in such repertory , mr shaham carries the orpheus chamber orchestra in tow the result conjures up palm courts , tearooms and lazy afternoons almost of necessity , mr shaham includes three kreisler gems indeed , what collection of short works for violin would be complete without schon rosmarin , liebesfreud and liebesleid \? mr shaham lends characteristic warmth to each of them , even if he never quite makes the works his own tchaikovsky s dreamy serenade melancolique and dvorak s sentimental romance in f minor receive touching , highly personalized readings here but in sarasate s romanza andaluza , more aggressive bowing is needed to convey the work s sultry charms in a misguided programming move , the cd features beethoven s two violin romances , which seem staid in this company what s more , thin support from orpheus ill serves these works , which require a solid partnership between soloist and ensemble mr shaham s contribution , though , is above reproach , combining superb technique with unforced musicality virtuoso violin \( bmg classics 09026684142 \) , lorin maazel s new foray into the realm of salon music , may strike some as odd since when do worldfamous maestros fiddle around \? they do n't , usually , for few of them are formally trained violinists training aside , however , mr maazel is not a regularly performing violinist here , his tone can sound reedy , his intonation wobbly yet it is astonishing that having spent almost 60 years pursuing a career on the podium , he can play as well as he does mr maazel wisely begins with five gershwin tunes from porgy and bess , where jazzy inflection can mask some of his technical shortcomings but in more typical light fare godowsky s alt wien , the meditation from massenet s thais and dvorak s slavonic dance no 2 , for instance his generally warmhearted phrasing cannot conceal a grating shrillness two of those compulsory kreisler tunes merely hint at their inherent charm in mr maazel s performances schon rosmarin is taken too fast to be savored , and liebesleid lacks that essential , twinkling quality best dubbed schwung occasionally , the violinist s squeaky sound can summon a cherished memory , as with his rendition of the andante cantabile from tchaikovsky s string quartet in d , which recalls the budapest string quartet of long , long ago throughout his 66minute recital , mr maazel is accompanied adequately , if not memorably , by the pianist barton weber the violin is not the only instrument on which such short works may bloom several violists have transcribed famous violin pieces for their own use over the years on her newest record , viola bouquet \( philips 446 1032 \) , nobuko imai follows a lead established by notable predecessors , including lionel tertis and william primrose ms imai s generous cd , which runs more than 77 minutes , embraces a wide range of music and reveals how well suited the mellower viola is to much of this repertory with a voice situated between the copper glow of the cello and the golden brilliance of the violin , the viola lends that omnipresent trio of kreisler items a slightly different spin ms imai takes them at a relaxed pace and imbues them with unusual dignity yes , some of the music s spontaneity disappears , but her seriousness brings its own rewards the disk is rife with familiar material , but the lesserknown works , by tamezo narita , zoltan kodaly and henry eccles , may be more interesting the most substantial in every sense are two pieces by kodaly his thrilling arrangement of bach s chromatic fantasy \( bwv 903 , without the fugue \) , which ms imai plays with unyielding concentration and without accompaniment , and his youthful , meditative adagio the pianist roland pontinen offers expert support on the disk his robust playing never steals the spotlight from ms imai , yet neither does he emerge faceless , like so many of his peers the violin , yehudi menuhin noted in a recent conversation , is the worsttaught instrument i know he lauded the progress many have made in mastering the instrument s technical hurdles but expressed great disappointment over one shortcoming what players today lack is a sense of style , he said mr menuhin was lamenting the absence of a musical signature , some unmistakable indication that a particular artist is performing mr shaham , mr maazel and ms imai are talented musicians whose new recordings make us appreciate once more the special charms unique to miniatures played on string instruments but even at their best , these musicians remind us mostly of the vanished days when a gracefully turned phrase and more than a bit of vibrato instantly signaled a beloved artist it was a time when giants named huberman and heifetz and elman and kreisler took listeners' breath away photo gil shaham warmth and unforced musicality in works by kreisler and others \( christian steiner deutsche grammophon \)
atlanta , jan 16 two bomb explosions , apparently timed to go off about an hour apart , damaged a suburban atlanta abortion clinic this morning and injured six people , including investigators and news reporters who were drawn to the first blast no one was hurt when the first explosion , at about 9 30 am , shattered glass , brought down parts of walls and ceilings , and caused a small fire that was quickly extinguished at a threestory office building , which houses an abortion clinic on the ground floor then , as firefighters and investigators from several agencies combed the scene and television news crews did live coverage in the adjoining parking lot , a second bomb hidden either in a trash bin or nearby car exploded , knocking people to the ground and bloodying at least two of them the blasts dismayed some abortion rights advocates , who had hoped that a slight decline in violence against abortion clinic , confirmed in figures disclosed today , had meant that the two sides would find more common group the early blast today , on the first floor , terrified office workers and sent them running for the exits investigators have not determined if the device was planted inside or just outside the office building but it was the second blast , at about 10 30 am , that injured people the explosion , first believed to have originated from a large trash bin in the front corner of the lot , sent shrapnel into one investigator , and a television news reporter apparently hurt his head when he was knocked to the ground but none of the injuries seemed to be serious , investigators said hospitals treated and released most of the injured by the afternoon , including two agents from the federal bureau of investigation , an agent with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms and a fulton county firefighter of the many images i 've seen on the news today , said kent b alexander , the united states attorney here , one was of a friend of all of ours , an agent who lay with his hands bloodied and his face bloodied , we will not tolerate this in our community , and we expect to get to the bottom of it investigators did not know what kind of device was used and could not say for sure if the clinic , the atlanta northside family planning services , was its target the clinic is in sandy springs , just north of the city the building also contains offices for doctors , dentists and lawyers the bomb could have been intended for another target , mr alexander said , adding , we are not ruling out domestic terrorism unrelated to clinic violence but the first bomb was apparently placed either inside the clinic or just outside a window , the focus of the blast the explosion badly damaged part of the clinic s operating room , waiting room and counseling room it appears that the clinic was the target , said lieut c c cass of the atlanta police department the blast outraged politicians around the country , including president clinton he called the bombings a vile and malevolent act make no mistake , the president said , anyone who brings violence against a woman trying to exercise her constitutional rights is committing an act of terror the clinic was mostly empty today it sees patients on wednesdays , fridays and saturdays geralyn thompson , a 23yearold counselor at the clinic , would have been in the waiting room but was late for work she said she would have been sitting close to where the worst damage happened my guardian angel made me sleep late today , she said the blast sent pat pittler , an assistant in a dentist office , running i got out of there , she said people in atlanta could not help but be reminded of another blast , one that investigators have not solved and , instead , seemed to mishandle at first the bombing in centennial olympic park last summer , when federal investigators first pursued and then exonerated richard jewell , a security guard mr alexander said investigators would try to determine if the bomb today shared any characteristics with the olympic park bomb of july 27 , which killed one person this is probably about the worst place in the country to set off a bomb , said mr alexander , referring to the explosives experts who are in atlanta to work on the olympics case we are ready to pursue this professionally and expertly the second blast today puzzled investigators it almost seemed timed to hurt those coming to the scene to help , said mayor bill campbell of atlanta mr campbell asked the police to guard other atlanta abortion clinics the two explosions came as abortion rights advocates in washington were announcing at a news conference that such acts of violence had declined in the past year the feminist majority , at a news conference scheduled before news of the bombing went out on television , radio and on press wires , said that a survey of 312 clinics around the country showed 30 percent of those clinics reported acts of violence in 1996 , down from 39 percent in 1995 according to justice department statistics , there were at least 15 bombings or arsons at abortion clinics every year from 1993 to 1995 last year , there were only 7 but the violence directed against such clinics has been heating up in the past few weeks jan 22 marks the 24th anniversary of roe v wade , the 1973 supreme court decision that legalized abortion in the past month , a doctor at a baton rouge , la , abortion clinic was stabbed a planned parenthood office in dallas was robbed at gunpoint a phoenix clinic was the site of three unsuccessful arson attempts and a tulsa , okla , clinic was burned the bombing today was one more piece of evidence in a trail of violence leading up to the anniversary , said ann glazier , director of child defense and research at the planned parenthood federation of america and the type of attack that it was , ms glazier said , first the bombing of the clinic , and then the followup in the dumpster , which would be the normal path for people to come to help , to investigate , really marks this as the terrorist act that it is it s designed to instill fear in the community abortion protesters were mixed in their responses the national right to life committee denounced the bombings as deplorable and reprehensible but others , like paul deparrie , editor in chief of life advocate magazine , in portland , ore , said i think it is wonderful any time an abortion clinic is closed for whatever reason if the toilet backs up and closes the place , that is great i think it is great when babies' lives are saved through whatever means i am not going to try to condemn somebody that god wo n't condemn the bombing was perhaps the most violent act at least in its potential for destruction since four killings at abortion clinics in 1994 paul hill , a former minister , killed two people outside an abortion clinic in pensacola , fla , and john salvi killed two people at abortion clinics in massachusetts as shocking as it was then , it did n't catch us all off guard quite as much as this did , said claudia schauffler , the atlanta chairwoman of the national organization for women this act of violence comes at a time when people seem to be working towards coming to a middle ground , she said
the tough really got going at sotheby s last night if an artwork was in the form of a body part or an alien creature or even a pig the subjects of difficult works from the late 1980 s and early 90 s there was a passionate group of buyers wanting it the lean , mean sale of contemporary art that began the spring auction season last night showed how broad the market had become it also established a place at auction for artists like kiki smith and robert gober , matthew barney and rachel whiteread although they have all been popular , both at galleries and at auction , most of their work up for sale last night set records the sale totaled 152 million , just above sotheby s low estimate of 14 million of the 43 works for sale , only 7 failed to sell contemporary art is still a patchy area for auction houses little estate property comes on the market , since collectors in the field tend to be younger and classic works from the 1950 s and 60 s rarely come up for sale because owners are reluctant to part with them none of this seemed to matter last night the sale had a different feel about it than most of sotheby s contemporary art sales , and purposely so tobias meyer , who headed sotheby s contemporary art department in london for five years , was imported to new york this winter to become its director of contemporary art worldwide mr meyer is clearly out to shake things up and , along with sotheby s , to send clients a message that he is firmly entrenched \( the department in new york has had four heads in two years and six auctioneers in five years \) as last night s auctioneer in his first night sale in the united states , mr meyer played the audience in a nononsense , straightforward manner while he understood the material and had studied the room , knowing beforehand who would be interested in what , he did not resort to fancy theatrics instead , he kept the bidding even and controlled , very much in the manner of a london sale mr meyer choreographed the evening with a purpose by beginning with the 11 most recent works , he immediately set an optimistic tone these works were being sold by the boston children s heart foundation , and it was n't just their subject matter that was bizarre the collection was formed by dr bernardo nadalginard , a boston cardiologist serving a oneyear prison sentence for misappropriating money from the nonprofit research foundation in his buying days , dr nadalginard was offered the best of the newest artists last night , many collectors who missed out on buying these works the first time around were determined to buy robert gober s untitled wax leg of a girl , , for example , was expected to sell for 50 , 000 to 70 , 000 an unidentified bidder bought it for 96 , 000 , a record for the artist kiki smith s sculpture of a women crouched on the floor , urinating , had lots of takers two dealers , anthony d'offay of london and jeffrey deitch of new york , as well as eli broad , the california collector , were all fighting for the work it finally sold to mr d'offay for 233 , 500 , almost three times its high estimate of 80 , 000 and a record for the artist even a rubberandfoam mattress , untitled \( double amber bed \) , from 1991 , by the english artist rachel whiteread , who won the turner prize in 1993 , sold to mr d'offay for a whopping 167 , 500 , more than four times its 40 , 000 high estimate this will be the art that in 10 years people wished they had bought tonight , mr meyer said after the sale this is the art of our day , the end of the century more conventional contemporary works performed respectably , most within their estimates , but there was not the same naked passion as for the kinkier items one particularly popular work was cy twombly s untitled , an iron sculpture that resembles a found object several bidders fought it out , and the work finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for 442 , 500 , a record for the artist and far above its high estimate of 300 , 000 the sale also included works from the cbs corporate collection since the 1960 s , cbs had put together about 100 works , primarily paintings and prints , by artists like jean dubuffet , franz kline , jackson pollock and henry moore but after westinghouse electric corporation bought cbs two years ago , a decision was made to sell its most valuable art among its offerings last night was kline s crosstown \( 1955 \) this blackandwhite abstract work was bought for the collection by william c paley , the founder of cbs , more than 30 years ago estimated at 12 million to 15 million , it sold for 22 million to an unidentified bidder the cbs collection also included one of the evening s biggest casualties dubuffet s street theater \( 1962 \) , one of the artist s famous paris circus series and the cover of the sale catalogue , failed to attract even one bid sotheby s had estimated it would bring 1 million to 12 million , but no one would raise a paddle even for 650 , 000 \( final prices include the auction house s commission , 15 percent of the first 50 , 000 and 10 percent of the rest estimates do not reflect commissions \) another group came from the collection of william c janss , a california real estate developer who died in december 1996 sotheby s had given the heirs a guarantee \( an undisclosed minimum price regardless of a sale s outcome \) among the best works mark rothko s no 19 \( 1960 \) , a large red abstract painting estimated at 18 million to 22 million it sold to john berggruen , a san francisco dealer who was a big buyer last night for 22 million another strong abstract work , willem de kooning s untitled \( 1947 \) , an organically abstract work with shots of pink and yellow , sold below its estimate sotheby s had anticipated it would bring 2 million to 25 million , but it went for only 17 million to an unidentified telephone bidder there was much curiosity about how this painting would fare , for several reasons de kooning died in march , and collectors were interested in seeing how his work would be received after his death and tonight , christie s is selling amityville , an important later de kooning from 1971 that carries the same estimate mr meyer also included some works by artists more commonly seen in sales in london than in new york , lucio fontana s spacial concept \( 1957 \) , definitely appeals more to european than to american tastes the risk did n't pay off the painting failed to sell , with no bidder willing to pay more than 140 , 000 but another painting that was european in taste did do well yves klein s ikb 241 , a solid blue canvas from 1960 estimated at 250 , 000 to 300 , 000 , sold for 266 , 500 to an unidentified buyer i like to do things that i know may be a bit of a financial risk , mr meyer said but they add interest to the sale that makes it a bit different from the rest photo crosstown \( 1955 \) , by franz kline , sold last night for 22 million

an ordinance calling for a living wage for those doing work under contracts with new haven was greeted enthusiastically by a coalition of civic , religious and labor groups at a city hall hearing last month the proposed wage , 892 an hour plus 528 for health benefits , would amount to a hefty increase over what those workers make now 5 to 625 with no benefits for most even mayor john destefano jr and the city controller , gregory brown , supported a living wage in principle though not if it would lead to a tax increase for city residents even if the health care coverage was reduced to 2 an hour , mr brown estimated that the ordinance would cost the city about 27 million , and would result in an increase of 100 in property taxes on a 150 , 000 home the rev kevan hitch is pastor of first and summerfield methodist church on the new haven green and a member of elm city congregations organized , an ecumenical coalition of two dozen urban and suburban congregations known by its acronym , ecco the coalition strongly supported the proposed ordinance and put forth an amendment that would extend coverage to workers at any company having five or more employees and getting 25 , 000 or more in tax relief from the city we felt that the living wage issue was so crucial , we made it one of our goals at our convention last year , said mr hitch strong support also came from locals 34 and 35 of the hotel employees and restaurant employees , representing the 3 , 500 workers at yale university who finally settled on a new contract just before christmas , after more than a year of acrimonious struggle mayor destefano is largely credited with breaking the yearlong stalemate by urging yale to give its workers fair compensation one of the major issues we were facing at yale was the subcontracting of some of the work there , said andrea cole , a representative for the unions while we gave the university the right to subcontract , we did not want to see a whole new class of workers introduced who would be paid poverty wages , she said we were able to get an agreement that in the limited subcontracting the university does , it will not employ a contractor unless the contractor pays a living wage , defined as 7 per hour with no medical benefits ms cole added that the 892 plus health benefits was obviously a point from which to begin bargaining the coalition supporting the original proposal also includes the naacp , christian community action , centro san jose , mothers for justice , we the people and the central labor council of the aflcio living wage ordinances which vary widely in the amount of hourly pay and the kinds and numbers of workers covered have been passed in baltimore , st paul , milwaukee , new york city , jersey city , san jose and portland , ore , and have been proposed in several other cities in connecticut , living wage legislation was approved by the general assembly s labor committee in late march that bill sets the living wage at 60 percent of the average production wage , or the maximum hourly unemployment benefit christopher donovan , a democrat of meriden and a chairman of the labor committee , says that such an hourly wage comes to about 880 plus health coverage and pension payments the bill covers employers with 100 or more workers , as well as any corporations that receive state tax breaks supporters of the new haven ordinance invited the testimony of a public policy consultant who had researched the impact of baltimore s ordinance after the first year at the hearing , scott nova of the preamble center in washington , dc , said , we tried to look at the specific concerns raised by the opposition that the living wage would cause contract costs to rise , thus costing taxpayers more that there would be job loss that it would be expensive to administer that it would result in fewer contractors bidding on contracts , and most of all , that it would create an overall drop in the quality of life , and send a 'bad signal' to business none of that happened in baltimore , mr nova concluded in his testimony he also criticized both the numbers and the methodology that the state s controller , mr brown , used to arrive at his prediction of a tax increase mr brown , he said , had relied exclusively on the opinion of the contractors in determining costs mr brown , however , stood by his numbers and his methodology , saying that since the city is not privy to the contractors' books , he had to rely on what they told him he pointed out that the living wage ordinance in baltimore raised hourly wages to 610 from 550 the first year \( and to 660 the second year \) , and with that level of increase , you can shave costs and not have a tax increase mr brown also criticized the proposal for not clearly defining whether only subcontracted workers would be covered or whether some city workers most of them seasonal or temporary would also be included the disagreements and ambiguities sent the parties back to the drawing board in late march , just before the municipal services committee of the board of aldermen met to consider the proposal , the mayor and the aldermen sponsors set a compromise starting july 1 , hourly wages of those working on a city service contract will rise to 749 , rising to 892 in five years no health coverage is included mayor destefano called the compromise a positive sign that the city of new haven stands ready to support its economy and its working families the compromise clarifies who is not covered those in the professional trades and employees covered by existing collective bargaining agreements , as well as employees who work directly for the city subcontracted maintenance workers , security guards , school bus drivers and temporary clerical workers are examples of those who are covered the mayor s office estimates the proposal will cost the city 139 , 000 in direct costs , a number that could be absorbed without a tax increase alderman josh civin , who originally introduced the bill along with his colleagues philip voight and david moakley , said , we got something we could all live with as a first step the bill was passed almost unanimously by the municipal services committee on march 24 and will be voted on by the entire board at the end of this month mr civin says it stands a good chance of passage it s important , he said , that the mayor and the chairman of the democratic party have said publicly that this is a good thing \( new haven vote democratic overwhelmingly \) supporters wanted to add a section to the ordinance requiring contractors to hire a certain percentage of city residents , but were advised that such a requirement might be unconstitutional instead , the bill calls for setting up community hiring halls in city neighborhoods , and requires contractors to give first priority to new hires who come through them the workers can be from anywhere , mr civin says , but since the hiring halls are community based , most workers will be from new haven he says the health care provision will be looked at in future years , but that supporters dropped it for now partly because a federal law may make it illegal to require employers to offer health coverage mr civin predicts that 50 to 100 workers will be covered in the first year , but that the number will rise to at least 300 within five years because , as the wage gets higher , it affects more people ecco released a statement before the vote that it reluctlantly and with reservations supported the compromise bill as an adequate first step the statement went on to say that the two points that must still be addressed are the longterm consequences of minimumwage and lowwage work on our families and the longterm benefits of attracting developers and businesses with public money , without a corresponding moral obligation on their part to provide guarantees that they will not run away and they will provide familyfriendly wages and benefits
the offer made dr richard rubinson uneasy shortly after the columbia hospital corporation took control of the miami hospital in 1993 where he had long practiced , the company gave him and other doctors the chance to buy up to 20 percent of the institution by investing up to 150 , 000 each as investors , the company explained , the physicians would share in the hospital s financial risks and rewards such investment offers are common in american industry yet to dr rubinson , the former president of the dade county medical society , medicine is not just any industry he feared that his interests as an investor might conflict with his duty as a doctor to act in the best interests of patients columbia s investment deals , he felt , gave doctors the implicit understanding that the more patients there were , the more the return on your little piece would be it was , the 60yearold thoracic surgeon said , a message i just did n't want to respond to he declined columbia s offer in the last few years , several thousand doctors have been offered such investments by columbia , now known as the columbia hca healthcare corporation , the nation s largest health care company , with about 350 hospitals and hundreds of other medical facilities some , like dr rubinson , have begged off many others have not hospitals , of course , have long recruited doctors with generous enticements like signing bonuses , consulting contracts and outright purchases of their practices for columbia , able to bring vast wealth to the courting game , these deals have been instrumental in the drive to dominate medical marketplaces but , because their financial returns are tied directly to those of their hospitals , the doctorinvestors are stepping into different and , to many health care experts , troubling territory not only do they raise the kind of ethical issues that so worried dr rubinson some of the investments are raising legal questions as well in recent months , columbia s financial relationships with its doctors have come under heightened legal scrutiny the federal agency that runs medicare is examining whether columbia doctorinvestors are violating a federal conflictofinterest law when they send patients to services like home care that are operated through hospitals where they have stakes many of the investors in el paso were served with search warrants as part of a federal inquiry involving the company and a doctor who invested in a columbia partnership in texas has sued the company , saying that some of its deals with physicians violate the law to examine the investments' effects , the new york times analyzed referral patterns of 62 doctors in the miami area since columbia does not make partnership records public , the study was based on limited information but it showed that after investing , the doctors as a group referred more patients than before to columbia hospitals and fewer to competing hospitals columbia called the study flawed and said investments did not influence admissions though a handful of far smaller companies also offer doctors investments , columbia has used them from its inception and is their most forceful proponent after putting a hold on such plans for several years , while absorbing hundreds of new acquisitions , columbia has started to offer them again bringing doctors on as investors , the company s executives say , is nothing more than an effort at smoothing the oftenfractious relationship between hospitals and physicians they say the investments give doctors an identification with the company s mission this , they say , leads to savings because the investors are thus more prone to listen to reasonable plans for economies and to improvements in care that come through the cooperation with the hospital that is needed in the era of managed care we believe that physician integration is best achieved if we columbia and doctors have a common vision of our future and share in governance , risk , reward and ownership , said dr frank m houser , president of columbia physician services but many medical professionals look at this new doctorhospital relationship and come away asking questions like these with hospital administrators pressing to cut costs , will doctors with investments acquiesce more easily to cuts in nursing care and other services \? with hospitals increasingly forced to accept fixed payments for care , no matter how much they actually spend to provide it , will doctors shrink more readily from ordering medically beneficial but costly tests and treatments \? and will the investments influence where doctors send patients \? especially , will they tend to refer patients who cannot pay , and others with costly cases , to hospitals where they do not have a stake and refer the more profitable ones to their investment hospitals \? and will they tend to send patients to outside medical services in which the company has a stake , even if such treatment is not medically necessary or could be provided more effectively elsewhere \?
geneva , april 15 after a vigorous lobbying campaign that divided european members of a united nations commission , china today defeated a resolution condemning its human rights record , preventing even debate on the issue it was the seventh consecutive year that resolutions assailing china have failed before the united nations human rights commission beijing s victory today , on a vote of 27 to 17 , was by its widest margin ever wu jianmin , china s delegate , termed the vote a victory for cooperation over confrontation earlier , in a speech to an audience packed in the woodpaneled united nations meeting room , mr wu labeled the resolution an outrageous distortion of china s reality and said it reflected western attempts to dominate china s fate he said the chinese people had no human rights to speak of before the communists came to power in 1949 , and he dismissed the resolution criticizing china s rights record and its treatment of tibet as western impudence he said china had followed its own course for 5 , 000 years and would continue to do so mr wu said the west had a powerful interest in preserving china s stability , saying that if even 1 percent of his countrymen 12 million people were to flee , the prosperity of east asia would be destroyed overnight in washington , secretary of state madeleine k albright said the united states regretted the vote we recognize that no nation is perfect , and that none has all the answers , she said but we also believe that human rights are a legitimate subject for discussion among nations on this , we differ with china resolutions against china were first introduced at the commission in 1990 after the violent crackdown against prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing this year , diplomats said , china waged a particularly assertive campaign against the resolution france and germany refused to cosponsor the resolution condemning beijing , prompting human rights groups to accuse france of softening its position in order to win a major plane deal when president jacques chirac visits china next month the netherlands , which holds the rotating presidency of the 15member european union , then balked at introducing other human rights motions in protest against the french and german stand on china it later relented we 've had disagreements before , but this is the first time we are hanging our dirty linen out because of such a disagreement , said the dutch delegate , peter van wulfften palthe the resolution criticizing china was sponsored by denmark and the united states denmark urged the 53 nations of the commission to hold china to the same rules as other member countries tyge lehmann , denmark s delegate , said after the vote china conducted a rather aggressive campaign that has paid off there were a lot of threats china announced before the vote that it was canceling some official visits with denmark because of its sponsorhip of the resolution unperturbed by chinese actions , mr lehmann pointed out that denmark imports three times as many chinese goods as it exports to china american officials insisted that the resolution had been a matter of principle , and that the twohour debate had helped keep the spotlight on china s human rights record today s vote was on a procedural motion that the united nations take no action on the resolution nine countries , including russia , abstained

pasadena , calif , july 12 brian muirhead , deputy project manager for the mars pathfinder mission , sat in the control room at the jet propulsion laboratory here , waiting for sunrise on mars and the next communications with the spacecraft he looked a little out of place at 45 , he is one of the project s senior citizens , a balding , bearded man among brighteyed , bushymaned youth getting their initiation in space flight the last time a spacecraft landed on mars , in 1976 , many of the engineers in charge of pathfinder were in grade school or just entering kindergarten some oldtimers were in college mr muirhead figured that the average age of the people who designed , tested and guided the spacecraft and its rover as many as 500 people is in the low 30 s so not only is the 266 million pathfinder mission the first in a new era of ambitious mars exploration , but it has brought to the fore a whole new generation of planetary explorers , young men and women meeting the challenge with refreshing esprit they carry their seriousness lightly , bubbling with excitement each time their lander or their rover does well on their planet they are also learning by their mistakes , as others did in the past a slight miscalculation sent the roving vehicle sojourner bumping into a large rock a timing mistake in transmitting instructions caused both the pathfinder and sojourner to lose a day of work on friday we had to do things differently on this mission , inventing new ways to land on mars at low cost , mr muirhead said younger people were highly motivated by this challenge they were not bound by traditions of earlier projects , and they were more willing to take chances looking around the room , he called to a woman at a computer console in one corner , sitting under a mars or bust sign cindy , how old are you \? cindy oda , an engineer who started out designing mission software and now sends the daily commands to pathfinder , is 32 at another console sat rebecca manning , 25 , a flight controller who joined the project three years ago , right out of college her first work was testing the entry , descent and landing procedures for the spacecraft i had n't even thought about space until i got this job , she said now i do n't think i could give it up david gruel , 27 , is known as the project s gremlin his assignment has been to think of things that could go wrong with the lander or rover and then find ways to overcome the problems in recent days , he has spent his nights in a 30 by 50foot sand box , using models to test the next maneuvers for sojourner one of the most prominent young members of the team is jennifer harris , 28 she was the flight director during the tense hours after the radio link between sojourner and pathfinder suddenly and mysteriously went on the blink it was the day after the landing , and for a while , the mission s success seemed in doubt for hours ms harris , wearing earphones , stood coolly in front of her console , asking questions of other controllers , weighing their answers , conferring with engineers and project managers eventually the crisis passed engineers are still not sure what caused or corrected the communications lapse many of the young team members , like ms harris , said they feel comfortable in their demanding jobs because they have worked closely together for more than three intense years , becoming , they often said , like family as ms harris told reporters , we have a camaraderie that s beyond belief the young pathfinder engineers are already in demand by other projects they 're being snatched away from us , said dr donna shirley , manager of the mars exploration office at the laboratory there are several reasons for the emergence in this mission of a new generation , officials said in the late 1970 s through most of the 1980 s , new planetary missions were few and far between and the laboratory , which is part of the national aeronautics and space administration , had no money to hire new people existing projects like the two voyagers to the outer planets and galileo , which is now orbiting jupiter , consumed years of preparation and flight , with their teams aging on the job the typical mission team then was much grayer once the first of the new missions to mars were approved early in this decade , many of the engineers and scientists who pioneered planetary flight in the 1960 s had retired and others were occupied with galileo or cassini , a large spacecraft to orbit saturn that is to be launched this fall the result was an infusion of youth to take on mars , and a more exuberant way of doing things much of the credit for turning the exuberance into creativity , team members say , should go to tony spear , the project manager , who has the white hair befitting his 61 years mr spear gave the young people wide latitude if they did the work , they got the job , whatever their age he gave us enough rope , and none of us swung , mr muirhead said all week after the landing , mr spear let the younger team leaders take the bows for the project at news conferences you are young , he told them , you need the glory now that they have cut their teeth professionally , the new generation should have many opportunities to apply their newly gained experience over the next eight years , american spacecraft are to be launched to mars at every opportunity once every 26 months drawing on pathfinder s technology current plans call for a mission in 2005 to return rocks from mars for analysis on earth , then at least two more samplereturn flights mr muirhead said that at the end of the year he expected to shift to planning a mission to land on a comet and bring back the first sample showing what comets are made of the spacecraft has been named champollion , after the frenchman jeanfrancois champollion , who deciphered the rosetta stone if the mission is approved , the craft will be launched in 2005 and mr spear , who has been at the laboratory since 1962 , will be leaving the pathfinder team in a few days he will begin research on new technology for miniaturized spacecraft to fly to the outer planets as long as it s this good , mr spear said , reflecting on pathfinder s success and the prospect of developing more new ways to explore the planets , i'm going to stick around and get older here photo pathfinder team members are bringing youthful enthusiasm to the project brian muirhead , 45 , foreground , is a deputy project manager \( associated press \)
philadelphia , may 25 the mets are basking in the glow of their surprising start , knowing that if they were playing in a national league division other than the east , they would be at or near the top of the standing but they have a weakness hidden by their success , a problem bound to hurt them sooner or later that trouble spot is middlerelief pitching , which has left the mets' starting rotation bearing the brunt of the workload this season the starters got an extra day of rest when rain washed out today s game here against the phillies , but the met starters have had few other breaks not one has been displaced or scratched since pete harnisch could not pitch on april 6 the rotation has produced 16 consecutive starts of 6 or more innings , and the starters have failed to pitch 5 or more innings only 4 times in 48 games we 're a pretty good team because of the starting pitching , said bobby valentine , manager of the 2622 mets , propping his feet on his desk after hearing of the rainout but the middle relief continues to fester the mets have tried numerous candidates , from toby borland to brian bohanon and now rick trlicek , without a change in the results on saturday night , the mets built an 81 lead behind starter armando reynoso , and valentine , wanting to rest reynoso and protect his surgically repaired right elbow , replaced him for the eighth inning as usual , that was when trouble started barry manuel gave up two hits in the eighth but kept the phillies from scoring trlicek relieved in the ninth , and the phillies soon mounted a comeback rather than an easy , uneventful finish , the mets were forced , once more , to rely on greg mcmichael and john franco philadelphia scored two runs against trlicek , and the pitching coach bob apodaca summoned mcmichael for his 22d appearance of the season mcmichael , whose ineffectiveness of late could be related to his alltooregular work , allowed a single to mickey morandini before walking scott rolen the mets' lead shrank to 84 , and the phillies had the tying run at the plate in darren daulton franco , rushed into service , retired daulton on a groundout to end the game this was another example of how the mets' middle relief could hurt them if the starting pitching falters valentine used trlicek as a setup man in class aaa norfolk last year , but acknowledged that the righthander is not showing the same caliber of stuff since joining the mets he has allowed four earned runs in three appearances , walking three and striking out none in three innings he s got the same repertoire , but he s not as sure of his command of the slider , valentine said he s got a little different mechanics , also another righthander , cory lidle , has not allowed a run in five outings , but the rookie is a controlstyle pitcher who had not pitched above class aa before this year manuel has worked in long relief , once going two weeks between appearances the other lefthander in the bullpen , takashi kashiwada , is in his first weeks in the majors steve phillips , the mets' assistant general manager , has said repeatedly that when the mets discuss possible trades , they ask about relievers met general manager joe mcilvaine made one proposal for dan plesac , the toronto lefthander , and had extensive conversations with anaheim about chuck mcelroy before mcelroy was traded to the chicago white sox now , as teams begin to fall out of their respective races , relievers are becoming available cincinnati general manager jim bowden has made it known that he is ready to trade , and he could be ready to swap the righthanders jeff brantley or jeff shaw the tigers are willing to trade the righthander todd jones , a hard thrower for now , the starters continue to carry the mets , and as long as they do , the bullpen problem will be lost in the shadows but it will not go away inside pitch sunday s rainout will be made up as part of a doubleheader in philadelphia on sept 15 , beginning at 5 05 pm manager bobby valentine will keep his rotation in line despite the rainout , with rick reed , mark clark and bobby jones scheduled to pitch in the series in montreal that begins monday jones will pitch against pedro martinez on wednesday in a matchup of the national league s eightgame winners bill pulsipher , rehabilitating in the minors , had a shaky start in class a st lucie s game against lakeland on sunday his numbers six innings , seven hits , four earned runs , five walks , four strikeouts , two wild pitches and a balk he left losing , 51
jan kamieniec moved into the house in maspeth , queens , because the price was right 250 a month for a room and kitchen privileges in someone else s thirdfloor apartment he could have afforded something better and safer , his friends and sister said his hourly wage making stone counter tops had risen in recent years to more than 10 from 650 but mr kamieniec , 43 , was supporting an 80yearold mother he had left behind in poland in 1991 and was trying to save for the future the bargain rent helped janusz kosmowski , 39 , paid even less , but all he got was a space in the cellar neighbors disagreed about whether he stayed there occasionally or regularly , for nothing or for a token pittance but they concurred that he had hit tough times , and that the balm of alcohol was making them tougher still i ca n't figure out how it happened , his wife , jadwiga , said after the fire , in an interview in her apartment in pisz , poland , where a faux persian carpet on the living room floor and terra cotta tiles in the bathroom were measures of how much money mr kosmowski had sent home during a decade in america i thought everything was all right mr kamieniec , whose fortunes seemed to be rising , and mr kosmowski , whose luck was ebbing , were among four polish immigrants killed two weeks ago when flames engulfed 6001 56th road in maspeth both were living on the cheap in a house that had been sliced and diced to accommodate more tenants the fire drew attention not only to such illegal conversions throughout queens , but also to the immigrants who rely on these makeshift , dangerous accommodations the stories of the dead men , and of scores of polish immigrants like them in maspeth , are varied they are dreamers tripping on obstacles they cannot control and drifters hitting snags of their own making they are ascetics essentially volunteering for deprivation so that faraway relatives can know glimmers of luxury , and they are vagrants with no other choice they are , in other words , like millions of immigrants before them and millions since , beckoned by a promise that turned out to be more complicated than they had imagined a problem almost all of them face is finding inexpensive shelter basic onebedroom apartments cost 700 to 800 a month , and the landlords of those legal units do not want to rent to groups of single men who plan to share the space so the men burrow into illicit corners and cubicles it s either that or living in the park , teresa vavak sanchez , a polishamerican social worker in maspeth , said a lot of the guys , what happens to them is they break down emotionally and start drinking then their lives really go to ruins mr kamieniec , mr kosmowski and frank glowacki who owned the house and was socializing with mr kosmowski in the cellar when the fire started around 9 20 pm on april 20th were all drunk when they died , according to autopsy results dr charles s hirsch , the new york city medical examiner , said he could not release specific blood alcohol levels , but described the three men as far beyond what would be considered impaired for the purposes of driving a car the fourth victim , kazimierz cielas , 41 , who shared the cellar with mr kosmowski and also died there , was sober , his autopsy showed but mr cielas s acquaintances said that he , along with mr kosmowski , drank frequently , a fact these acquaintances characterized as a cause , or perhaps consequence , of the men s diminished fortunes in recent years like mr kosmowski , mr cielas had come from pisz , also in 1986 , and he , too , had left behind a wife he told her he would be back as soon as he had earned enough for a car , according to his mother , anna but months turned to years and years to a decade , and her son did not return , mrs cielas said she , like mrs kosmowski , expressed ignorance of just how badly he was living in maspeth oh , god , how could i imagine it all those people living in a black hole in the basement \? mrs cielas said in her apartment in pisz mr glowacki , 44 , was an immigrant of much longer standing he lived with his wife , barbara , and two children , ages 13 and 9 , in port chester , a suburb in westchester county barbara glowacki said that he had come to america in 1971 and , over the years , had owned and operated polish delicatessens in manhattan , brooklyn and queens when he bought one at 6001 56th road in maspeth in 1984 , mrs glowacki said , it came with two stories of housing above it she said she knew little about her husband s dealings as a landlord according to city records , there should have been only two apartments , one on each of the upper floors but former residents of the building , which was demolished after the fire , said that the third floor had been illegally split into a twobedroom apartment with a rent of 650 a month and a onebedroom apartment with a rent of 550 mr kamieniec subleased a room from a polish couple in the larger apartment mr glowacki never registered the building as the de facto multiple dwelling it had become , which would have required him to install a fire escape when flames swept up the staircase , tenants had to fling themselves and their children out of windows mr kamieniec , who was on the third floor , did not escape
one contender has already started a television advertising blitz another has an elaborate web page , and others vow to follow soon news releases are circulating , money is being solicited and behindthescenes jockeying is going on in westchester s cities , town and villages and just about everyone is promising to reduce taxes the race to succeed andrew p o'rourke as the westchester county executive is under way in various forums , both public and private first to be resolved is who will get the official party nomination of the republican , democratic and conservative parties then could come republican and democratic primaries in september and the election in november since mr o'rourke , a republican , announced in february that he would retire after 14 years as county executive , candidates for his job have come and , in some cases , gone others are still assessing their chances in this , the first county executive race since 1973 that does not involve an incumbent whoever the candidate is , this will have to be a different kind of campaign than the kind i usually run , said paul j feiner , the supervisor of greenburgh , who two weeks ago withdrew from consideration for the democratic nomination for county executive you ca n't chat with everybody in the supermarket democratic enrollment of voters in the county has been growing and now surpasses that of the republicans by about 40 , 000 votes but to varying degrees , depending on the race , that registration edge is offset by the influence of the large block of independent voters not enrolled in a party and of the conservative party , which frequently endorses republican candidates in the race for the republican nomination at this time are ted dunn , 60 , the mayor of rye , who started his campaign about two years ago and began a television advertising campaign this month vicenza restiano , 48 , president of the yonkers city council , who changed her registration from democratic to republican two years ago , and george delaney , 61 , of briarcliff , a vice president of con edison , who formerly headed its westchester division and now works in its manhattan office two democrats are officially in the race sandra r galef , 57 , of ossining , a state assemblywoman and former county legislator , and andrew j spano , 60 , of yorktown , the former county clerk and until recently chairman of the westchester democratic committee other potential candidates include richard l brodsky of greenburgh , a state assemblyman who ran unsuccessfully against mr o'rourke in 1989 and 1993 ronald c tocci of new rochelle , a state assemblyman , and george latimer of rye , a county legislator collectively , all the candidates say they favor reduction in county taxes , support a woman s right to choose an abortion and back efforts by the city of yonkers to use a small parcel of parkland for housing to meet a courtordered desegregation plan they tend to accept the concept of privatization of some county services when and if the proper analysis has been made , they all caution and have mixed views on reassessing all property in the county earlier this month , mr dunn , a former managing director of the investment banking concern morgan stanley , was given the backing of the executive committee of the westchester county republican committee the endorsement not binding on the full committee came at a hastily called meeting the day before a scheduled meeting of the westchester conservative committee the action was meant to derail ms restiano s efforts to win the conservative party endorsement and , at least for now , it succeeded apparently concerned that a split with the republicans would mean a defeat in november , the conservative committee put off backing ms restiano , who has been endorsed by vincent natrella , the conservative committee leader the conservatives will probably take the matter up again later this month although it seems likely that the republicans will have a primary no matter whom they officially endorse , this will not be the case for the conservatives because none of the three republican candidates is an enrolled conservative , the candidates may run on the conservative line only with permission of the conservative committee it is highly unlikely that the party would endorse one candidate and then allow a second to run in a primary the conservative party is an important piece of this , but not the only piece , said mr dunn , who is completing his fourth year as mayor of rye , westchester s smallest city ms restiano , who serves as the council president of yonkers , westchester s largest city , predicted she would ultimately receive the endorsement from the conservatives she also rejected the suggestion that she might eventually withdraw in favor of mr dunn i'm in this all the way , ms restiano said so , too , is mr delaney , who is making his first bid for public office i'm convinced that restiano and dunn will knock each other out , he said he likened his campaign to the grassroots aspect of ross perot s candidacy , and said he is prepared to spend as much as mr dunn does on the democratic front , mrs galef , a county legislator from 1980 to 1992 and a state assemblywoman since then , all but concedes the official democratic committee endorsement to mr spano it s hard to get the designation when you 're running against the former party chairman who just resigned to run for county executive , she said her efforts , therefore , will focus on the primary , she said mr spano , who was county clerk from 1983 to 1993 , won the party s designation for county executive in 1993 but lost the democratic primary to assemblyman brodsky \( who lost the general election to mr o'rourke \) mr spano , who is out of public office , is the owner of a company that does electronic commerce on the internet and designed a web page \( www andyspano com \) for him he assails mrs galef s voting record , saying philosophically , we 're different i favor minimum wages she s against it i favor family leave she s against it and there are other issues the fact that so many women are flocking to my campaign shows that these will be issues mrs galef countered a big difference between me and andy spano is he has never voted on anything he has never been a legislator her votes , she said , were well thought out and were based on balancing competing needs for example , she said she opposed extending the federal family leave act to cover employers with fewer than 15 people because of economic considerations and concern that families would have been adversely affected by a negative economic climate things are never so black and white , she said

russelsheim , germany , jan 10 by the time he walked into robert strauss s washington law office tuesday afternoon , jens neumann , the chief lawyer for volkswagen ag , knew who was holding the cards the general motors corporation for nearly four years , mr neumann had been locked in a bitter and visceral legal battle with gm over accusations of industrial spying as recently as a year ago , vw had managed to bog down gm s case against jose ignacio lopez de arriortua , the former gm executive who stood accused of stealing thousands of documents when he defected to volkswagen it was a legal tangle that the shrewd mr neumann and mr strauss , the influential democrat and former ambassador who worked for vw , had helped throw around general motors just how gm reversed course and won a big settlement from vw on thursday is a story about the fierce determination by some of gm s top executives and directors for the company to assert itself , the auto maker s own detective work and its collaboration with the german and american criminal law enforcement authorities but the biggest turning point was gm s decision to take a chance last march and file a lawsuit against vw in detroit that laid out in stunning detail the thousands of pages of documents taken by mr lopez or his friends papers that contained confidential information about one of the most closely guarded subjects in the automobile industry what manufacturers pay for parts the case also contended that mr lopez had walked off with gm s secret plans for plant x , a new , costefficient experiment to assembling cars and trucks after that suit and a series of court rulings brushing aside vw s bids to thwart it , gm had the upper hand and volkswagen was desperate to settle it also did not hurt that mr lopez and several of his associates had recently been charged with fraud by the german prosecutors settlement talks began in earnest in september , and by thursday , both sides had a deal vw agreed in principle to pay gm 100 million , to buy at least 1 billion worth of gm parts in the next seven years and to issue a statement acknowledging gm s concerns with respect to possible wrongdoing in the business world , managers , scientists , talented engineers and creative producers are wooed away from one company to join a competitor every day but increasingly , companies are turning to the courts for compensation when they feel valuable information and ideas have been taken the lopez case stands out as parable for jilted employers and as a cautionary tale for workers who clean out their files assuming that no one will make a fuss now mr lopez , who resigned from vw several weeks ago and has been out of sight for months , will probably face a criminal trial later this year in germany and volkswagen , which for a long time insisted that it had never received any documents , has agreed to send gm back whatever is left from mr lopez s hoard there really is no dispute any longer that he took our confidential documents , thomas a gottschalk , gm s general counsel , said they recognize that that occurred in many respects , the easiest part of gm s job was collecting damaging evidence against mr lopez and several associates who had followed him from gm to volkswagen in 1993 gm s sleuths reconstructed mr lopez s activities before leaving gm on an almost hourbyhour basis , pinpointing an array of classified documents he shipped to volkswagen , including some on a vw plane the evidence included cartons of documents seized at the home of mr lopez s associates affidavits about a secretive documentprocessing operation mr lopez had set up at volkswagen offices and more but most of that evidence had been in the hands of the german prosecutors a year after mr lopez quit gm and the case had seemed to stagnate for the next two years it was not until gm s decision last march to file a suit in united states district court in detroit that invoked racketeering statues that the tide began to turn by using the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act in some of its accusations , gm left vw open to triple damages if the charges held up in court in a series of decisions late last year , federal district judge nancy edmonds turned back vw s moves to block the case and set the stage for a trial that would have been embarrassing to volkswagen and possibly exposed it to billions of dollars in damages the civil suit may also have galvanized the german prosecutors after reviewing evidence for nearly three years , the prosecutors let it be known in october that they would probably be filing charges against mr lopez and several of his associates within the last six months , three or four events went our way , said david herman , the chief executive of gm s adam opel carmaking subsidiary in germany taken together , gm officials said today , these events suddenly put it in an extremely powerful legal position but the conflict also posed a ticklish choice for gm , which had a great deal to do with its own eagerness to sign a peace pact
washington , june 20 news of a settlement between tobacco companies and antismoking forces today stirred cautious reactions from many on capitol hill and outright skepticism from others but members of congress on both sides of the debate agreed that any deal that eventually wins their approval will require a mountain of legislative and bureaucratic changes we 're going to look at it slowly and carefully , speaker newt gingrich said news of the 360 billion settlement between the tobacco companies and the attorneys general of 40 states hit capitol hill when many lawmakers were already headed home significantly , none of those who were still at work and eager to take the microphone to react , rejected the idea of a settlement outright but within an hour , some lawmakers were making it clear that today s agreement would be taken by congress as essentially a rough draft that would have to be rewritten i do n't expect congress to rubberstamp it , said senator frank r lautenberg , a new jersey democrat and one of the most ardent tobacco foes on capitol hill there are devils in the agreement that we will have to get out of there mr lautenberg said that among the devils in the details he foresaw were the need to enact laws to limit the liability of the tobacco industry and to decide who gets what money , including how much lawyers should be paid senator edward m kennedy , democrat of massachusetts , complained that the proposal was clearly underfunded and contained one glaring omission any agreement should include a very substantial payment to the federal government for the costs incurred by medicare , veteran s health programs , and other federal health programs for the treatment of tobaccorelated illnesses , mr kennedy said initial reactions like those hinted at the subtle ways that the politics of tobacco have changed as the negotiations over today s agreement proceeded and at how the two sides of the fight over cigarettes will have to find new ways to accommodate president clinton , for example , took credit in denver today for forcing the tobacco companies to the bargaining table by seeking to regulate the industry but he held the bargain itself at arm s length , as the white house had carefully kept the negotiations at arm s length , saying he needed to give the agreement strict scrutiny to see if it advances the public health and will reduce the number of children who are smoking cigarettes as expected , senator lauch faircloth , a north carolina republican who is one of tobacco s staunchest defenders , expressed some opposition , but in populist terms mr faircloth warned that he would fight any plan by big lawyers that he felt hurt the little guy tobacco farmers who form the base of his state s agricultural economy some antitobacco lawmakers worried that any deal the cigarette companies signed must be a loaded one and others began adding conditions three democratic senators from nontobaccogrowing states , for instance , urged that any settlement approved by congress and the white house include provisions to address worldwide tobacco sales by american cigarette manufacturers many of those who reacted to the news of the tobacco deal said they had not had the chance to study it in any detail but at first glance they said it would require major new legislation , including redefining the role of the federal drug administration to give the agency more authority mr kennedy , the senior democrat on the labor and human resources committee , said that the deal raised more questions than it answered and that he was wary of it given the track record , deceit , manipulation and bad faith by the tobacco industry , there is every reason to be skeptical of any agreement which the tobacco industry is willing to support , he said there is a sizable contingent of antitobacco members in both houses of congress , where 76 members from both sides of the aisle are part of the congressional task force on tobacco and health but as mr lautenberg warned today , the industry still has friends in congress no one on capitol hill is more supportive of tobacco than mr faircloth , which would seem to make it unlikely that he would ultimately oppose a deal struck by the big tobacco companies themselves but the senator said today that he had some problems with the agreement the government , the public interests groups , the tobacco companies and the trial lawyers sitting at the negotiating table can all take care of themselves , mr faircloth said my concern is the farmers and factory workers who are n't even allowed in that room we may know the broad outlines of a settlement but i'm interested in the fine print , he continued people will continue to use tobacco , so surely an agreement can be reached that both stops underage smoking and protects the interests of farmers and factory workers but the three democratic senators threatened an even wider fight over the issue , asking the president to back provisions for worldwide sanctions against tobacco companies the responsibility of the congress and the administration in this matter does not end at our water s edge , senators richard j durbin of illinois , tom harkin of iowa and ron wyden of oregon said in a letter to mr clinton the efforts to reduce and eliminate smoking by minors in this country should not be bankrolled by the unimpeded and likely accelerated marketing and promotion of us tobacco products to youngsters abroad in denver , before a meeting at the economic summit meeting he is attending , mr clinton commended the attorneys general and others who sued the companies but he said that before judging the agreement s merits he was appointing bruce reed , his domestic policy adviser , and donna e shalala , the secretary of health and human services , to examine it for a matter of weeks , not months in the meantime , he said , the administration would continue with its own efforts to regulate tobacco the best political outcome , one senior administration official said today , was also the most rigorous possible agreement with the industry or , failing that , the stiffest possible regulation to protect public health mr clinton said today thathe still had many questions , including how much freedom the food and drug administration would have to regulate tobacco the no 1 thing for us would be the scope and nature of the fda jurisdiction and then how will the money be spent , will it really advance the public health , he said michael d mccurry , the president s press secretary , said the negotiators late in the talks sought a signal from the white house about what it would consider acceptable the likelihood that this agreement will pass muster was increased by the fact that we refrained from sending that signal , he said , noting that the attorneys general got concessions even at the 11th hour another official said that , had it participated directly in the talks , the administration would have faced two risks the deal might look less palatable to the republican congress if it was perceived as a clinton product and if public health groups decided to fight the agreement , the tobacco industry might feel emboldened to resist all regulation
lansing , mich , march 6 washington may be absorbed with the daily twists and turns of the campaign fundraising controversy , but here in central michigan today it barely cast a shadow over president clinton as he became the first chief executive since theodore roosevelt to address a joint session of the michigan legislature delivering a speech in which he urged adopting national education standards in reading and mathematics and making improvements in the welfare bill that was passed last year , mr clinton received a rousing reception from democrats and republicans alike , including gov john engler , a republican , who supports many of the same ideas on education and welfare more than a few republican lawmakers to say nothing of democrats strained , fairly leaping over ropes , to touch mr clinton or shake his hand as he entered the house and walked down the center aisle the effect was just the one that the white house had hoped for the trip was the second in a series of visits to state legislatures intended to blunt the troubles over campaign financing and allow mr clinton to whip up interest in his domestic agenda residents of michigan demonstrated what pollsters have been saying for weeks and what the white house is counting on , that campaign finance is not a burning issue for average americans maybe people would talk about it over breakfast , but they would n't dwell on it , cheryl chapko , chief of staff to state senator harry gast , republican of st joseph , said as she sat in the capitol gallery people here feel like they are removed from washington they have enough problems here in michigan without dwelling on washington another visitor in the gallery , john pirich , a lawyer from lansing and a democrat , said we all know it takes money to get elected people here have been subject to the ravages of the cyclical impact of the auto industry they 're worrying if they still have their jobs the president s 45minute speech gave no hint of troubles back east nor was the audience response an indication that his popularity had flagged lawmakers on both sides of the aisle stood several times to underscore their enthusiasm for points that mr clinton stressed , like children who fell victim to political bickering over educational programs that , mr clinton said , is selling their future right down the drain he received another bipartisan ovation at the end , and later , returning to washington on air force one , he sounded at once like president and former governor of arkansas , saying i love state legislatures they are all real life but was he not worried , a reporter asked , that the unfolding drama over campaign donations was shouting out his agenda \? he flashed a wideangle smile and said , i thought my message got through just fine of his mood , he said , i am doing great the distance between the universes of washington and lansing was also visible earlier , when mr clinton s spokesman , michael j mccurry , briefed reporters after the speech mr mccurry was asked only isolated questions about points that mr clinton addressed on education and welfare or other issues , with the rest focusing on hillary rodham clinton s chief of staff , margaret a williams , and interpretations of the laws that govern political contributions that , in the administration s view , will keep her out of trouble he s well aware we 're in a feeding frenzy , and he s got to endure it mr mccurry said of his boss and not looking the least bit exasperated at yet another defense of administration goingson he s pretty used to this environment at the end of the briefing , mr mccurry asked , any michigan questions \? there were none the trip followed by a month a similar visit to lawmakers in maryland , where the reaction was much the same but although he broke no new ground today , he seemed to bask in the glow of friendly surroundings and his momentary connection to the last president who stood in the same spot when he closed his remarks by saying , thank you for making me feel so welcome today , it sounded very sincere
in 1938 orson welles shocked the radio audience with his realistic adaptation of the war of the worlds sean burns , 9 , of chappaqua , ny , had a similar reaction recently when he turned to his favorite rock station , wrgxfm , 1071 , which is in hawthorne , ny , and heard nothing but musical themes from old television shows he thought martians had taken over the station , his mother , leslie lew burns , said at the same time in long branch , nj , listeners to a golden oldie station , wzvufm , 1071 , lost their favorite music while those tuned to wwhbfm , 1071 , in hampton bays , li , wondered what happened to the traditional rock two days later the television themeshow music disappeared no aliens had landed , but the stations were suddenly playing ballads of lost loves , lonesome prairies and woeful ventures into gambling a company called odyssey communications , which operates three stations spanning the new york city region , established a trimulcast called new country y107 , all synchronized to 1071 fm we needed some time to physically gear up for the format change , said steve blatter , vice president of programming for odyssey , explaining the mysterious episode the y in the call letters was chosen because it was an easy way to remember the station position on the dial and would help create a different identity , mr blatter said mike kakoyiannis , the company s president and chief executive officer , said radio s largest market has gone too long without a country radio station the format opportunity has been obvious , the need has been obvious , the support has been obvious the new programming , begun in december , ended a 10month absence of country music in new york radio but what made the company think that substantial numbers of the 14 million listeners in new york , new jersey and connecticut as well as on long island s east end wanted to hear country music \? first of all , mr blatter answered in a telephone interview from his office in hawthorne , country music today is not country music of 15 years ago he continued its greatest appeal is its 'relateability' the majority of the songs have lyrics that relate to adults they include lost loves but also about going out and having fun on saturday night but a sample listening recently revealed sounds similar to ones heard from rural jukeboxes decades ago mr blatter said the age of the target audience for y107 they are still working out the call letters was 25 to 54 , observing that of the more than 50 am and fm stations in the area , none except for a small station in western suffolk county , ny , offered country music we conducted two large research studies in the new york market to check the format viability , mr blatter said the research made us confident that the format is very viable it just has been underachieving over the last four or five years his program is relying on the music of garth brooks , clint black , shania twain and reba mcentire as well as distinctive promotion and presentation to make country music a radio staple odyssey headquarters as well as its westchester station are in an office park in hawthorne , its antenna a few miles away in the shadow of the westchester county penitentiary , which is also used for the police radio band each station is only 3 , 000 watts , but odyssey said there is a multiplier effect giving the station a broader range by using the trimulcast the company based its optimism for success in the new york region in part on a trimulcast in los angeles where it envisioned a need for mainstream rock on its klyyfm radio station and said it went from 50 , 000 to 600 , 000 listeners in six months is the perception of enthusiasm for country music connected to the popularity of country or line dancing in the suburbs \? not really , said mr blatter , who lives in manhattan a very small percentage of listeners go out and dance to the stuff it s nothing i would do on a saturday night after almost two months of broadcasting , there are no figures on how many people are tuning in to y107 , and mr blatter was reluctant to make an estimate before the stations changed format the audiences combined were approximately a quarter of a million , he said we expect to do at least that and significantly better than that there is also the issue of how to position advertisers one recent commercial had a man selling cars for a dealership in lakeland , nj , hardly an effective appeal for listeners in east hampton , peekskill or stamford mr blatter said there used to be a bias against country music by advertisers , but since the music now reaches a contemporary audience advertisers are using the station he compared the seemingly uneconomical offering by advertisers of new jersey cars to drivers in connecticut to the practice of politicians who spend money reaching listeners who cannot vote for them in order to be able to address a target audience that might be mixed in with the other listeners jason steinberg , director of marketing and promotions for the station , said , country music fans are the most passionate and loyal audience in radio he said a few people complained when the rock format was dropped and the interim television music was put on , but since then , he added , more than 2 , 000 people have sent email messages endorsing the change not the burns family of chappaqua , however , which was happy with the old format i can understand changing a radio format for business purposes , mrs burns said but in that vein the heads of 1071 are just not thinking then again there is point of view of one listener , the television show host and comedian david letterman , who broadcasts his show from the west side of manhattan and lives in connecticut talking on the air with the country singer dwight yoakam last month , mr letterman said he was too lazy to change his presets on his radio and had become addicted to that country music on y107
kate wittenberg had a problem as editor in chief of the columbia university press , she wanted to continue publishing the books that make scholarly work available and help young professors win tenure but , like all university press executives , she was faced with the reality that libraries were buying fewer and fewer books as their budgets shrank she also knew that universities were less and less willing to absorb big losses from university presses her solution publish scholarly work on line not just journal articles , but whole books , books that colleges might take into account in their tenure decisions , just as if they had been printed and bound this week , columbia university plans to announce the establishment of a new web site , columbia international affairs online \( which goes by the acronym ciao \) , that will publish everything from journal articles and working papers to whole books and the proceedings of conferences in the field of international affairs and ms wittenberg is looking into similar online ventures in other fields i feel very , very passionately that we should not abandon scholars or scholarly publishing , she said it s really come down to a choice of , do you give up , and say 'we ca n't publish this anymore' or do you look to technology to help solve a crisis in scholarly publishing and in libraries \? ms wittenberg , 39 , said she started worrying about making the economics of scholarly publishing work when she started her job five years ago with the help of a 360 , 000 grant from the andrew w mellon foundation , she conducted market research with professors , librarians and other potential users she found that many literature professors said they were just learning to use email science professors said that publishers like john wiley and reed elsevier were already putting journal articles on line but political scientists were both computerliterate and hungry for timely information on line international affairs is an area where there are all sorts of things happening , and speed and timeliness of information are key elements in decision making , both for policy decisions and investment decisions , said lincoln ellis , project editor for ciao ciao offers a free demonstration \( at http www ciaonet org \) but will be fully available \( at https www1 columbia edu sec dlc ciao \) only by subscription to universities , libraries and other institutions for annual fees ranging from about 600 to 1 , 200 ciao will begin with about 10 , 000 pages , including work from brookings , the cato institute , harvard s center for international affairs , the london school of economics , and more than three dozen other institutes around the world initially , ciao will include the texts of 12 books , 6 that columbia university press has already printed and 6 that it is printing simultaneously , but none yet that are being published only on the internet some professors on an advisory board for the project say they are excited by the prospect of so much timely material at their fingertips this is the bargain of the century , said steven weber , a professor of political science at the university of california at berkeley , who said berkeley plans to buy the service do you know how many books you can buy and get shelved for 1 , 200 \? not very many ms wittenberg hopes that books will be published exclusively on line as universities express their willingness to take such work seriously she said columbia and some other universities are beginning to discuss whether to officially endorse electronically published work i think that will be a key to getting this thing going , she said she added that all work on the web site would be vetted before posting books will be peerreviewed , just as they are for regular publication conference papers and working papers will be posted if they are associated with institutions approved by columbia university press and its advisory board , without being refereed individually online books will be available by request on paper within weeks but by not having to predict sales , ms wittenberg said , the press would save printing and storage costs
mariano rivera sat by himself at a buffet table in the clubhouse , looking exactly like a closer who had just failed at his job rivera jabbed at his food , stared at a can of soda and looked perplexed he should be another ninth inning turned into a fiasco for the yankees last night and rivera was to blame jim leyritz turned his return visit to yankee stadium into a homecoming with a twoout , tworun double in the ninth inning that catapulted the angels to a 65 triumph over the yankees and doomed rivera to another depressing evening of staring at his food for answers he found none it s still there , said rivera , after finally venturing to his locker i have n't thrown the ball bad the speed is there things are n't going great right now indeed by mishandling a game they once led by 41 and 53 , the yankees \( 58 \) have now lost three straight games to sputter to three games under 500 for the first time since july 22 , 1995 rivera is trying to replace john wetteland as the closer , but his predecessor was 43 for 47 in save opportunities last season and the new closer has botched 3 of 6 chances in the first 13 games it is a poor imitation so far the yankees , who were 861 when they led after eight innings last season , are 53 in that situation so far and they have lost six games in which they led or were tied after the seventh has anyone seen wetteland \? we 're struggling , said manager joe torre , who has no plans to remove rivera from the closer spot the whole team is struggling , not only mariano we do this thing together we sink or swim as a team we 're a long way from sinking but the yankees sank fast again and leyritz , the former yankee hero , helped submerge them with a 54 lead built on mark whiten s threerun homer and on another homer by tino martinez , rivera yielded a oneout single to the pinchhitter jack howell and dave hollins smacked a sharp single to center field in the ninth rivera rebounded to whiff cleanup hitter tim salmon for the second out with an 01 count on leyritz , rivera wanted to unleash a slider on the outside corner and then come back with another fastball leyritz , who said he was looking for a fastball all the way after catching rivera last season , managed to stroke the ball into leftcenter field for the gamewinning tworun double he looks the same , leyritz said he threw hard most of the time , he s going to get you out he threw a slider down the middle i was able to speed up my bat and get it leyritz , who has all 3 of his homers and 6 of his 10 runs batted in against the yankees , also hammered a slider for a 3run homer off atlanta s mark wohlers that helped new york tie game 4 of the world series and eventually win it but torre did not question his closer for eschewing his 96mileanhour fastball i ca n't quarrel with the pitch , torre said if he puts it in the right location , it s a good pitch besides , torre lamented the missed opportunities the yankees stranded five in the first two innings off chuck finley and 10 in the game david wells \( six and twothirds innings , three runs , nine hits \) pitched decently in his debut at the stadium and said he wants rivera in any of his starts but last night was not the night to be rivera just watching him falter on the mound and then fiddle with his food proved that it will change it will change , rivera said over and over i think sooner or later , hopefully sooner , i will be out of this thing and be ok inside pitch manager joe torre was ejected by the plate umpire brian o'nora for arguing a questionable strike call to bernie williams and he blasted back after the game he s protected , torre said a manager does n't do his job and he gets fired a player does n't do his job and he gets traded , released or sent to the minors an umpire does n't do his job and he packs his bag and goes to the next city general manager bob watson spoke with scott boras , williams s agent , yesterday , but it is not believed that the yankees have made the center fielder a proposal beyond the fouryear , 24 million offer from the spring i 'd say that it s a good sign that we 're still talking , said watson , who said boras s deadline of last night is not shared by the yankees watson said he is busy trying to make us a better team , and that includes pursuing rolando arrojo , the cuban pitcher , who becomes available today arrojo , who turns 33 next month and is not 28 as has been suggested , has been described by some officials as a third or fourth starter for most teams darryl strawberry \( fluid on left knee \) will take batting practice in tampa , fla , today the yankees start a sixgame trip today in milwaukee , where snow flurries are possible photo jim leyritz , the former yankee catcher , slugging a tworun , twoout double in the ninth inning to lift the angels to a 65 victory last night \( mary dibiase blaich for the new york times \)
like a spurned bride who decides that cohabitation is better than solitude , the financially troubled newyork historical society , after six years of failed attempts to join permanently with several new york city cultural institutions , last month quietly signed an agreement to affiliate its library with new york university under the terms of the agreement , which the society and the university both call a collaboration , nyu will catalogue and preserve the society s vast collections of manuscripts , photographs , prints , architectural records and books , which on their own constitute one of the largest private libraries in the country the arrangement to rescue the library , much of which is in poor condition , is the final bandaid the society has put in place to stabilize itself after nearly shutting down in the early 90 s it follows a 75million grant from the luce foundation for restoration of art and artifacts and their installation in a new permanent gallery , as well as 15 million in emergency work on its sprawling classical building at 77th street and central park west , a landmark that had been showing as much deterioration as many of the books and objects inside for an institution that in recent years has been noted as much for the extent of its financial and administrative woes as for the strength of its collections its problems have even been chronicled in a new , booklength study , the newyork historical society lessons from one nonprofit s long struggle for survival , by kevin m guthrie the society has come a long way in the last three years its survival no longer seems in jeopardy , and its daytoday affairs are under the supervision of a strong administrator , betsy gotbaum , who served as new york city parks commissioner under mayor david n dinkins and joined the society in 1994 still , the longterm financial picture is far from healthy this unusual hybrid institution one part museum , one part library and historical archive operates on a barebones budget of 52 million a year , no more than what it spent to maintain a skeleton staff from early 1993 to mid1995 , when the society s economic situation was so desperate that it closed its doors to the public and stopped mounting exhibitions today it has an endowment of approximately 22 million , 16 million of which came from the proceeds of a controversial sale of works that included old master paintings that sale , through sotheby s , raised questions in the museum world , since the society admitted it intended to use the proceeds not to buy more works of art , as museum protocols direct when objects are deaccessioned , but to keep itself solvent quite literally living off the family jewels now , though the society s financial condition may be best described as serious , it is no longer desperate the galleries are open on a limited basis and the three remedies the luce grant to restore the collections , the emergency work on the building and the new nyu affiliation respond to the institution s most urgent shortterm needs but they only begin to prepare the it for the 21st century a home library writ large although the library contains one of the preeminent collections of historical material in the nation , the society s chief treasure , only about 30 percent of the 650 , 000 books , two million manuscripts , 15 , 000 maps and atlases and 10 , 000 newspapers are catalogued at all , ms gotbaum said , and even fewer electronically cataloguing stopped altogether two years ago , she said our one cataloguer moved away , and we have no funds to replace her carlton rochell , dean of nyu s libraries , likens the organization of the society s library to a home library writ large say you 've got a few thousand books in your apartment , he said when you want to find one , like the poetry anthology with the blue cover , you know it s in the second bedroom well , that s the way it works at the society because most of the librarians have been there for years , their own memories are often enough to find books but i think about the fact that none of us will be around forever , dr rochell said , and we need access to these collections to be instantaneous and universal under the arrangement , the society s collections will be made accessible both to library users and through the internet via nyu s electronic database , called bobcat plus , which is considered one of the most technologically advanced library cataloguing systems in the country the work is expected to take five years , the term of the society s agreement with nyu it is budgeted at roughly 56 million , which the university and the society expect to pay through a foundation grant it will bring one immediate benefit to the public the library , which has been open only three days a week since the 193yearold society descended into a fiscal and administrative abyss in 1992 , will move to a fiveday schedule the arrangement with nyu is the second try at forging ties with the university that earlier attempt fell apart three years ago , amid accusations from public officials that the objectrich , cashpoor historical society was virtually ceding to nyu many of its most precious assets this time the society is calling more of the shots
jerusalem , march 12 piles of garbage line the road to a palestinian village in east jerusalem where narrow , worn streets wind by stone houses clinging to rocky hillsides villagers live as many as six to a room , there is no sewage system or sidewalks , and classes meet in houses because the local school is too small across the valley on a pineclad hill , a planned development for jews has been designed with all the amenities of a modern suburb shopping and community centers , small businesses for local employment , schools , hotels and parks all linked to downtown jerusalem by highspeed roads bypassing arab areas the contrast between the village , umm tuba , and the new neighborhood of 6 , 500 apartments , har homa , which was recently approved for construction by the israeli government , reflects the wide gaps in development between jerusalem s arab and jewish sections discontent over this gulf has added another dimension to the political firestorm over the decision to build the jewish neighborhood in east jerusalem , which the palestinians consider their future capital in the 30 years since israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 arabisraeli war , arabs there have been living in conditions that are a world apart from jewish neighborhoods next door in umm tuba the other day , dr naim abu teir , a local physician , recalled gathering a group of people a year and a half ago to build a makeshift youth club and daycare center out of four trailers the trailers were bulldozed about two weeks later by the israeli authorities , he said , on the ground that the villagers did not have a building permit there is no clubhouse now for the young people in umm tuba , and a soccer field built by villagers for their children is on land now designated for har homa at the foot of the hill , which palestinians call jabal abu ghneim nearly a third of the land for the har homa project was expropriated from palestinian owners in umm tuba and the neighboring west bank town of beit sahur , while the remaining twothirds was taken from jews severe israeli zoning restrictions in umm tuba limit new construction to the center of the village , after it lost more than half of its land in the 1970 s for construction of an adjacent jewish neighborhood , east talpiot two village houses built without permits have been demolished in recent years , and several homeowners have been stiffly fined and one jailed for building outside permitted areas umm tuba still does not have an approved master plan that would allow for its legal expansion similar conditions exist throughout arab neighborhoods and villages in east jerusalem , leading many palestinians to accuse israel of trying to force them to leave the city this is discrimination , dr abu teir said their aim is to remove the palestinians from east jerusalem ali abu teir , a construction worker from the same 3 , 000member clan that makes up the village , said the building curbs imposed on the village had a clear political purpose their strategic aim is to get us to move out to the west bank , he said israel has ringed arab areas of east jerusalem with jewish neighborhoods built since 1967 in an attempt to consolidate its hold on the city , which it says will remain its undivided capital about 170 , 000 jews live today in east jerusalem , next to a similar number of palestinians official documents illustrate the uneven development of arab and jewish neighborhoods there in the last 30 years since 1967 , more than a third of the area of east jerusalem has been expropriated by israel for construction of more than 40 , 000 homes solely for jews fewer than 600 apartments were built for arabs with government assistance about 60 percent of the rest of the land in east jerusalem remains unplanned , meaning that there can be no construction there about 45 percent of the planned land has been designated as open areas , where building is also forbidden and when arab building is allowed , it has been limited to one or two stories all told , arabs can live and build on about 10 percent of the land in east jerusalem the lopsided development strategies , pursued under all israeli governments , were a function of the struggle between israelis and palestinians over the future of jerusalem sarah kaminker , a former planner for the jerusalem municipality , called it political planning there has been a deliberate policy to keep the demographic balance in the city of 28 percent arabs and 72 percent jews , ms kaminker said in order to do this , you have to deny the right of the arabs to use their land the job of the planners for arab neighborhoods has been to take land out of circulation so they ca n't build on it amir cheshin , who served 10 years as an adviser on arab affairs to two mayors of jerusalem , said zoning restrictions and construction delays were in effect meant to encourage palestinians to move out of the city to neighboring towns in the west bank there were technical and bureaucratic delays for political reasons , he said a 1994 municipal report commissioned by the current mayor , ehud olmert , found vast inequalities between the jewish and arab parts of the city that included inadequate garbage collection and lack of sewage systems in parts of east jerusalem , inferior roads and school buildings and a serious housing shortage because of building restrictions to show that it is remedying these inequities even as it approved the project in har homa , the israeli government said it had also approved building for the arab population in jerusalem of about 3 , 000 housing units but the government will not in fact build homes instead , it approved money for roads in east jerusalem near which some 3 , 000 dwellings could be built privately by arabs , according to official estimates this potential construction must still clear major bureaucratic hurdles , including approval of plans and receipt of building permits the last big expropriation of land in east jerusalem for a jewish neighborhood , pisgat zeev , in 1980 , was also coupled with a promise to allow arab construction in the adjacent area of beit hanina but during 17 years of of delays , plans for 18 , 000 apartments there were gradually reduced to 7 , 500 , and none have been built last week 29 people from umm tuba and beit sahur petitioned israel s supreme court to block the construction at har homa , arguing that it reflected a dual planning regime that discriminated between jews and arabs regardless of the outcome of the legal battle , the harsh political dispute over the new neighborhood has demonstrated that large israeli building projects in east jerusalem can no longer be pursued freely at a time when israel and the palestinians are in a process of negotiation previous practice no longer works , said daniel seidemann , a lawyer representing the umm tuba villagers who monitors israeli building policies in east jerusalem for the peace now movement the rules of the game in jerusalem are changing photo umm tuba , a crowded palestinian village in east jerusalem , has lost part of its land for a new jewish neighborhood raida abu

hong kong , jan 27 the bristlehaired shipping tycoon chosen by beijing to run hong kong when 150 years of british colonial rule fade away at the end of june was searching for a place to organize his new government size , location and view all mattered , of course but more important , indeed most important , was the imprimatur of a feng shui master seemingly eager to please , the colonial government , which has been openly hostile to many of china s plans for hong kong , offered up a suite of offices atop one of the glitziest malls in the central business district the leadertobe , tung cheehwa , turned them down flat so , mr tung bustled about town , very secretly , before settling on two floors in what is called the asia pacific finance center , a mirrored semicylinder joined at the hip to the citicorp tower within slingshot distance of the jaggedly angular bank of china headquarters despite the expansive views , the private elevator and the central location , mr tung turned first to a master of feng shui \( pronounced fung shway \) , the chinese art of harmonizing people and their environment , to analyze the balance of light and dark in the offices , the orientation of windows and doors , the angle of his desk feng shui is something you cannot refuse to believe in , mr tung declared after receiving the master s approval only after the feng shui expert nods his head to a place do i feel comfortable indeed , mr tung had made it clear even before he was selected in december to be hong kong s first chief executive under chinese rule that he would not move into government house , the cavernous 19thcentury edifice , somewhat resembling a provincial railroad station , where gov chris patten lives and works i 've heard that government house is crowded and the feng shui is not good , mr tung informed the gaggle of local journalists who trail him relentlessly feng shui , literally wind and water , is as central to hong kong s ethos as making money , eating and shopping houses are built only after consultations with geomancers to insure propitious orientation with the landscape funerals are often scheduled , deals struck and investments made only after the seal of approval from a feng shui practitioner when wellen sham , a leading businessman , tours hong kong looking for sites for his new supermarkets , feng shui is at the top of the list of his concerns i have a feng shui master who accompanies me when i inspect sites , mr sham told the south china morning post there s always the question of feng shui the advice and benediction of feng shui masters are sought widely , and in virtually any situation one of hong kong s leading tycoons , li kashing , rescheduled his mother s funeral when a feng shui expert suggested a more appropriate time and when a number of riders at hong kong s newly renovated happy valley race track tumbled from their steeds , a welter of jockeys and trainers demanded that feng shui experts be summoned to assess the track s harmony problems to be sure , not everyone here regards feng shui with such solemnity for the last five years , credit lyonnais securities asia has published what it calls its feng shui index , a wry and irreverent assessment of hong kong s prospects and opportunities for investors with last year s index predicting a fire at governor patten s home \( there was n't one \) , a fatal hurricane \( it was among the calmest years in memory \) , an airplane disaster \( none at all \) and a dismal year on the stock market \( new highs have been the rule \) , the index , gleaned from the wisdom of various feng shui experts , has been struggling to find its feet and even the best feng shui does not insure unclouded horizons the sculptured twin glass towers owned by the lippo group

from being caught in a spreading web of allegations over improper campaign contributions to the democratic party in the united states for his part , though , mr tung has cast his lot with the feng shui master choy paklai mr choy , who was hired specifically by the government to vet the offices chosen by mr tung , said he was reassured by the layout of the asiapacific site at the same time , he was troubled by the british governor s offices , offices he urged mr tung not to take over government house , said mr choy , referring to governor patten s home and office , was surrounded by tall buildings , which blocked its spirit other feng shui experts were less sanguine about mr tung s choice lee chiksan , another local geomancer , was unsettled by the view of construction sites buildings with inauspiciously sharp triangular and rectangular shapes from the future chief executive s office if the dragon cannot see his office , then he will be in trouble , cautioned mr lee in the cosmology of feng shui , it is thought that a mythical dragon reigns at the heart of hong kong , exerting influence over all that happens mr patten s spokesman , kerry mcglynn , was unruffled by suggestions that spiritual and natural forces were in disharmony at government house the feng shui ca n't be all that bad , mr mcglynn said when the governor moved in , the hang seng stock exchange

when nelson demille put the hero of his latest novel , plum island , in a fiberglass speedboat in the middle of peconic bay during a hurricane , he decided to make the boat s fuel tank nearly empty , its twoway radio missing and its cell phone dead today s hightech communications and transportation have made it harder to write electrifying narratives , said mr demille , the author of nine best sellers , including the gold coast and the charm school , and whose plum island today is at the top of the new york times bestseller list the world has gotten smaller and more accessible since i first started writing in the 70 s , mr demille said in an interview in his garden city home everybody is in touch by cell phones helicopters have opened up places that were once inaccessible you have to go out of your way as a suspense novelist to find situations where the protagonists are somewhat helpless and in real danger mr demilleknows what having your life on the line feels like in 1966 , he left hofstra university to enlist in the army and served with the first calvary division in vietnam the division was later immortalized in francis ford coppola s 1979 film , apocalypse now mr demille returned to vietnam in february he revisited the battlefield where he had been in 1968 during the tet offensive , when the north vietnamese and the vietcong broke a truce by simultaneously attacking 100 south vietnamese cities but the former first lieutenant found the sense of menace had completely gone you looked around and you said , 'i'm in the middle of nowhere' but you really were n't , he said there was a hotel right down the street there was no danger he said that of late , good settings for suspense plots had been harder to find middleclass americans , like his heroes , cannot be wholly lost or endangered anywhere on the globe you can manufacture some dangers , i suppose , by going to the antarctic , and you can still die there if you 're stupid enough , he said but if you 're in the amazon and you have a cell phone , you can call for help there is no terra incognito left , he added basically the world is wellmapped there are no undiscovered islands but while plum island , just northeast of orient point , is not undiscovered , it remains a mysterious place to east end boaters and ferry passengers traveling across the long island sound except for government workers who come by chartered ferries , no one is permitted on the island once the possession of the army , plum island now belongs to the united states department of agriculture and is the site of one of two usda centers for animal disease control with water on all sides , scientists can safely study animal diseases like hoofandmouth disease and african swine fever not found on the north american continent research takes place in airtight containment laboratories that require special dress and decontamination procedures for entry and exit but to further insure that no bacteria or virus escape into the environment , particularly to mainland america , visits by the public are by special arrangement only this restricted access has contributed to stories of experiments in biological warfare on plum island after world war ii such allegations have no basis in fact , according to usda officials still rumors persist that when the army left in 1954 , the work of studying animal diseases with potential for mass human infection was passed on to the usda in his new novel , mr demille uses these local myths to create an intriguing environment for the murder of two young , attractive modernday scientists employed on plum island before their death , tom and judy gordon had befriended the book s narrator , john corey , who is on the north fork convalescing from bullet wounds suffered as a detective on duty on new york city streets corey recognizes that the explanation for the murders publicized by the local authorities is too pat he follows his veteran detective instincts in a private investigation on the day they were murdered , for example , the gordons playfully flew the jolly roger from the yardarm on their lawn but corey intuits that the flag s double meaning of pirates and poisonous material is no joke mr demille spent part of last summer on the north fork , where he wrote nearly half of plum island while his characters live in rambling turnofthecentury farm houses or restored victorians facing the water , the author said he preferred his worryfree contemporary rental on paradise point in southold township i did n't have to do anything but turn on the a c , he said there was no gardening to do , and there was a pool his wife , ginny , stayed in garden city during the week to manage her book store , which left mr demille with long days of isolation and writing if your mate is with you , you feel like , 'i guess i should be talking to this person , ' he said but when they 're not there and you 're really being good and keeping out of trouble , you can actually sit from about 10 in the morning and pace yourself with coffee and walks and work until 10 or 11 at night clearly the ambience of the north fork crept into the writer s consciousness corey describes the sunsets over the sound and the sprawling farmlands stretching out in the serenity of late summer
for a generation that grew up with home pregnancy tests , compatibility quizzes and doityourself sat preparation kits , one of the newest home tests may seem inevitable an iq test for the children with the children s iq and achievement test , a small massachusetts software company says it has created the first cdrom test designed to let any parent measure a child s aptitude and achievement right at home in a time of parental anxiety about whether schools can properly identify children s needs and talents , the company feels there is a ripe market for such a test , though education experts and psychologists question whether home testing will do more harm than good prudence eiland of hanford , calif , bought a test as a christmas gift for her 5 and 9yearold sons both of them took the test enthusiastically and their scores , mrs eiland said , were pretty much what she expected high i believe my children are extremely bright in interesting ways , said mrs eiland , who runs a financial consulting business with her husband but it s nice to know as a parent that what you believe emotionally can be quantified since last fall , the company , based in needham , mass , has shipped 20 , 000 units of the test 10 , 000 that were designed for children in kindergarten through third grade and 10 , 000 for children in fourth through sixth grade next month , it will begin shipping a version for children in grades seven through nine we always hear that when parents are involved kids do better , said david blohm , president of virtual entertainment , the test s creator this enables parents to get involved in an informed way and on a more regular basis the test was created , mr blohm said , after some of the 26 , 000 buyers of a 1994 iq test on cdrom for adults kept asking where they could find the children s version the test was written by proed , a company in austin , tex , that publishes educational products for psychologists , speech pathologists and teachers iq tests have long been the targets of heated debate , with opponents arguing that the tests are culturally biased and therefore unreliable proed said it gave sample cdrom tests to children who represented a crosssection of socioeconomic groups to come up with its average score the test does not score above 130 or below 70 , and the average score is 90 to 110 for 3995 parents get the cdrom and an 80page manual that tells them some of the theories about testing \( there are many ways to look at a child \) , how to deal with the results \( do not consider them definitive and use them constructively \) and how to administer it \( the iq portion only once a year , the achievement test once every six months \) despite the cautions offered in the cdrom manual , some educators and psychologists \( none of whom had seen the cdrom version of the test \) expressed concern that any iq test administered and interpreted at home by parents might do a child more harm than good tests are just tools not good or bad in and of themselves , but they can have bad effects , said david elkind , a professor of child development at tufts university in medford , mass children can be mislabeled early and bear that label for the rest of their academic career barbara kiefer , associate professor of reading and children s literature at columbia university s teacher s college , said we already overrely on test scores as a measure of progress this kind of increases the testtaking frenzy instead , we need to expand the way we look at kids dianne brown , director of testing and assessment at the american psychological association , a trade association for psychologists , said i do n't like this notion of take this home and put a label on your child these tests are criticized horribly even when being used appropriately in the school system but bryan bryant , president of proed , which wrote the test , argued nobody knows more about a child than the parent does and yet so often at school the parent is a recipient rather than a contributor of information about their child this can provide another perspective the cdrom tests contain lots of sound effects and animation , intended to make them fun in the version for the youngest grade levels , a character called mr stripes the skunk cheerfully welcomes testtakers to brainville all three age levels get three test sections an aptitude test that can include listening comprehension , symbolic reasoning and analogies , which produces the iq score an achievement section of mathematics , vocabulary , reading comprehension , spelling and usage , and a games section to sharpen skills in the listening comprehension section for kindergartners , the child is asked if a puppy is a dog the child clicks on yes or no necklaces on a pig and a duck can such repeated iq testing at home help put a child on the right track to a stellar college \?

mount laurel , nj , april 11 planning officials in this prosperous suburb in southern new jersey approved a rental complex of 140 town houses for low and moderateincome families early today , culminating a 26year legal battle that turned mount laurel into a national symbol of suburbs that used their zoning laws to exclude the poor the project , to be built on 63 acres of farmland , will be named for ethel r lawrence , who brought the original complaint after township officials rejected a proposal from her and a group of other black residents to use federal subsidies to build 38 garden apartments the unanimous vote by the board came after midnight , and after more than 200 opponents of the plan , fearful of increased taxes , crime and devalued property , had peppered the developers and board members with derisive taunts and angry threats in the speeches of many of the opponents in this township 21 miles east of philadelphia , there was a sense that the planning board vote would usher in the same urban ills that they had fled years before you 're history , shouted jacob herman , one of the leaders of a group of opponents from a senior citizens development across the road from the proposed town houses , as he gestured toward board members , the mayor and members of the township council but for peter o'connor and carl bisgaier , the lawyers who undertook the lawsuit 26 years ago ethel halley , the daughter of mrs lawrence , and mayor peter r mccaffrey , there was another sense of history in that moment , growing out of the landmark ruling in the legal battle minutes after the vote , mayor mccaffrey walked up to mr o'connor and ms halley , who now head the nonprofit development company that will build the housing , stretched out his hand and said , welcome to mount laurel the contrast could not have been sharper with the words of his predecessor back in 1970 according to historians of the fight here , bill haines , who was then mayor , went to the small black church attended by many of those who were seeking approval for their lowincome housing proposal to deliver the town s response the answer was no , and then he added , if you people ca n't afford to live in our town , then you 'll just have to move the ninemember planning board had been under a state court order to evaluate the housing proposal only in light of whether it complied with local ordinances they had little room to turn it down , even in the face of vocal opposition from residents of neighboring subdivisions , where homes range in price from 150 , 000 to 400 , 000 according to census bureau data , more than 30 , 000 people lived in mount laurel in 1990 , about 3 percent of them black race , though , was never directly mentioned in the hearings on this latest proposal mayor mccaffrey later praised the sponsors of the housing for their calm amid the emotions surrounding the proposal but knowing the history , it was inevitable that this was going to come , he said i'm happy it s over , and i'm sure that the people who move in will be good citizens and will be accepted mr o'connor and ms halley said they were proud of the board members for the message of support their unanimous vote sent they were particularly pleased , they said , with two of the board members who expressed unequivocal support for the plan as right and only fair it s taken us more than 25 years to bring about a fundamental change in the relationship between the suburbs and the cities in america , mr o'connor said the unanimous vote by the mount laurel planning board indicates that a new day in affordable housing in the nation is dawning ms halley said the vote had lifted a weight for her after the years of watching her mother fight local officials over housing and become a target for racist taunts and threats , she applauded the courage that board members had shown in overturning past actions , particularly in the face of an angry crowd gathered in the auditorium of the harrington middle school i appreciate what they have gone through because people can be cruel , she said , as she sat with two of her sisters after the vote but i'm not sure whether more than a few of them appreciate what we have been through the vote will allow fair share housing development inc , the nonprofit developer , to meet the april 31 deadline for applying for the scarce federal tax credits that are crucial to the financing of the 15 million project there had been some fears among supporters of the development that the planning board , which usually holds a single hearing on a project but had allowed three public hearings on this one , might again delay a vote mr o'connor said the company could begin construction by the end of the year , if the tax credits are awarded the tax credits are awarded to such projects on a competitive basis the planning board , in an apparent acknowledgment of some of the specific complaints of opponents or in a facesaving move , did impose about a dozen conditions on their approval of the plan but they were carefully worded in recognition that they often exceeded the actual authority of the board and might run afoul of the order from the supreme court that town officials had to judge the plan on its compliance with local ordinances and state law , not their personal preferences
sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina , july 16 the bosnian serb authorities are threatening widespread retaliation against nato soldiers if they try to make further arrests of war crime suspects , united nations officials said today an american soldier was slightly wounded today by a man wielding a sickle , in the latest of several incidents that followed the arrest last thursday of a bosnian serb charged with war crimes a second suspect was killed in a shootout with nato forces nato officers have privately warned the bosnian serb authorities that they will respond militarily if the serbs retaliate against the international force in bosnia but the officers say they are deliberately leaving vague the question of precisely what circumstances would trigger a nato reaction , and what form it would take in their public statements , bosnian serb leaders have denounced the arrests , but at the same time they have urged people not to retaliate news coverage and commentaries on statecontrolled bosnian serb television and radio , on the other hand , have been inflammatory news broadcasts call the nato action illegal and , in a message calculated to generate widespread antipathy toward nato , suggest that any man who served in the bosnian serb army during the war that ended a year and a half ago could be subject to arrest in fact , only the handful of people indicted by the war crimes tribunal in the hague face apprehension the american soldier who was attacked today is part of a team of about 10 soldiers based in the town of vlasenica the soldiers' job , an army spokesman said , is to maintain contact with bosnian serb military units nearby the spokesman said the soldier had been investigating a suspicious noise outside his quarters early this morning when he was attacked army spokesmen declined to identify the wounded soldier , but the bosnian serb police said he was roberto ducato since sunday there have been three attacks aimed at international organizations none of the others caused injuries the first , in the city of zvornik , was a large explosive charge detonated under a pickup truck belonging to the organization for security and cooperation in europe there have been two smaller explosions , one detonated near the car of a united nations police monitor , and the other near the home of an election monitor while saying they are not sure that there is a coordinated campaign against them , foreign organizations are telling their workers to avoid unnecessary movement in public and to be very watchful after increasing their alert status on friday , nato forces returned to normal by tuesday pamphlets threatening attacks on nato forces have appeared in several towns one pamphlet says , somalia was too gentle , in a reference to the killing of 18 army rangers in somalia after they sought to arrest the leader of one of the factions there a united nations official said the police had been seen distributing the pamphlets in the town of doboj apart from the nato forces , the largest international group in the serbianheld half of bosnia is the united nations police monitors , numbering about 800 many of them are americans there are about 200 other foreigners who regularly work for international agencies in bosnian serb territory the threats by the bosnian serb authorities are a familiar tactic , one that has proved successful in the past the bosnian serbs were able to stop air strikes against them in 1995 by taking united nations peacekeepers hostage fear of retaliation often crippled the peacekeeping mission here , turning western countries against each other in bitter debates over how to respond to the threats and allowing bosnian serb forces to defy united nations resolutions until last week the prospect of retaliation against nato soldiers or international organizations was used as an argument against arresting war crime suspects the serbs are very good at this game , a senior united nations official here said they know they can promise to cooperate , but then someone throws a grenade here or makes a small attack there , and it all keeps the pressure up it can keep the international community off guard a western official who works in the bosnian serb area said he , like many others , was surprised that there had not been more attacks but he said that if the bosnian serb leadership decided to change its tactics and put more pressure on the west , the situation could suddenly become very dangerous for him as well as anyone else working for an international agency here map of yugoslavia highlighting vlasenica an american soldier was wounded by an assailant in vlasenica

for several years , federal officials have pointed proudly to an antisweatshop program that relies on apparel companies to police factories as a model of governmentindustry cooperation and as a way to reassure consumers that the clothes they buy are not made by exploited workers but over the last few days , several raids by california officials have dealt that program a serious setback by uncovering immigrants doing illegal piecework at home for several companies that are covered by the federal initiative in one of the largest crackdowns over the past year , california s labor inspectors found sewing machines and bags of garments at five homes in the los angeles area , where the residents engaged in the longbanned practice of doing homework for apparel companies these raids , along with government reports and interviews with workers , point to serious problems in the fastgrowing voluntary program in which federal officials have tried to compensate for a shortage of government inspectors by pushing large apparel companies to monitor the factories with which they have contracts union officials and many garment workers assert that selfmonitoring is not working , insisting that many private monitors do shoddy inspections or ignore violations it s the fox guarding the chicken coop , said edna bonacich , a sociology professor at the university of california at riverside , who is writing a book on california s garment industry in the los angeles garment district , a gritty sprawl of warehouses and tuckedaway factories , factory owners say the competition is so cutthroat that they often have to cut corners to survive they say they have been whipsawed by rising costs , specifically california s new 5anhour minimum wage , and by falling revenue , resulting from companies' paying rockbottom prices and from competition from lowwage mexican factories they complain that they are paid 4 to make a pair of jeans that might retail for 50 before this week s raids , california s inspectors found out about the illegal homework through a tip from the apparel union , the union of needletrades , industrial and textile employees , known as unite some of the illegal homework was done for factories that make clothes for guess \? inc , the jeans maker , which unite is pressuring to use unionized factories only none of the homework was being done on guess garments , state officials said industrial homework was banned in the early 1940 s when federal officials concluded that it was too hard to regulate and that it led to widespread abuses of minimum wage , overtime and childlabor laws in 1992 , guess became the first apparel maker to sign a selfpolicing agreement with the federal government , pledging to monitor all the factories that make its garments more than 100 large manufacturers have now signed such agreements responding to the raids , bill barnes , a guess spokesman , said the company was pleased that none of the homework was being done on guess garments the raid indicates that our monitoring program is effective , mr barnes said but union officials said that if guess s monitoring was truly effective , its contractors would not be doing illegal homework , for guess or for anyone else monitoring is one of the most pressing issues in the apparel industry today a main issue facing the white house task force on sweatshops is just how independent monitors should be when they inspect apparel factories at home and abroad pointing to the experience in los angeles , the nation s largest garment manufacturing center , unions and human rights groups assert that monitors should be as independent as possible many of the shortcomings of selfmonitoring are evident in 1 , 500 pages of inspection reports , prepared by guess monitors , that were obtained by lawyers representing garment workers who have sued guess and its contractors , charging them with millions of dollars in wage violations the reports , which unite made available to the new york times , make possible a case study of how well the selfmonitoring initiative is working the reports trace guess s monitoring since 1992 , when it agreed to selfpolicing to help settle a federal investigation that found largescale wage and childlabor violations by guess contractors daniel petrocelli , a lawyer for guess , said , this voluntary policing mechanism that guess pioneered has become the model for the country acknowledging that violations continue at some shops , mr petrocelli added , it is impossible to have a completely violationfree environment in this industry or any other the reports show that over a fouryear period guess monitors found repeated violations at three factories with the same owner pride jeans , price jeans and price fashions in may 1993 , an inspector reported , this shop needs to be watched very carefully because it has the tendency of cheating employees very easily the next month , an inspector found that many workers did not punch timecards or receive overtime when they worked more than eight hours in march 1994 , an inspector found 160 employees working , but just 113 clocked in in june 1994 , like the previous june , monitors found that the company did not pay overtime after eight hours of work in february 1996 , an inspector reported that something is 'fishy' with pride s payroll methods despite this monitoring , last november federal inspectors found that pride had failed to pay 135 , 06703 in overtime to 146 workers steven lai , pride s president , did not return a telephone call seeking his response
majdal shams , golan heights , sept 1 at the entrance to this mountain village , charred tires speak of an anger that is welling once again among the druse in their israeliheld lands most of the 18 , 000 druse in the golan live here , just a shout away from syria , to which they are bound by history and blood but since israel captured the heights in the 1967 war , it has permitted only a few to venture back across the border , and now one of the most admired among them , a 32yearold woman , has been taken away by israeli plainclothesmen and accused of being a syrian spy the arrest may have been merely the latest in what many druse say amounts to three decades of israeli indignities but in the apple orchards that spill down the golan s rocky slopes , and particularly in the homes whose residents had begun to dare to display the syrian flag , what happened to the woman , ilham abu saleh , is seen as a warning sign this is directed at all of us , said kalim abu saleh , 27 , who shared an apartment with his sister in damascus and says he is certain of her innocence at his home in majdal shams , where a photograph of president hafez alassad of syria hangs in the living room , mr abu saleh said angrily , i think that the israelis are trying to force all of us to think twice the young woman s relatives are by no means the only ones to have turned belligerent after she was taken from her family home in the early hours of aug 24 , residents built barricades to keep the israeli authorities away and staged a raucous daylong protest that served as a reminder that discontent with israeli rule extends beyond the usual focal points of the west bank and gaza i'm a syrian , so of course i'm prosyrian , said fouzi abu jaber , who was born in majdal shams 45 years ago , long before israel captured the golan mr abu jaber spent 10 years in an israeli jail convicted , he said with pointed irony , of spying for the enemy and now he is among the leaders of a community group , the academic association of the golan heights , that has helped to keep that national consciousness alive the druse religion is an offshoot of islam , and the world s 15 million druse are both arabs and muslims most have proven fiercely patriotic in their allegiance the 500 , 000 druse in syria are staunchly antiisrael , while in the galilee area of israel , the 90 , 000 druse who live there have taken israeli citizenship and even in the golan , whose total population of about 34 , 000 includes some 16 , 000 israelis , some have cast their lot with israel , including salim shufi , the israeliappointed mayor of majdal shams , who is a former officer in the israeli army but most of the druse have resisted israeli attempts at assimilation , choosing instead to heed a longstanding sense of loyalty to syria in majdal shams , nearly everyone in the village has relatives on the other side of the long border fence , some of them just across a valley where , when the wind is right and lungs are strong , people on either side shout their news back and forth once that was the only means of communication between the druse in syria and those who found themselves in territory now called israel , since israel formally annexed the golan 16 years ago now there are longdistance calls , at about 2 a minute and periodically , first from 1977 to 1981 , and then again since 1989 , the young and gifted among them have been permitted to make their way northward across the united nationsmonitored demilitarized zone and onward to damascus , the capital ms abu saleh , who joined that group in 1993 after divorcing her husband , took a degree in psychology in june at the university of damascus , where she was president of the golan druse students' association that made her a respected figure among the 300 or so golan druse who now study in syria each year , and her relatives say she had planned to return to the syrian capital to begin graduate work in classes that were to have begun this week but since her arrest , none of the students have been permitted back across the border , and some among them have begun to miss important examinations \( on wednesday , 82 druse students were permitted to cross into syria , but only after passing what israeli officials described as very strict security checks \) ms abu saleh has not yet been charged with any crime , but she remains in custody , under investigation for what israeli officials say may be serious security offenses israeli officials have suggested that she may have had a romantic relationship with sakiv abu jebil , a member of the syrian parliament , and may have provided the syrian authorities with information about local residents in israel s employ people in majdal shams say this is absurd anything that ms abu saleh knew about internal politics was known to everyone in the village , they say , and mr abu jebil is her 70yearold greatuncle syrian officials , including the rector of the university of damascus , have asked for the united nations to intervene , calling the arrest part of israel s barbaric oppression of syrian students from the golan the israeli annexation of the golan in 1981 prompted the druse to stage a sevenmonth general strike forced since then to carry israeli documents , only about 10 percent have agreed to become israelis papers issued to the others list their citizenship as undecided and after what happened last week , no one in the mayor s office or anyone else in majdal shams known to be proisraeli would agree to talk with a foreign visitor they may have been mindful of graffiti that have begun to appear on village walls a swastika with the slogan death to the collaborators photo naif abu saleh , a druse , held a portrait of his daughter , ilham , 32 , who is in israeli custody , suspected of spying for syria people in majdal shams say this is absurd president hafez alassad s picture is on the wall \( rina castelnuovo for the new york times \) map

in a discovery that offers a new way of preventing many cases of colon cancer , biologists have detected a genetic change that apparently doubles the risk of the disease the genetic change , or mutation , occurs in as many as 6 percent of people of ashkenazi jewish descent , according to preliminary studies , making it the most common known cancer gene in a particular population the mutation has not yet been found among nonashkenazis biologists at the johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore , where the mutation was found , have also developed a test to detect it the center is recommending that anyone of ashkenazi descent with a close relative who has had colon cancer should take the test , because people with a family history of the disease are at higher risk of developing it themselves the lerner foundation of cleveland is offering to pay for the test for anyone of ashkenazi descent who cannot afford it but the test is not yet available for people living in new york state , since the state department of health has not approved any laboratory to offer it ashkenazi jews are those who settled in central and eastern europe most jewish americans are of ashkenazi descent the discovery has two novel aspects it suggests , if its initial premises are confirmed , that there may be substantial medical benefits in testing a whole population group , even though this would raise risks of discrimination in jobs and insurance , and even of stigmatization second , the mutation appears to cause cancer by a completely new mechanism , a finding that may lead to the discovery of other cancercausing mutations that work in a similar way dr francis collins , director of the human genome project at the national institutes of health , described the discovery as pretty dramatic but he suggested that the mutation s significance needed to be further evaluated this is a new kind of medicine , he said , and i worry about plunging into it too quickly the public will not be amused if we overestimate the risk of this he pointed out that the risk associated with two breast cancer genes had been overestimated at first dr collins also said the finding did not mean that people of ashkenazi descent faced a greater burden of genetic disease some mutations are simply easier to find in certain populations because of what geneticists call a founder effect there is no perfect genetic specimen , dr collins said we are all flawed , we all carry 5 to 50 serious genetic misspellings that one has now been identified in ashkenazis does n't change the bottom line that we are all walking around with things that are probably a lot worse than this people who are found to carry the new mutation could have regular colonoscopies , a procedure in which doctors examine the lower intestine and at the same time remove any polyps , the slow growing , fingerlike protrusions from which colon cancer originates colonoscopies are not cheap or pleasant , but they substantially reduce the risk of colon cancer we could expect a benefit as high as 90 percent , said dr sidney winawer , meaning that at least 9 out of 10 potential cases of cancer could be averted dr winawer , an author of the new report , is an expert on familial cancer at the memorial sloankettering cancer center in manhattan if the initial figures for the frequency and risk of the mutation are confirmed , some experts believe that the test should be offered to everyone of ashkenazi jewish descent the general lifetime risk of colon cancer among this population group is 9 percent to 15 percent , but it is estimated to be twice that 18 percent to 30 percent for the 6 percent of ashkenazis who are believed to carry the mutation as a practical matter , however , the johns hopkins oncology center , the only place where the test is now available , can screen limited numbers this is one reason the test is not now being recommended more broadly the other is the need to quantify the risk better we are certainly recommending that anyone with a family history of colon cancer be tested , said dr bert vogelstein , a member of the center and a chief author on the research team that discovered the mutation in other cases , at least initially , we are leaving it up to the patients and their physicians dr vogelstein added , though , that anyone who wishes to get the test , we wo n't refuse , but i think it is an individual decision alfred lerner , whose foundation has agreed to pay for the test , said he hoped a lot of people would get the test asked how much the program might cost , he said i really do n't want to put a number on it let s just see how it plays out dr vogelstein believes that the discovery has the potential to save thousands of lives , because in the united states alone an estimated 360 , 000 people , or 6 percent of the six million ashkenazi jewish americans , carry the mutation none of these patients need to get seriously ill if they have the knowledge , he said this is a totally preventable illness
beijing , july 15 for nearly a decade , and certainly since the tiananmen square massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators in 1989 , millions of chinese have awaited the day when the country s unpopular hardline prime minister , li peng , would be forced to step down by the constitutional limit on his term now , as the end of mr li s 10 years in office approaches , it appears that the country s leading economic reformer , zhu rongji , has pulled away from the pack of contenders seeking to replace mr li on matters of political reform , mr zhu , a deputy prime minister , is as orthodox as the rest of the current communist party leadership but he is regarded as a pragmatist more willing to take risks to promote a market economy than mr li the people i talk to who are very well informed say that the decision has essentially been made , said a western banker with highlevel contacts in the party who has worked closely with mr zhu over the years a chinese official who has been promoting one of mr zhu s rivals for the job said , it seems that all the other candidates have faded into the background and a senior western diplomat said , i now do n't hear any other name but zhu of course , in the secret councils of the communist party , anything could still happen but even though a year ago the chinese capital was full of stories that mr zhu did not want the job and that other powerful figures were promoting themselves for it , a consensus has emerged around mr zhu in recent months and mr zhu now tells confidants that he wants the job the ascension of mr zhu , 69 , an economic planner , to the post of prime minister would certainly be acclaimed as a critical indicator that china s leaders , after the death of deng xiaoping this year , intend to insure that progress toward a market economy stays on track by putting its management in the hands of a pragmatic and progressive senior leader mr zhu , a former mayor of shanghai who grew up in china s centralplanning bureaucracy , became so identified with deng s reform drive in the 1980 s that some analysts began to call him china s gorbachev the appellation made mr zhu so uncomfortable and so vulnerable to criticism from hardliners that he lowered his political profile while burnishing his image as a technocratic economic manager were it not for zhu rongji , it is fair to say the reform process would have been weakened , said harry broadman , a former clinton administration economist now at the world bank , where he studies the problems of china s state industrial sector , also an obsession of mr zhu s in 1993 , mr zhu gained international prominence when he was handed the task of reining in a chinese economy so overheated that inflation was threatening to spin out of control , according to a public estimate at the time by the central intelligence agency mr li , who disappeared from the leadership in april 1993 asserting that he had a heart ailment , left to mr zhu the politically unpleasant job of cracking the whip by canceling hundreds of provincial construction projects and ending the flood of credit that staterun banks had turned loose mr zhu quickly gained a reputation as the central government s hatchet man his lack of popularity with provincial officials who were on the receiving end of his austerity campaign could still create a groundswell of political opposition in the party to his appointment , chinese officials say if mr zhu has any competition , it comes from support for li lanqing , another deputy prime minister , who supervises china s foreign trade and is regarded as an even more flexible and pragmatic economic manager than mr zhu a year ago , president jiang zemin and li peng were said to be confiding to some foreign visitors that li lan qing would be the next prime minister but such talk has all but disappeared , as has speculation that li ruihuan , another member of the party s ruling politburo , would be prime minister mr zhu s toughness is credited with having brought the chinese economy in for a soft landing while preserving robust growth after the overheating of 199395 , but by then li peng had returned to office to take much of the credit mr zhu serves as the executive deputy prime minister under mr li and holds a seat on the sevenmember standing committee of the politburo mr li is to step down formally as prime minister during the national people s congress session next march though he is losing an important power base , mr li will by no means fade away he is expected to retain his seat on the standing committee and is likely to get another prestigious position , perhaps as chairman of china s parliament , the national people s congress , or an advisory body like the chinese people s political consultative congress in speeches this summer , president jiang has signaled that china will begin a new push to reform the nation s 15 , 000 largest state industries beginning next year he recently said he would make public at the 15th party congress this fall a comprehensive strategic plan for reform , development , stability and other major issues in our country and put forward a program of action to guide our people in their efforts to press ahead with reform a forthcoming world bank study by mr broadman suggests that such a push comes none too soon the study warns that china s reforms have not tackled the core problems of the stateowned industrial sector , where half of the industries are losing money , up from onethird two years ago that , mr broadman and other economists have argued , represents a significant threat to china s banking system , which is holding a mountain of debt from state firms that cannot make money a gradual program of privatization has been under way in smaller state enterprises since late last year and is expected to be expanded to larger industries in 1998 fan gang , a leading economist at the chinese academy of social sciences , said , starting next year , reform will move more

woburn , mass , march 2 the floors are scuffed , the pool tables are secondhand , and the linoleum basketball court doubles as a bingo hall worn and well used , the boys and girls club of woburn is a beloved and central place in this gritty , bluecollar town 11 miles north of boston i was swimming in that pool when i was 9 years old , said lenny bellino , 35 , who has a 2yearold son , joe , who he hopes will be swimming in the same pool in the nottoodistant future the club depends on the loyalty of people like mr bellino , who used to work there as the physical director but these days puts in untold hours as a volunteer while he holds down two paying jobs there must be 50 to 60 dances that i 've chaperoned , hundreds of thousands of hours i 've put in , mr bellino said today as he gave a tour of the club i 've never seen even a bottle of alcohol today , with eight teenagers still hospitalized , two of them in critical condition , after overdosing on a prescription muscle relaxant at a dance at the club friday night , mr bellino was worried that the media spotlight had given the outside world a mistaken impression of the young clubgoers as a bunch of juvenile delinquents it s one unfortunate incident that happened in 32 years of the club s existence , he said these are good kids i 've never even seen one drug there like all events at the club , dances are always well chaperoned , mr bellino said mr bellino s comments were echoed across town , by other club volunteers and parents , as well as by teenagers who were at the dance lou macinanti said he still thought of the club as a safe haven for his daughter and his three sons my oldest is 17 and has been a member his whole life , and there has never been trouble like this before , he said police officers and emergency workers were summoned to the club friday night , and 14 teenagers were taken to hospitals the authorities said the victims had taken the drug baclofen , which is used to treat muscle spasms , particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis or spinal injuries from all accounts , the teenagers had no idea what to expect none of the parents of the teenagers who had taken the pills could be reached for comment but dr michael shannon , a medical toxicologist who has been treating eight of the teenagers at boston s children s hospital , said today that he had been able to speak with one of the victims she said they did n't ask what the pills were , dr shannon said and they just began to take them and take them and take them it seems like a classic example of peer pressure in that these were intelligent kids , 14 or 15 of them in a room , and someone said , 'hey , let s do this' and once one did , they all started to do it he added my experience has been that at parties , kids will take what is given to them if someone said you could smoke a bar of soap and get high , i suspect kids would try to do it the middlesex district attorney , thomas reilly , said today that the pills were part of a prescription mail order shipment delivered to the house of a woburn resident in woburn , the doors at the yellow brick club were closed today , and the scheduled swim meet canceled but mr bellino showed up anyway , just to check on things he was joined by another volunteer , dick callahan , a general contractor , who does repairs at the club the two men showed off the wall displaying the pictures of the youth of the year , and the memorial wall that is dedicated to a former club member named charles mcmahon jr , who went from woburn to the marines to vietnam , where he was killed in the war they walked through the gym , and the pool area on saturdays , with swim meets and basketball , we have 1 , 000 people in here , mr bellino said basketball tournaments draw 40 volunteers , he said a membership is an unheardof bargain 12 a year and if you ca n't pay , you get in free , mr callahan said ron hobby , who was the captain of the basketball and football teams at woburn high school 25 years ago , got his start in athletics at the boys and girls club if we did n't have the club here , i probably would be on the streets , said mr hobby , who is a member of the club s board of directors my parents were both working it was a place where i could go every afternoon mr bellino was there this evening , stripping and waxing the old floors he had heard that the board of directors would be holding a news conference there on monday , and he wanted his club to look nice

bronx prosecutors said yesterday that the shooting of a police captain last october was an act of revenge for the acquittal of officer francis x livoti in the choking death of a bronx man , and they said four members of a local gang were paid 5 , 000 for the attack after officer livoti was found not guilty in the 1994 death of anthony baez , a criminal whom prosecutors would not name offered 5 , 000 to the latin kings gang in exchange for killing a police captain , said dawn florio , an assistant district attorney in the bronx the latin kings subcontracted the work out to a smaller gang called the netas , she said , and four men carried out the plan on oct 19 by shooting capt steven plavnick in the back as he arrived at the station house of the 46th precinct in an unmarked patrol car captain plavnick did not die , but the shooters collected their fee anyway , ms florio said it was not a random thing , she said they were sending a message the contract was to kill a captain in retaliation for the acquittal of officer livoti as prosecutors made the charge in the bronx , mr livoti faced the first day of an administrative hearing at police headquarters to determine whether he used an illegal choke hold while arresting mr baez if he is found guilty , he faces the loss of his job and his pension the killing of mr baez who was asphyxiated while officer livoti was trying to arrest him and the subsequent acquittal of officer livoti led to angry demonstrations in the bronx , where relations between the police and the public were edgy to begin with many residents complained that the death of mr baez was emblematic of the police department s hostile attitude toward the city s residents that feeling was also evident at mr livoti s hearing , where members of the latin kings held a banner that said stop police brutality now while there was initial speculation that the shooting of captain plavnick was related to the livoti acquittal , the comments of ms florio and other bronx officials were the first official acknowledgment an informer led the police to four suspects , they said , and after the suspected leader was indicted last week on charges of attempted murder , assault , aggravated assault on a police officer and conspiracy , new information surfaced although officials would not say who offered the bounty for shooting captain plavnick , ms florio said the contract was passed from the latin kings to rafael almonte , reputed to be the head of the bronx netas three other people , she said , were hired for the actual attack the four suspects are scheduled to be arraigned on jan 14 at officer livoti s administrative hearing , meanwhile , the clock is ticking officer livoti is eligible to retire , with a pension equaling 40 percent of his salary , on jan 27 , his 15th anniversary on the force he filed his retirement papers last month , police officials said , so they want to get through the trial quickly in order to dismiss him , if he is found guilty , without having to pay his pension i 'd like to retire and get on with my life , officer livoti , who has been on modified duty since his arrest , said last night as he left police headquarters as the hearing began , two of mr baez s brothers and his father testified about how a touch football game outside the family home in the university heights section of the bronx led to a confrontation with police officers , arrests , and then the death of mr baez we 're reliving everything again , said his mother , iris , who sat in the front row of the hearing room clutching a red bible , just as she did every day at the criminal trial he should have been off the force a long time ago the hearing is being held before the police department s deputy commissioner of trials , rae koshetz , who sat on a bench between an american flag and a green , white and blue police department flag hanging from her bench was a framed copy of the new york city police department values , including a pladge to value human life , respect the dignity of each individual and render our services with courtesy and civility the police department s decision to open its internal administrative hearing to the public reflected how anxious it is to repair an image tarnished by the livoti case pickets and street demonstrations against the police have been held regularly in the bronx since officer livoti s acquittal and even as acting justice gerald sheindlin found him not guilty of murder , the judge said that the officer was insulting and blamed his rude , confrontational attitude for escalating a dispute over a football game into a tragedy it is just the opposite of the image the force wants to cultivate , with an advertising campaign lauding its community policing efforts within the department there was the sentiment that officer livoti was a bad officer with a record of 11 complaints of abuse and brutality though none of the charges were substantiated , they were deemed serious enough to put him in a program for special surveillance and psychological counseling
in the cloud of statistics that surface when the city and its largest police union sit down at the bargaining table , whose numbers are to be believed \? the giuliani administration said yesterday that it would present arbitrators with papers showing that even before a proposed raise of almost 16 percent over five years , the city s 37 , 700 police officers are already compensated better than those in 20 other major cities the patrolmen s benevolent association contended that those numbers were not only out of date the city concedes they show compensation levels from late 1993 but that they measured the city against only the yardsticks that fit the administration s purposes the union faxed reporters a single chart showing current salaries in suffolk county , whose officers are among the highest paid in the country we think that their numbers are all going to prove to be inaccurate when they 're held to close scrutiny , said lou matarazzo , president of the pba he said , however , that union officials did not yet have all the contracts from other departments in front of us , so we ca n't say where we stand right now city hall says that new york city s police department cannot fairly be compared with those in the suburbs because everything from the nature of the job to the costs of municipal government is vastly different at the heart of understanding the gulf between the two versions is grasping the definitions that underlie the numbers new york city , chronically strapped for cash , has a long history of giving its union generous benefits stretched out over several years rather than large salary increases that require cash up front city officials like to refer to total compensation , which includes not only salaries but also the city s contribution to the union s pension fund \( 557 million in fiscal 1997 \) and the number of sick days , vacation and personal days available our police officers get 27 vacation days a year , one personal day and unlimited sick time , said randy m mastro , the deputy mayor for operations taking all of that into account changes things , he said the average officer gets seven weeks or more a year off , which is better than nearly every other department in the country i do n't get seven weeks off do you \? examining salaries without considering days actually worked is meaningless , he said the charts the city presented yesterday , for example , show that a new york officer s total annual compensation after 10 years of service is 73 , 951 the figure includes base salary , bonuses for staying with the department a decade , additional pay for night work , and the city s payment per officer to the pension fund the only other cities in the 70 , 000 range , according to the document , were san jose , calif , with 72 , 677 , and san francisco , with 72 , 335 nine of the 20 largest cities were as far as 30 , 000 behind , with philadelphia , for example , at 47 , 782 none of the figures consider the cost of living in various cities the new york region , mr matarazzo noted , is expensive new york city officials contend that its most powerful argument involves what new york officers earn in a category their negotiators call perhour compensation that factors in sick time , holidays and vacation to calculate how much time officers put in for their salaries the city contends that its officers earn 3922 per hour , higher than in any of the 20 other cities san francisco officers earn 3839 per hour , for example , while those in memphis , at the bottom of the list , earn 2040 mr matarazzo said yesterday that his union had never accepted the way city hall calculated relative compensation for police officers relying on statistics he received just yesterday , he said that officers in los angeles with 10 years of experience earned a base pay of 57 , 044 , while in new york , officers with 10 years' experience earned 41 , 493 part of the difficulty for the union s leadership is the example of nassau and suffolk counties , where thousands of new york city police officers live officers with 10 years of experience can earn a maximum salary of more than 59 , 000 in nassau and more than 65 , 000 in suffolk the giuliani administration does not dispute those figures , but contends , as city officials have for decades , that it is misleading not to factor in work rules and benefits mr mastro noted that not only do city negotiators reject comparing new york city to its suburbs , but arbitrators have also consistently looked only at comparable urban areas when weighing contract offers it s a very different style of policing and municipal governing in cities , he said , mentioning among other factors that nassau and suffolk counties used singleofficer instead of twoperson patrol cars and contributed far less per year to officers' pension funds new york city must also pay for separate fulltime fire and sanitation departments and a public hospital system , he said , which the counties do not it s apples and oranges , and no arbitrator is going to look at it that way , said mr mastro mr matarazzo did not disagree , saying the process would be stacked against the union because we have to go the office of collective bargaining , which is an arm of the city of new york

the surreal trial of pol pot , held last week in a shed deep in the jungle of northern cambodia , was the antithesis of justice it was a show trial designed to demonstrate that the khmer rouge has broken with its old leader and is deserving of new legitimacy instead it showed how little the khmer rouge has changed the rest of the world , however , has progressed in dispensing justice to men like pol pot there are ways to give him the trial that he , and his millionplus cambodian victims , deserve the khmer rouge invited a journalist , nate thayer , to tape the proceedings , which were broadcast in america by abc news pol pot and three loyal generals were charged by the khmer rouge s new leaders with recent offenses , including the execution of the group s defense minister one after another , speakers harangued them as about 500 people , some in uniform , many missing limbs or eyes , sat and watched , segregated by sex many appeared to be in their 20 s the spectators periodically lifted their fists in unison and shouted crush , crush , crush pol pot and his clique pol pot , feeble and unable to walk unsupported , sat silently the eeriest thing about the trial was not its complete lack of due process no one could have expected anything else but its triviality was this charade the final reckoning for a regime that killed perhaps onequarter of all cambodians \? such a court inspired little confidence that the verdict of life under house arrest would be carried out pol pot was tried for internal political reasons , not because he directed genocide or mass murder indeed , his accusers barely mentioned his 197579 reign of terror cambodians who watched excerpts of the trial on a television set in phnom penh said , not surprisingly , that they were unsatisfied the nation s leaders have acknowledged that their justice system cannot provide a fair , unpoliticized trial of pol pot and have asked for international help the khmer rouge refuses to turn him over to an international tribunal , but this is probably not the last word cambodia s strongman , hun sen , may try to placate international critics of his own autocratic coup by capturing pol pot under international law , pol pot s crimes can be tried in any nation with the appropriate laws , but none have volunteered the best course is for the united nations to establish an international tribunal like those for rwanda and bosnia this would require overcoming the objections of china it is a pity that a permanent international criminal court does not yet exist the united nations may be on its way to creating one , though it would come too late to handle pol pot if the remaining differences are resolved , at this time next year nations will begin to ratify an international criminal court treaty the court was first discussed after the nuremberg tribunals , but is only now a real possibility after 50 years of coldwar squabbling it is hard to think of any more eloquent argument for the court than the khmer rouge s grotesque trial of pol pot

developed the names for the characters phonetically , mr lucas said i obviously wanted to telegraph a bit of the character in the name the names needed to sound unusual but not spacey i wanted to stay away from the kind of science fiction names like zenon and zorba they had to sound indigenous and have consistency between their names and their culture much has been made of the director s use of world myths from joseph campbell s hero with a thousand faces , but star wars is also a synthesis of the treasure trove of american pop culture everything from comic strips , pulp fiction and films ranging from john ford s searchers to victor fleming s wizard of oz to akira kurosawa s hidden fortress star wars in turn has spawned a galaxy of subindustries more than two dozen novels , trading

albany , may 4 in the five years leading up to the current battle over rent controls , new york city landlords and developers mounted a quiet concerted effort to build their influence in state government through a large increase in campaign contributions , with one of the stated aims being to do away with the rent laws the campaign has made real estate interests , always important figures in state politics , among the biggest contributors to the state republican party and republican candidates for state office including the lawmakers leading the bid to abolish most rent regulation this has been a longterm effort , said joseph strasburg , president of the rent stabilization association , the major landlords' group if elected officials know you 're going to be there for them , there s more comfort there for them to do the right thing the effort is illustrated by the pattern of political contributions from property owners and their political action committees , or pac s the rent stabilization association s pac did not make a single contribution to a state race until 1992 in the next five years , it gave almost 750 , 000 to state candidates and party committees , making it one of the biggest players in state politics the two major landlord pac s , the association s and the neighborhood preservation political action fund , gave just 1 , 250 to state republican party committees in 1991 and 1992 in the next four years , they gave almost 200 , 000 to those committees , and nothing to their democratic counterparts republican officials generally support abolishing or reducing rent protections , while democrats usually want to preserve them the contribution of the same two pac s to legislative races rose to 362 , 000 in 1995 and 1996 from 212 , 000 in 1991 and 1992 , and favored republicans over democrats by a 10to1 ratio political giving by the city s big real estate interests , which has also grown rapidly in recent years , far outstrips that of the pac s just a small group of them the mack family , donald j trump , the fisher brothers , bernard h mendik , leonard litwin , lewis rudin , the milstein family , sheldon h solow and peter s kalikow has given more than 11 million to state campaigns and party committees since the start of 1993 , overwhelmingly to republicans the money trail shows how , in 1992 and 1993 , real estate interests increased their contributions to the republicans who control the state senate it shows the swing , in 1994 , against a democratic governor and toward a republican challenger who indicated that he would be more supportive of their goals it also shows how , starting in 1994 , landlords shifted their giving to republican party committees controlled primarily by the new governor , george e pataki , and his patron , senator alfonse m d'amato and it shows that , in 1996 , they boldly took on the democrats who control the assembly , increasing their support for republicans , including those challenging democratic incumbents it s all about a number of issues affecting the industry , including rent control , said lester shulklapper , a lobbyist for the real estate board of new york with the repeal last year of the state s capital gains tax on the sale of real estate worth more than 1 million , he said , there s no doubt that at this stage , rent control is the main thing there is no sign that the contributions have changed many minds joseph l bruno , the senate majority leader , wanted to kill the rent laws years before the landlords' campaign began mr pataki , too , has long favored some modification of the regulations , leading to a gradual elimination if landlords contribute to me because they support me philosophically , well , that s their prerogative , mr bruno said it wo n't change my mind one way or the other mr bruno has long asserted that the rent laws discourage the building of new houses , worsening housing shortages and , paradoxically , driving up rental prices but tenant advocates say that mr bruno would not be fighting so hard to do away with the rent laws without such strong financial backing from property owners and they suggest that without so much support from the real estate industry , mr pataki might not have been elected the neighborhood preservation fund was the fourthlargest contributor to last year s races for the legislature , according to a study by the new york public interest research group , and the real estate board pac was the sixthlargest the rent stabilization association pac narrowly missed making the list of the top 16 that research group compiled the landlords' effort has been bankrolled and directed , to a great degree , by some of the biggest names in real estate , who are major political contributors on their own and officials of the landlord pac s they want to give the impression that this is about small landlords , that this is about wealthy tenants and poor landlords , when it s about superwealthy landlords trying to get a lot richer , said billy easton , the albany representative of the new york state tenants and neighbors coalition , the state s biggest tenants' group , which is lobbying to keep the rent laws in place
augusta , ga , april 8 greg norman was sitting at a dais here today , his face serene , his shoulders squared a year after a masters defeat so ghastly it has been called the worst collapse in major championship golf history , norman was wearing an almost beatific expression collapse \? what collapse \? memories \? what memories \? i 'll just think about the good things i 've done here , norman said i 'll think about the 63 s i 've shot here and the 64 s i 've shot here if you keep thinking about the worst round you 've ever had in your life , you 're going to keep on playing that same round freshly inspired after a oneoneone session with the motivational guru tony robbins , norman claims to have expunged the memories of the finalround 78 that turned a sixstroke lead into a fivestroke defeat at the very cold hands of nick faldo , who shot 67 if norman were to somehow manage to actually do that , and come back and play well here this week possibly even contend it would underscore once again just how resilient he is and perhaps alter the way he is remembered let s face it , norman said earlier this season , i'm not the only one who s ever blown a lead i screwed up badly , but it s happened before and it will happen again , to me or to someone else that s the nature of the game it has happened before , and many times major championship golf is rife with example after example of players failing to close the deal each in their own way have been poignant was norman s finalround 78 any more gruesome than the 81 suffered by thirdround leader gil morgan in the 1992 united states open at pebble beach \? was it more painful to watch than , say , arnold palmer , blowing a sevenstroke lead with nine holes to play in the 1966 united states open at olympic club \? how about the time ben hogan shared the 54hole lead in the 1952 masters with sam snead and shot 79 to tie for seventh \? for excruciating collapses , was n't hale irwin s 79 in the final round of the 1984 united states open at winged foot the same open coincidentally , in which norman fought his way into a tie with fuzzy zoeller only to be dusted by seven strokes in the playoff \( 68 to 75 \) at least comparable \? irwin , who was burdened by the serious illness of his father at the time , completely lost his game that sunday his iron play was abysmal he hit just over half the greens in regulation here he was , a twotime united states open champion with 16 victories on the pga tour , and he collapsed this is something that will either make me stronger or weaker , irwin said , right after slamming his locker shut at winged foot decide for yourself irwin , who was 39 at the time , won four more tournaments , including the 1990 united states open at medinah because the stakes are so much higher , the audiences so much larger and the pressure so much greater , collapses in major championships happen more often jack nicklaus is the exception to this rule , just as he is to most others of the 10 times nicklaus either led or shared the lead after 54 holes in a major , he won nine norman s record is 1 of 7 none of which seems to faze him norman has appeared on three television specials leading up to the masters , and with each successive appearance first on 60 minutes , then on espn with jimmy roberts and then on the golf channel he has seemed more quietly determined to walk into the velvet vise that is augusta and prevail going back to augusta , he said on the golf channel , will be the challenge of my life and it will be this place , more than any other course where major championships are played , can suffocate the leaders the holes down in the hollow where amen corner sits are close together , and the roars and moans reverberate off the sides of hills and bounce off the pine trees the effect can be extremely unnerving it s hard to ignore it , norman said the ghosts of many masters leaders past , particularly those who could n't ignore it , stand in testimony to that the shakiest masters finish of all might still be ed sneed s up by two at the turn in 1979 , sneed finished bogeybogeybogey and lost in a threeway playoff to zoeller then there was curtis strange , who led bernhard langer by four strokes at the turn in 1985 strange hit balls in the water at the 13th and 15th holes , shot 39 and lost by two strokes in a telling display of his obstinacy , strange told the former united states golf association executive director , frank hannigan , shortly afterward that he would play the holes exactly the same way again and you 'd lose the damn tournament again , hannigan replied norman has no plans to play the same way after all , he went down in a horrifying slowmotion death that was evocative of an old sam peckinpah film whether he will lose the tournament again , who knows \? all he wants is the opportunity , whether it s against faldo or tiger woods or anyone else in the field photo greg norman appearing cool and collected at practice at augusta \( reuters \)
the couple in the corner were staring glumly at their plates as the carnival atmosphere swirled around them in the huge room , they were the only people not having fun it s so much food , the woman said with distaste she shoved her plate away just as a waiter arrived with another skewer of meat looking at the ribs threaded along it with something akin to loathing , she said insistently i ca n't eat any more really the waiter moved sadly away , his shoulders slumped , as if he had been personally rejected two things are required to truly appreciate churrascaria plataforma a large appetite to keep you eating and a large group to cheer you on a caipirinha or two does n't hurt either the potent brazilian drink , a mixture of fresh limes , sugar and cachaca , liquor made from raw sugar cane , is the perfect fuel for this festive experience churrascaria plataforma is new york city s newest rodizio , the allyoucaneat brazilian restaurant it is distinguished from the others by the high quality of the food and the charming attitude of the waiters the salad bar is extraordinary , a long twosided affair anchored at the corners by four hot casseroles and tended with fierce pride by a woman who looks as if she has stepped straight from a painting by picasso she hovers nearby , pouncing on each ingredient and prepared salad the moment it is less than pristine and making certain that none are ever empty when i asked her a question , she lighted up with happiness , gladly explaining that the vegetable i liked so much , the one with a taste halfway between cucumber and honeydew melon , was a brazilian squash we call it xuxu , \( pronounced shooshoo \) she said , urging me to have some more chayote , i thought , of course she watched happily as i loaded my plate with avocado , fresh lima beans , watercress , hearts of palm , marinated mushrooms and more the salads , different on each visit , were always intriguing the woman at the salad bar will be very upset if you scorn the four hot dishes she has a point these , too , have varied on different visits , but i would have been sorry to have missed the fine paella , the extraordinarily tender octopus stew , the black rice with squid or the tutu de feijao , a typically brazilian mixture of red beans , bacon and farofa , the ground yuca flour , topped with garlicky shredded kale go easy this is only the appetizer , and it takes stamina to do justice to the main part of the meal when you are ready to move on to the next course , turn the marker by your plate to its green side to start the parade first a waiter appears with plates of fried potatoes , fried yuca , wonderful little squares of fried polenta , a bit of rice , some farofa and a dish of vinaigrette these dishes may seem small to feed an entire table , and they are meat is the main point , as you will soon see there is no point in being prudent at a churrascaria it is a rabelaisian experience , and if you are not prepared to throw caution to the winds , eating more than you have ever eaten before , it is not the place for you the waiters will entice you with ham , sausage , lamb , wonderfully crisp and juicy chicken legs , pork ribs , even the occasional side of salmon , which is delicious in its caper sauce but it is beef that has pride of place on my last visit , we were offered 15 cuts of meat , 8 of them beef sirloin , baby beef , top round , skirt steak , brisket , short ribs , special top round most were rare all were wonderfully seasoned and served in generous portions roast beef was the last to appear , arriving triumphantly on its own cart surrounded by skewers of onions and peppers by then i just could n't face another bite but you must , said the brazilian man at the next table , whose unending appetite had been a source of wonder at ours it is the best when i demurred , he urged me to ask for some hot sauce to go with it it will give you more appetite , he insisted and so , of course , i did the hot sauce was clear , very potent with an intense and almost smoky flavor it did , indeed , give me the courage to go on when we finally cried uncle and turned our markers red side up , a woman appeared with a dessert cart she was so pretty and so enthusiastic that it was hard to turn her down passion fruit moussey , she urged it is very digestive she described queijo , a bright yellow dessert rich with egg yolks and coconut , and manjar , a white coconut pudding served with prunes the words sounded like poetry when she said them , all soft syllables , and the desserts themselves had an appealing rustic quality if they were , in fact , more interesting than wonderful , that was all to the good the only reason to eat dessert after so much meat is to prove that you can churrascaria

will the fed just wait \? that s the nagging question for investors ahead of tuesday s meeting of the federal reserve s policymaking committee indeed , for many on wall street , the only thing worse than the fed s raising rates next week is the fed s deciding not to raise rates why \? since many investors believe that at least one more rate increase this year is inevitable , it makes sense to them to get it out of the way now in contrast with march , when analysts were overwhelmingly convinced that the central bank would raise shortterm interest rates rather than hold them steady , sentiment on wall street today is split about what the fed will do inflation is practically nonexistent and the robust growth of the first quarter appears to be fading reasons for the fed to hold off but if the fed leaves its target rate at 55 percent on tuesday , uncertainty may dog the financial markets and stocks and bonds are more likely to experience sharp ups and downs this summer , extending the rollercoaster ride of recent months it makes for a more uncertain market and , therefore , the possibility of a more volatile market , said richard berner , the chief economist at the mellon bank in pittsburgh unless the economy slows much more than expected , every new economic report will be scoured for hints of what the fed s policy makers will do when they gather again in july and given the erratic nature of a lot of the government s statistics , markets could be in for some wild swings what would be especially tough is a string of economic reports indicating that the slowdown in consumer spending in april was simply a pause rather than a genuine downshift in the exuberant pace of earlier this year traders would conclude that the economy was too strong for the fed to feel confident that inflation would remain under control , reversing the sentiment underlying the recent rally interest rates would move higher and stock prices lower with a rate increase next week , the outlook would be different , even if stocks and bonds tumble initially on one hand , if the slowdown is confirmed in economic reports for may and june , then a fed rate increase next week would clear the way for a market rally with two fed rate increases already in the bag , investors could fairly conclude that the central bank would wait quite a while before acting again on the other hand , even if the economic news turns out to be less comforting to wall street , the fed s backtoback rate increases would help squelch speculation that the central bank would try a third rate increase so soon and the confidence that the fed was ahead of the curve would help cushion any fall the fed , of course , has to take a lot more into account than just the markets and perhaps the biggest force weighing against an immediate rate increase is the one fed officials never like to talk about politics the criticism of the fed from politicians and commentators has been sharp enough since its quarterpoint increase in march that alan greenspan , the fed s chairman , went out of his way last week to deliver an unusually detailed defense of the central bank the sniping would certainly increase if the fed lifts rates again next week , especially because it is so hard to persuade elected officials of the need for acting before a new inflationary surge is detected launching a preemptive strike against inflation has to be difficult in any political context , mr berner of the mellon bank said the fed wants to be preemptive but not premature if the fed is premature , he said , it erodes its public support and its political support for what they do and their independence moreover , the underlying economic rationale for a rate increase , in the eyes of some wall street economists , has weakened in the last two weeks william dudley , the chief united states economist at goldman , sachs company , just changed his view on thursday , saying that the odds favor the fed standing pat citing the fed s decision last summer not to raise interest rates despite a burst of growth in the spring , mr dudley said that mr greenspan has shown a willingness to be patient when the economy is slowing indeed , even analysts who lean toward a rate increase acknowledge that the fed has plenty of reasons to be patient the producer price index has fallen four months in a row , including a sixtenths of a percent decline in april the consumer price index is up just 25 percent in the last 12 months , while the more closely watched employment cost index rose less than 3 percent the decline in april retail sales is also a sign that the opportunity to raise prices remains limited and the balanced budget agreement in washington helps ease fears the fed has already moved once this year to brake the economy by raising its federal funds target the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans but others contend that the weight of evidence tilts slightly in the other direction they start with the exceptionally low unemployment rate since last may , it has dropped to 49 percent from 55 percent while most experts applaud an economy capable of generating jobs for almost everyone who wants one , the fear is that the jobless rate is so low that it is just a matter of time before inflationary pressures bubble over the average unemployment rate for the last 12 months of 53 percent is the lowest since the year ended february 1990 , when inflation was clearly on the rise and the economy was only a few months from falling into recession other than that brief period , unemployment has not been so low in nearly a quarter of a century as for real growth , which has averaged about 4 percent in the last year , the economy has not expanded at such a rapid pace for a full year since 1987 before that , the last three quarters of 1984 and the first of 1985 added up to another strong year but at that time the economy was still rebounding from the severe 198182 recession and labor markets were not tight unemployment averaged 74 percent and was still at 62 percent in 1987 so for all the talk of a new economic era , it is no surprise that mr greenspan is worried that conditions today are simply too good to last in defending the fed s march 25 rate increase in his speech last week , the fed chairman said the move was taken not so much as a consequence of a change in the most probable forecast of moderate growth and low inflation for later this year and next , but rather to address the probability that being wrong had materially increased to robert barbera , the chief economist of hoenig company , that means the fed s job is to make sure that growth is n't so brisk over the next 12 months that it lowers the unemployment rate but even with that in mind , he says , next week the fed could still leave wall street waiting graph tightening the screws by one measure , monetary policy is almost as restrictive as it has been this decade graph shows

george sard was scanning the news reports on the computer in his office overlooking third avenue a month ago when a bulletin jerked him up short hilton hotels had begun a hostile 65 billion takeover bid for itt he immediately wanted in on the battle a week earlier , mr sard , one of a small cadre of specialists in financial public relations and merger work , had helped initiate banc one s friendly 7 billion acquisition of first usa in nine days , he would handle the announcement of a deal that would shake wall street , dean witter s 102 billion purchase of morgan stanley and now , before mr sard could think of whom he might call at either hilton or itt , the phone rang it was itt , asking mr sard to join a team to try to fend off hilton like many of his rivals in public relations , mr sard and his partner , paul verbinnen , are riding the trilliondollar wave of mergers and acquisitions that has inundated wall street and american industry in the last two years , though they are more often heard but not seen i'm really quite amazed at how often they show up , said fred seegal , president of the wasserstein perella group the increased level of manda work has given firms like sard a good opportunity to show their capabilities depending on the transaction , financial publicists do everything from writing press releases and coordinating conference calls for analysts to advising on strategy and the proper spin for layoffs and corporate raids they also ply reporters with information that they hope will strengthen their client s case and undermine the company on the other side mr sard s firm , sard verbinnen company , does not lead the field kekst company remains the high priest of financial public relations and crisis consulting , with the fastgrowing abernathy macgregor group taking a firm grip on no 2 but in the four years since mr sard and mr verbinnen joined forces , their firm has jumped into the no 3 spot , ahead of betterknown firms like bursonmarsteller , fleishmanhillard and robinson lerer montgomery sard verbinnen has been involved in four of the biggest deals in 1997 , with a combined value of 30 billion when crain s new york magazine last ranked the top public relations firms as measured by the number of employees , none of these boutiques showed up but their business can be more lucrative people in the industry estimate that sard verbinnen , with its 23 employees , may have billed as much as 6 million last year , more than some firms with more employees plus , retainers for a firm like sard verbinnen can run from 10 , 000 to 50 , 000 a month , while billing rates for a crisis situation or a oneshot event can rival those of the whiteshoe lawyers who charge 400 an hour plus expenses sard verbinnen , which handles a lot of work in financial services but does not show up in the big utility or railroad mergers , has its share of bluechip clients like ibm , aetna and bank of boston but mr sard has also attracted some share of controversy inside and outside his firm by representing joseph jett , the bond trader accused of creating 339 million in phony trades at kidder , peabody company , and the corporate raider bennett s lebow michael ovitz , the onceinvincible hollywood power broker , turned to mr sard in december 1996 when he was squeezed out as president of the walt disney company amid a flurry of negative publicity the two had met and become friendly in 1990 while both were advising matsushita on its acquisition of mca now , mr ovitz wanted to keep from being pilloried in the press as he left disney by mutual agreement with the chairman , michael eisner initial reports emanating from disney indicated that mr ovitz would get a severance package worth about 20 million it was mr sard who pointed out that mr ovitz s package could be worth 90 million in hollywood , high pay equals high status though it s questionable that such information helped mr ovitz s image anywhere else in america , and mr eisner was forced to endure criticism from stock analysts and shareholders for such a grandiose payoff at the time , mr sard was accused of inflating mr ovitz s golden parachute , but on tuesday he was vindicated when mr eisner finally acknowledged to shareholders that mr ovitz s hiring had been a tragic 90 million mistake mr sard said he had been merely helping out a friend , without pay a former college baseball pitcher , who at age 43 retains his love of the yankees if not his fastball , mr sard is credited by clients with an ability to understand the sore points of various constituencies in a deal in the words of one critic , he has an ability to make his clients believe that they are the most important thing in the world to him , particularly when they 're

soup nazi , beware franchise concepts , a franchising company run by the man who helped make boston chicken a household name , has agreed to acquire soup nutsy , the manhattan soup company george a naddaff , the chairman and acting chief executive officer of franchise concepts , which also owns the ranch 1 chicken restaurant chain , would not say how much his company was paying for soup nutsy mr naddaff , who is a former chairman of boston chicken , said franchise concepts would initially spend about 1 million to expand soup nutsy around the new york area the goal , said pak melwani , a founder of soup nutsy who will stay with the company in a senior management post , is to make soup nutsy a namebrand chain in the soup business by adding up to five more locations in new york city by fall and 40 to 50 more in the new york metropolitan area within two years none of this may have happened without the soup nazi , whose real name is al yeganeh mr yeganeh , as anyone who loves consomme or comedy knows by now , was caricatured on a classic seinfeld episode parodying the militarylike precision with which he delivered his soup to his customers at his soup kitchen international store on west 55th street after that episode , mr melwani and his partners began planning soup nutsy , deliberately playing up the name , and even coming up with a logo of a scowling chef it opened in june 1996 at a store on 48th street near lexington avenue , featuring a rotating menu of soups , including jerusalem chicken matzoh ball , mongolian tomato and pea and vichyssoise parisienne david w chen

hamburg , germany , aug 19 leni riefenstahl will be 95 years old on friday , and if she imagined the years would diminish the stigma she accumulated 60 years ago and more as hitler s favored moviemaker , then she was apparently wrong when an exhibit of her work the first in postwar germany opened here last week , the focus was on those denouncing her roots in the third reich and on a debate about a particularly troubled corollary can art that grew in such soil ever transcend its origins \? the discussion is , in fact , more interesting than the exhibit , said andreas schluter , who arranged the exhibit of 50 colored postwar photographs and blackandwhite prewar film clips at his secondfloor gallery close to hamburg s main railroad station ms riefenstahl has staked out her own position in the debate can art be separated from politics \? she said in a telephone interview from her home on the starnbergersee in bavaria if an artist is possessed by his art , then he does not have the possibility to do anything else an admiring adolf hitler sought out the filmmaker to direct what has been termed the most notorious documentary ever filmed triumph of the will a depiction of the nazi party rally that became a central motif of hitler s dictatorship in scenes that have chilled subsequent generations , the documentary shows the massed banners and uplifted faces of hitler s devoted followers marching by his podium yet , ms riefenstahl insisted today , it was only a documentary it could be used for propaganda purposes , but i did n't make it as propaganda indeed , she recalled , the film won a major award as a documentary in paris in 1937 triumph of the will was followed by her renowned documentary coverage of the 1936 berlin olympics , olympia , cementing her reputation as a documentarymaker entwined with the nazi ideology of aryan supremacy so close was the association that time magazine , she recalled , once referred to her erroneously as hitler s girlfriend at the core of the argument over the exhibition , of course , is postwar germany s unresolved fixation with its history that seems to trip modern germans at every turn only last week , two conscripts were discharged from the german army after an arson attack on a home for foreigners , a development that raised worrisome questions about screening military recruits for rightwing sympathies and even this week , government officials are negotiating with jewish officials over compensation payments to holocaust survivors in eastern europe almost routinely , the past rears up in highschool courses and histories with the warning that it should not be repeated but , at mr schluter s gallery here , the discussion is tinged with a further question is there a statute of limitations , so to speak , for those , like ms riefenstahl , who spent three years after world war ii in american and french internment camps and who underwent the process known as denazification , through which germans were supposed to equip themselves to begin anew \? this is really a significant question , mr schluter said in an interview during which he acknowledged deep admiration for ms reifenstahl s work , first as a filmmaker in the 1930 s and then as a photographer in the postwar era \( even today , despite her years , she is working on a deepsea video reflecting her fascination with submarine themes she learned to dive more than 20 years ago when she was in her 70 s three days after her birthday , she plans a diving trip to hawaii to work on her next film \) for 50 years , leni riefenstahl has been working with photography , said mr schluter , who is 36 there is a postwar person here and perhaps one can make a distinction between that person and the prewar moviemaker even then , ms riefenstahl challenges the stereotype of herself as what mr schluter described as a synonym for the third reich about the holocaust , she says i did not know what was going on i did not know anything about these things accordingly , she said , referring to the nazi ideology , i distance myself from all that ms riefenstahl s rise to preeminence among german moviemakers began in 1932 when she directed the blue light , the story of an innocent mountain girl , which reflected the interest in mountain themes she had discovered starring in arnold fanck s dramatic movies it was that film that caught hitler s eye and led him to ask her to make triumph of the will ms riefenstahl says she had begun to have doubts about hitler whom at first she greatly admired in 1937 because his views on art conflicted with hers the war , in effect , ended her moviemaking detained from 1945 to 1948 , she said today , she repeatedly insisted to her captors that she had not been a nazi party member and had never uttered an antisemitic phrase and was never a racist nonethless , her past caught up with her no one would hire her to make movies and even when she turned to color photography and traveled to the sudan to take a series of photographs of nubians , which appeared in book form in the 1970 s , she was again accused of pursuing the fascist aesthetic of glorification of the male body absolute nonsense , she said today her work has been exhibited in japan and italy where it also drew protests in milan but the hamburg exhibit is the first in germany though she had had other offers , she said , she accepted mr schulter s because she found him agreeable for his part , the gallery owner said he had conceived the exhibition as a great admirer of ms riefenstahl s work pointedly , there are no stills from triumph of the will in the exhibit critically , the exhibit has inspired a huge surge of interest in ms riefenstahl and her work she has been interviewed for most of germany s major weekly publications der spiegel , stern and die zeit , for instance but the attention has not always been flattering interviewers have again pursued her association and fascination with hitler , critics have challenged the merit of her photography , which also includes underwater photographs of coral reefs other , older germans , mr schluter said , have left the exhibit in a nostalgic and sympathetic mood none of this amounts to a formal rehabilitation no public officials attended the exhibit s opening i absolutely cannot imagine that i did something unjust , ms riefenstahl said in one published interview what crime did i commit \?

jerusalem , march 14 the israeli cabinet resolved today to go ahead next week with the building of a new jewish neighborhood in east jerusalem despite warnings from security officials of a large potential for violent palestinian resistance the cabinet reaffirmed its decision as the nation mourned the seven schoolgirls killed on thursday by a jordanian soldier on the jordan river the girls were buried overnight at the cemetery in their town of beit shemesh in wrenching ceremonies attended by prime minister benjamin netanyahu , defense minister yitzhak mordechai and other officials the combination of tight security , bright television lights and the presence of hundreds of townspeople seemed to intensify the grief and anger , and some relatives yelled bitter insults at the politicians in the morning , classes at the orthodox high school the girls attended were canceled , and psychiatrists circulated among the students , urging them to pour out their feelings and to write messages about the victims on a blackboard the killings dominated all newspapers , which were filled with pictures of the 13 and 14yearold eighth graders , who were killed on a school visit to a patch of land in the northern jordan valley known as the island of peace the land is under jordanian sovereignty but leased as farmland by israelis the attacker , a 26yearold jordanian army sergeant , remained in custody , and no new information emerged about his motives officials said his full name was ahmad musa mustafa aldaqamsa in amman , jordan , king hussein appointed a former chief of the country s intelligence service to investigate the shooting the investigator , mohammed abdul rasul alkailani , is a trusted confidant of king hussein his last post , from 1993 to february 1996 , was as security adviser to the king according to witnesses , sergeant daqamsa did not carry a weapon , but grabbed one from a comrade and charged the girls , emptying a magazine before he was overpowered by other soldiers mr netanyahu s eulogy at the funerals served as a grim prologue to the cabinet meeting if anyone thinks the murder of little girls will bring this people to its knees , or that we will relinquish our birthright , our sacred land and eternal capital , he does not know the strength that exists in each person standing here around me today and in the entire nation , he declared according to israeli television reports , mr netanyahu summoned chiefs of all security services to give the ministers detailed appraisals of what the construction on the site , known as har homa , entailed , so that none could later say they were not warned the reports said the warnings outlined possibilities from rockthrowing to fullfledged rioting and terror attacks after several hours of discussion , the cabinet voted unanimously to reaffirm its decision of two weeks ago , clearing the way for bulldozers to begin work as early as monday the ministers were said to have divided into two camps , a majority in favor of plunging ahead , and a minority who argued for further review the latter included defense minister mordechai , finance minister dan meridor , foreign minister david levy and tourism minister moshe katzav the decision is certain to come under fierce attack by yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , who has summoned representatives of the united states , russia , europe , the arab world and japan to gaza on saturday to discuss the israeli plans the conference is strongly opposed by israel , which was not invited , but the united states state department decided to send edward g abington , the consul general in jerusalem in an interview with the mass circulation israeli daily yediot ahronot , given before the shootings but published today , mr arafat said palestinianisraeli relations were in their worst state since the initial oslo accords were signed in 1993 this is not just 'another crisis , ' he said of the planned construction this is the most serious crisis since the oslo process began , and it has farreaching implications one could say the process has come to a halt the government of israel has halted the process it is leading us by the nose , literally its decisions , which it wants to impose on us , are truly a conspiracy against peace and israel is the one who is to bear all the responsibility for all the results the decision to proceed with the new neighborhood in east jerusalem is also likely to reverse whatever good will might have been restored between the israeli government and the palestinians and jordanians immediately after the killings king hussein , who assailed mr netanyahu in a letter last weekend , has expressed condolences to the families of the girls and offered to visit them mr arafat , who cut off all communications with mr netanyahu after the original har homa decision , telephoned the prime minister and proposed a meeting but both king hussein s visit and mr arafat s offer are likely to be forgotten once the bulldozing begins the cabinet decision also came in defiance of a 130to2 vote by the united nations general assembly on thursday calling on israel to abandon the construction plans the united states and israel cast the no votes

working cattle at the decatur county feedyard in oberlin , kan , has always been a complex craft but there was a simplicity to some jobs , like inoculations we used to hold them in the shoot , give them their vaccination and then kick them out , explained the head cowboy , james l fortin today things are different using a large variety of electronic equipment , mr fortin now takes detailed records identifying each animal and collecting data about its size and health , to determine the amount of food and medicine it needs they call me the ultrasound man , now , mr fortin said technology is transforming the cattle and dairy industries competitive pressures , high feed costs and the demand for prime , specialty beef have forced more farmers and ranchers to drive their herds into the electronic frontier cowboy gear may now include electronic scanners along with the more predictable ropes , chaps and pocket knives the scanners collect identifying data from the electronic ear tags that , when downloaded into laptop computers , automatically calls up each cow s family and medical history a slightly different sort of scanner is also mounted on the doors of dairy barns to read which cows come in to be milked the technology allows tracking , from calf to carcass , which is the first step toward herd improvement , said david c warren , president of allflex usa inc , a privately held dallas manufacturer of electronic animal identification devices none of the experts in cattlemen s professional organizations , federal or state agencies or universities can say for sure how many of the nation s 878 million beef cattle and 93 million dairy cows are raised with electronic aids but technology is clearly making inroads in a business whose reliance on physical skill and intuition have made it a metaphor for the american experience still , whatever the folklore surrounding them , cattle are a business proposition tracking them through their lives to determine how to produce the food americans want is crucial to improving profit margins historical information can explain why one animal in a herd fetched top dollar for its prime cuts while another ended up as ground chuck or why one cow yields butterfatrich milk while another does not the results can mean as much as a 300 difference in the value of an animal on average and the averages reflect significant annual fluctuations in price a single head of cattle , which usually weighs between 1 , 000 and 1 , 300 pounds , now sells for 64 cents a pound , according to cattle fax inc , a private research company based in englewood , colo there are so many things , from genetics to type of feed , that can make a difference , said warren weibert , owner and general manager of the decatur county feedyard , one of the most technologically sophisticated agricultural operations in the country mr weibert s yard fattens 24 , 000 cattle for slaughter every six months for the last three years , he has electronically tagged 15 , 000 to identify what factors contribute to production of the uniform , highquality product that meat processors seek raising cattle to suit the market s taste has become more crucial since americans have become increasingly health conscious , looking askance at everything from whole milk to hamburger but even though overall meat consumption has declined in the last decade , demand for prime grade cuts has risen cattle producers' goal nowadays is to come up with those higher grades that consumers have demonstrated they will pay higher prices for , said chuck lambert , chief economist with the national cattlemen s beef association in washington , dc the cattle industry generated 50 billion in retail sales last year decatur is one of a handful of feedlots in the united states that has installed 150 , 000 to 250 , 000 systems like amarillo , texbased micro chemical inc s accutrac to electronically monitor their cattle in fact , according to rod fee , the livestock editor of successful farming , buying such a system makes sense only if an operation s herd exceeds 15 , 000 head central to the system are electronic ear tags that trip sensors that record how often and how much animals eat an electronic tag cost 10 the handheld scanners , between 3 , 400 and 4 , 000 veterinarians scan the tags to chronicle the immunizations and medicines they administer computerized scales and electronic eyes track cows' weight and height feedlot owners who buy 500pound calves from the cowcalf operations and sell mature animals to the slaughterhouses create digitized ultrasonic images of cattle to determine leanness and marbling of their meat you can imagine how helpful that can be when the price of feed hits the ceiling like it did last year , mr fee said if the ultrasound picks up a lot of excess fat , you know that animal s getting too much feed mr weibert said his profits rose an average 20 for each electronically monitored head last year , compared with the previous year
on nights when the knicks move the ball with precision and hit crucial shots , madison square garden is a special place that has not always been the case this season last night , however , it was the place to be patrick ewing s team could do no wrong as it clinched homecourt advantage in the first round of the playoffs by defeating reggie miller and the indiana pacers , 9789 the knicks , who received a huge gift from toronto last night when the raptors knocked off the hornets in charlotte , can clinch the third spot in the eastern conference tonight by defeating the bulls at the united center that , of course , will not be easy they are 08 there since 1994 , when the arena opened , and chicago will be looking to win its 70th game this season the hawks , who are half a game behind the knicks , have two games remaining tonight at home against philadelphia and tomorrow against the nets at continental arena a knick loss to the bulls and two victories by the hawks would give atlanta the thirdseeded berth one atlanta loss would give the two teams identical records , with the knicks winning the tiebreaker because new york took the season series against atlanta it s still in our hands , said ewing , who scored a teamhigh 26 points and hauled down 14 rebounds we 've got a big game tomorrow and we expect to win regarding clinching homecourt advantage , he said it s all right we wanted the third seed that s our goal lost in the playoff picture was that new york \( 5625 \) got contributions from all its hired guns in the stretch , holding off the pacers after indiana had crept to within 7471 with less than 10 minutes left allan houston and larry johnson connected on consecutive 3pointers in the final four and half minutes , pushing the lead to 9 on each occasion chris childs \( 6 assists and 3 turnovers \) was not overly impressive , but he did make his only field goal when it counted , with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining throw in 18 points and 12 rebounds \( 5 offensive \) from charles oakley and key support off the bench from buck williams and john starks , and you have a very balanced team heading into the postseason , a team that seemed on the brink less than a week ago i think that we should play that way every game out now because we play better that way , childs said the knicks began with a flurry , forging a 3318 lead after one quarter starks capped 12 minutes of crisp ball movement and menacing defense when he knocked down a 3pointer at the buzzer in the period , ewing had 13 points and childs had 5 of new york s 11 assists indiana s record dropped to 3942 how quickly the pacers have fallen two years ago , they took orlando to seven games in the conference finals today , they are about to finish 10th in the conference and sixth in the midwest division coach larry brown is rumored to be going anywhere from boston to los angeles , depending upon your published report of the week but the knicks have their own troubles new york has a monster task at hand tonight at the united center , where it will try to beat the bulls on their home floor for the first time since the 199394 season the knicks' last victory in chicago came in the final regularseason game in chicago stadium , a game in which they blew out the bulls of course , michael jordan was playing baseball that day when the time comes for us to play chicago , we 're not going to be thinking about not ever having won at the united center , coach jeff van gundy said players do n't think like that they have too much confidence in themselves this team has played in the united center a total of one time this is a different team this team has n't lost however many in a row we 've lost once this year there , by 1 point the score in the bulls' 8887 victory in early january was misleading because the knicks had to battle back from a doublefigure deficit in the final two quarters van gundy said we want to win tomorrow , obviously you 're playing a game and going for a higher seed as far as carryover effect , it has absolutely none i'm convinced that it does n't matter whether you 're playing well at the end of the year or badly going into the playoffs rebounds the knicks finished 3110 at the garden this season , the most victories at home since the 199394 season included in that mark was a 15game winning streak between dec 7 and jan 28 jeff van gundy is not lamenting a single possession or game if his team does not secure the no 3 playoff spot we can point to 25 games , to tell you the truth , he said the knicks are 10 when one of their players sings the national anthem the rookie walter mccarty did the honors before the game a crooner of some renown who once sang the national anthem before a kentuckyindiana game in college , mccarty s teammates walked out to midcourt and hugged and highfived him as he finished he also played for only the third time in the past 11 games , scoring 2 points and grabbing a rebound in six firsthalf minutes i thought he played well , van gundy said he sang well , too it was n't one of those dragged out ones photos patrick ewing , going up for a shot against the pacers , finished with 26 points

the first technical term added to a beginner s vocabulary when learning to snowboard is face plant these words describe what happens when the downhill edge of a moving snowboard touches the mountain , sending the rider flying with a violent jerk face first into the snow from the chairlift at stratton mountain in vermont , snowboarders and skiers have a bird seye view of faces being planted all over the slopes for beginners , face plants are a common occurrence for the intermediate snowboarder , face plants are a constant fear , and for anyone who has spent a long day on the mountain , face plants are what happen over dinner in a hot bowl of soup on a recent friday , some friends and i drove to stratton with the purpose of learning how to snowboard although this is not the closest mountain to manhattan \( it s a more than fourhour drive \) , stratton , which calls itself the birthplace of snowboarding , has distinct advantages over closer mountains hunter , just 2 1 2 hours from new york city , tends to get overcrowded , with toddlers on leashes and large groups of teenagers and families knocking one another over mount snow , just south of stratton in vermont , offers more of a singles scene as saturated with trails as it is with expensive ski wear , the mediumsize mountain is a better place to ride once you have passed the faceplant phase of snowboarding and though killington , also in vermont , is the biggest resort in the area , with the selfgiven nickname the beast of the east , most of the trails are not snowboardfriendly stratton is a wellgroomed , picturesque mountain , almost entirely devoid of the ultrasteep , mogulfilled or bonebreaking slopes that attract hotshots even a tyro can ride to the top of the mountain and find a variety of long , gentle , winding trails to take the mountain s specialty is intermediate trails nice declines , long and wide , that evenly fluctuate from steep to not so steep it s perfect for the beginning snowboarder there is also an area of the mountain set aside for snowboarders only , full of snow mounds that serve as jumps and a hollowedout halfpipe dug lengthwise into the surface of the snow for those who are good enough for flips , spins and other stunts though skiers and snowboarders often complain of pricey lift tickets and equipment rentals , the real robbery takes place before the trip even starts it happens when shopping for ski apparel if you talk to the commissionoriented sales staff at most sports stores and gravitate toward the products labeled as specially made for snowboarders , it can easily cost 1 , 000 to buy the clothing you need to be warm , dry and safe a burton duolite parka with advanced snowsealing enclosures \( 220 \) smith classic goggles with fogx \( 60 \) directgrip goretex gloves \( 100 \) snow pants with removable kneepads \( 180 \) a wool sweater \( 100 to 200 \) long underwear with moisturewicking fabric and other clothes for layering \( 100 to 200 \) forwardlean socks and silkblend sock liners \( 25 \) , and a mossimo hat \( 25 \) a waterproof outfit put together by scavenging department stores , vintage shops and friends' closets can look just as good and function just as well on the slopes , minus only the brand names though there are some quaint old inns and hotels 20 minutes from stratton in the town of manchester , we chose to stay closer to the slopes , at the mountain s own condos for those who reserve early and are willing to pay a little extra , a condo can be rented so close to the mountain that you can literally ski to the chairlifts ours was a comfortable but genericlooking affair with two bedrooms , a nicesize kitchen , a living room and a stone fireplace though 300 a night was steep , it included lift tickets for the four of us \( normally 49 a weekend per person \) and free passes to the stratton sports club , where those who have n't had enough exercise can swim and play tennis and those who are exhausted can relax in the sauna or get a massage hit the slopes , dude having become something of an expert in beginner hills , i can say that stratton s was among the best it was long and evenly sloped , which is an advantage over , say , mount snow s , which is so small that you hardly have time to learn anything on the way down stratton s is also shielded by trees from the rest of the trail , so that beginners are n't knocked over by experts though snowboarding magazines offer hundreds of photographs of riders flying through the air as if jetpropelled , they never capture one of snowboarding s equally striking images the tangle of bodies on the ground invariably found at the exit of the beginnerhill chairlift exiting a chairlift on a snowboard can be harder than traversing a mountain because only one of your feet is strapped into the board when you 're not heading downhill , making maneuvering on the tiny exit ramp a difficult balancing act the ski and snowboard school is at the base of the bunny hill , which is where my friends and i signed up for 25 group lessons after renting boots and an allpurpose snowboard called a freestyle board for 31 a person though snowboarding has been around since 1969 , when a utah surfer named dimitrije milovich tried to find a way to entertain himself in the winter , it began entering the popular consciousness in the mid1980 s now , at stratton , almost every teenager and about onethird of everybody else had snowboards strapped to their feet more so than in skiing , owning your own equipment for snowboarding can

big , loud , pushy and intimidating , hildy esterhazy has a lot in common with the hell of a town where she works as a taxi driver that s new york city , or to be more specific , the manhattan of the 1944 musical classic on the town , and whatever their status in other places , these traits are virtues in manhattan as embodied by a hitherto littleknown actress named lea delaria , hildy makes it clear that big , loud and pushy can also be the elements of fullstrength showbiz magnetism in the very mixed blessing of george c wolfe s revival of the show for the new york shakespeare festival , which opened last night at the delacorte theater in central park , ms delaria comes to represent the irresistible , brazen essence of the city being celebrated in this buoyant wartime offering from leonard bernstein , betty comden and adolph green hitting on a scrawny sailor onethird her width , this cabby somehow makes steamroller tactics sexy and when she opens her mouth to sing , the notes come stomping out like a cocky , allbrass band , bringing to mind an ethel merman with attitude like the town of the show s title , ms delaria makes vulgarity a highly developed art a confrontational comic from the frontier land of lesbian standup comedy , ms delaria is n't an obvious choice for hildy , a role created by nancy walker but mr wolfe has deliberately avoided using familiar stars here he hopes , he has said , to recreate the sense of youthful freshness and surprise that captivated broadway when on the town arrived in new york half a century ago , the work of a quartet of young , impudent talents \( jerome robbins was the choreographer \) who would all become legends of the american arts certainly with ms delaria s performance , mr wolfe has achieved his ambition and the very look of the show , which pushes period style into a hyperreal spectrum of exaggerated colors and shapes , is an energizing eye opener moreover , mr wolfe s characteristic use of a diverse , multiethnic cast seems especially fitting here , matching the swirling melting pot that is bernstein s score but while the production bubbles into moments of undiluted joy , it cannot sustain the requisite heady momentum , as mr wolfe s hit bring in da noise bring in da funk does and it often has a softness around the edges when it should be switchblade sharp this is partly because the cast is jarringly unbalanced partly because mr wolfe seems perceptibly ambivalent about reinventing a modern classic , three of whose creators are very much alive but there s another , more important factor as a dance show , this on the town has two left feet dance is more crucial than the show s sketch of a book in creating a sense of forward motion town began life as a ballet by the young mr robbins called fancy free , which portrayed three sailors on a giddy shore leave in manhattan when it was translated into a book musical , the dancing remained , with traditionbreaking boldness , at the show s center mr wolfe , in his desire to avoid a museumpiece atmosphere , has chosen not to reconstruct mr robbins s vital work instead , he has brought in eliot feld , a choreographer celebrated for his inventive melding of modern and classical forms but here mr feld s dance numbers , and they are long and many , perversely seem to stall the show when they should be hurtling it forward they give off a haphazard , oddly ruminative quality , with a lot of rolling shoulders and sliding feet that can sometimes suggest the ensemble is improvising on the spot as a consequence , the show starts to seem like an appealingly flashy car that you ca n't wait to ride in until you discover that it does n't have a motor this lack of choreographic glue is all the more frustrating because so much else in the show is a pleasure certainly , your first glimpse of adrianne lobel s set creates great expectations , with its dazzling centerpiece of a 120footlong steel bridge that , an ideal frame for the park behind it , seems to pull the city onto the stage this bridge is also where the orchestra sits , turning bernstein s symphonic , jazzflavored score into an urban heartbeat and when the show begins , with a drowsy workman \( the sterlingvoiced bass , luizottavio faria \) , reluctantly greeting the sunrise in front of the brooklyn navy yard , you ca n't wait to see how the musical metaphor for one day in the life of a city is worked out what follows over the next two and a half hours , while consistently enlivened by paul tazewell s vivid , gumballcolored costumes and ms lobel s witty evocations of tourist postcards , is alternately exhilarating and deflating as you probably know , on the town tells the story of a trio of wartime sailors on 24hour leave in manhattan , determined to milk it for every available thrill they fall in love , of course ozzie \( robert montano \) , the selfstyled ladies' man , with the loopy anthropologist claire deloone \( kate suber \) chip \( jesse tyler ferguson , the most appealing and natural of the three \) , a norman rockwell type from peoria , with ms delaria s hildy the cabby , and gabey \( jose llana \) , the dreamiest of the three , with the picture of a young woman named ivy smith \( sophia salguero \) , who has been chosen to be miss turnstiles , the poster girl of the subway system
washington , july 9 senators investigating campaign finance abuses announced today that they had learned that attorney general janet reno would object if their committee offered immunity from prosecution to john huang , whose moneyraising practices are at the heart of the inquiry for that and other reasons , many of the senators expressed serious reservations about granting mr huang immunity , raising new doubts today about whether he would ever appear to testify ms reno s views , later confirmed by the justice department , and those of the senators were aired as the committee took testimony from its first public witness , richard sullivan , who as finance director of the democratic national committee during last year s election campaign was mr huang s boss as mr sullivan testified , renewed rancor erupted within the house committee that is preparing for its own set of public hearings on campaign finance that committee s democratic minority complained of an unwarranted focus by the republicans on former associate attorney general webster l hubbell and said it demonstrated that the house inquiry had spun out of control \( page b9 \) answering the senators' questions , mr sullivan described at length how mr huang was hired by the party as a fundraiser after president clinton s intervention , despite the misgivings of some party officials \( excerpts from the testimony , page b8 \) the 33yearold witness , a democratic political operative who is studying for the bar examination , was also questioned about matters like the white house s use of coffees and lincoln bedroom sleepovers as fundraising tools and vice president al gore s appearance at a buddhist temple where money for the party was solicited none of the testimony went beyond details already published at a news conference in madrid , where he was attending a nato conference , mr clinton acknowledged that he had recommended that mr huang be hired by the party but said he could not remember whom he had spoken with most people do n't volunteer to help you raise money in this world , the president said it s normally an onerous task and so with anybody who volunteered , i would have referred virtually anybody s name to the party but i had had some acquaintance with him for several years , going back to my service as governor so i knew who he was on another question before the committee , the president said he knew nothing of any effort by the chinese government to influence the american electoral process last year senator fred thompson of tennessee , the committee chairman , said on tuesday that investigators had uncovered clear evidence of such a plot by the chinese it is a serious charge , the president said if any country sought to influence policy through illegal means , including illegal campaign contributions to people running for president or people in the congress , it would be wrong and a matter of serious concern but i simply do n't know and i think we have to let the investigation play itself out after today s session before the senate panel , the committee on governmental affairs , republican members and their investigators seemed disappointed that the leadoff witness of their public hearings had not been more forthcoming , especially concerning worry by himself and other party officials about the potential for trouble when mr huang joined the party s fundraising staff citing excerpts from depositions they took from mr sullivan last month , the investigators suggested that what he said today was far more cautious some had clearly hoped that mr sullivan would be to this investigation what john w dean 3d was to the watergate inquiry an insider who spilled the beans the republican senators , mindful of federal law that bars political fundraising on government property , seemed particularly frustrated by mr sullivan s insistence that the coffees over which mr clinton presided at the white house all last year were not fundraisers senator pete v domenici , republican of new mexico , produced a memorandum mr sullivan wrote in july 1995 that listed several coffees this exchange followed q do you see where it says , dnc fundraising dates \? a yes q and then it says , president of the united states that means the president is going to be at the coffee , right \? a yes q and then there are several dates described as coffees you see those and these coffees are the same ones we always hear about at the white house is that right \? a i believe so q and this document describes them taking place on fundraising dates is n't that correct \? a yes q so they were really fundraisers , were n't they \? a senator , the coffees helped us with our fundraising i was the fundraising director but they were not fundraisers they were not fundraisers q they were not fundraisers , as you see it , and at least testify here \? a that s correct q in spite of the fact that the dnc called them fundraising dates , in spite of the fact that the memo from various of the hierarchy from you says fundraising dates , they were n't fundraisers a that s correct q ok a the coffees were a tool in helping us motivate and energize the people that we needed to motivate and energize to help us raise the 130 million that we wanted to raise mr sullivan s testimony is to resume on thursday morning
judge harold baer jr has long lamented that the naturalization ceremonies in which new citizens swear their allegiance to this country are dry and lifeless affairs , with none of the soulstirring pomp befitting such momentous civic occasions the thought struck him again this week as he faced an unusual criminal defendant in federal district court in manhattan the man , bernard zeller , an immigrant himself , was originally charged with smuggling rare 18thcentury violins into the country from germany in hopes of reselling them judge baer took a stern view of the case , and thought mr zeller , who ultimately pleaded guilty to two charges , including making false statements to customs agents , could use a refresher course in citizenship and since mr zeller happens to be an accomplished concert violinist and has taught music , the judge hit on what he thought was the perfect punishment besides a 10 , 000 fine , he ordered mr zeller to come , violin in hand , to the naturalization ceremonies to play in honor of the hundreds of new citizens sworn in each week i think that those programs are now , to say the least , lackluster , in my view , the judge told mr zeller , according to a transcript of the hearing on wednesday having a violinist of your caliber doing a solo , with or without an accompanying vocalist , would probably do a great deal for all concerned , judge baer said the judge said the violinplaying would be part of 250 hours of community service to be performed by mr zeller over two years neither mr zeller nor his lawyer would comment on the sentence yesterday but in court on wednesday , mr zeller told the judge , i fully recognized that i made bad mistakes i do n't have anything to offer to this court to justify my mistakes , he added judge baer s idea of enlisting mr zeller is not the first time he has tried to bring some pizazz to the naturalization ceremonies last year , when judge baer himself presided over the swearingsin , he invited the soprano marvis martin of the metropolitan opera to sing the starspangled banner and america the beautiful otherwise , he said in an interview yesterday , there s nobody singing , nobody playing judge baer said in court wednesday that he thought the false statements charge was very , very significant , and that in imposing a 10 , 000 fine he had exceeded the federal sentencing guidelines the violins in question were found in mr zeller s luggage after he returned from a trip abroad in early 1994 according to a complaint brought by the united states attorney s office in manhattan , mr zeller said that the violins were his , that he had used them in a concert abroad and that they were worth a total of about 60 , 000 but a customs investigation found that the three violins were actually rare antiques built in the 1700 s by carlo bergonzi , g b guadagnini , and nicolaus amati all from famous violinmaking italian families , according to the court papers they place the value of the three violins at approximately 15 million the complaint contends that mr zeller obtained the violins from dealers in germany with the intent to resell them here and collect a commission mr zeller had also pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to report on his tax returns that he had a foreign bank account judge baer said in court that mr zeller would come to play the violin at the behest of my colleagues and myself in yesterday s interview , the judge added he s an immigrant himself i thought it would be meaningful to him as well as everybody else the judge said in the interview that he had no idea just what kind of music mr zeller should play at the ceremony but he hoped it would replicate the thrill of hearing the met soprano in the court last year having her do it was terribly creative , he said very , very exciting

mexico city , may 28 the amount of cash in circulation in mexico has recently been rising , increasing suspicion that the government may be moving to prime the economic pump before legislative and local elections this summer but independent analysts say that despite the intense political pressure in advance of the elections , scheduled for july 6 , the mexican government has largely refrained from relaxing its economic policies to curry voter favor i ca n't say there is absolutely no election spending , said deborah reiner , chief economist at the american chamber of commerce here but i do n't see anything that indicates the government has deviated in any important way it s pretty impressive that they have stayed so much on track the institutional revolutionary party , or pri , which has ruled mexico for decades , is facing the most competitive voting in modern times polls show that the leftist opposition leader , cuauhtemoc cardenas , is ahead in the race for mayor of mexico city , and the pri could lose its sixdecadelong majority in the lower house of congress given that pressure , and the history of misleading status reports and behindthescenes fiddling by mexican officials in electoral seasons , analysts said it might not have come as a surprise if president ernesto zedillo had strayed from the tight economic policies that restored mexico s fiscal stability after the financial crisis of 1995 , which eroded mexicans' everyday living standards over the years the government has earned the right to have everyone doubt it , wrote jonathan heath , an economist who has been critical of mr zedillo , in a newspaper column published this week nevertheless , in this specific case , i tend to believe the official explanation central bank officials abandoned their customary silence last week to respond to reports suggesting that they were injecting cash into the economy the amount of money in mexicans' pockets increased more than the bank forecast because the economy grew by an unexpected 51 percent in the first quarter , explained jose julian sidaoui , a deputy governor of the bank several unusually long holidays , including mother s day on may 10 , came close together this year , making the demand for cash especially high , the officials said we like to give presents and flowers on mother s day , mr sidaoui said he acknowledged that the political campaigns had also affected demand for pesos , but only because more mexicans were being paid in cash for political work than the bank anticipated but none of this , he said , is intended to artificially stimulate the economy mr sidaoui said the central bank could react if inflationary pressure arose , exclusively based on economic conditions the government s economic program has gotten an endorsement from the currency markets , where the peso has been unusually stable in recent months , and from a generally rising stock market the peso has been hovering just below 8 to the dollar since the beginning of the year , settling in new york late this afternoon at 79030 to the dollar if money had been artificially pumped into the economy , a decline might be expected in the value of the peso , and then a surge in inflation , which has been held in check the peso has been sustained in part by a big influx of foreign capital , economists said the american chamber of commerce estimates there had been 25 billion in direct foreign investment in mexico in the first quarter of this year we believe the currency is appropriately valued at this stage , said lawrence goodman , chief of latin american research at salomon brothers by no means has president zedillo remained aloof from the electoral fray in his frequent travel outside the capital , he trumpets his success in pulling mexico out of its deepest economic slump in decades and in restarting growth his government planned a 93 percent social spending increase in real terms for 1997 it is building schools , roads , electrical grids and health clinics at a brisk pace the most generous social spending as a percentage of the budget that mexico has seen in the last 10 years government officials have said privately in recent days they were projecting a slightly larger budget deficit than previously expected nor has the central bank stayed completely out of the peso market in a series of auctions , the bank has been buying dollars to build up mexico s reserves , which have reached 217 billion , the highest level since the '95 crisis but that does not seem to have undermined the peso s value , and the healthy reserves suggest that the government is in an improved position to stanch any run on the currency still , the recovery , which has taken hold mainly in northern regions where thriving export industries are centered , has not yet reached the majority of voting mexicans people are still in crisis , said sergio martin moreno , economist for ing barings in mexico city the government has done a very good job in stabilizing the economy , he said but for people in general , that s very difficult to recognize
after seven years of court battles over whether he is crazy or crazy like a fox , vincent gigante is to go on trial tomorrow on charges that he ordered murders and led rackets as a powerful mafia boss prosecutors say , and two federal judges have agreed , that mr gigante , 69 , feigned mental illness for decades to avoid prosecution but mr gigante s lawyers insist that his behavior strolling through his former greenwich village neighborhood in a bathrobe and pajamas and mumbling incoherently is not the calculated performance the united states attorney s office in brooklyn claims , but a true manifestation of mental illness that has grown worse he s sick , said mr gigante s brother , the rev louis gigante , a roman catholic priest and formerly a member of the new york city council now a jury will be asked to decide for itself whether mr gigante s actions are ruse or reality last week in a pretrial session , a defense lawyer , michael a marinaccio , said the defense would offer testimony that mr gigante lacked the mental capacity to do the things that the informants will testify he was doing mr marinaccio also said he would cite what he called a significant lack of proof connecting mr gigante to any of these homicides mr gigante is accused of ordering or conspiring in the killings of seven people during gangland disputes in new york and philadelphia in the early 1980 s , of unsuccessfully plotting more killings in the late 80 s and early 90 s including that of his archrival , john gotti and of being a leader in schemes including bidrigging on window work on city housing projects mr gigante is known in the underworld as chin , a nickname derived from his first name , vincenzo law enforcement officials hold that since the early 1980 s , he has reigned as head of the genovese crime family mr gigante is free on 1 million bail and living at the upper east side home of his longtime girlfriend he has attended only two of the many pretrial proceedings in the case , in which prosecution and defense psychiatrists have clashed over whether he suffers from a disorder like schizophrenia or a dementia stemming from alzheimer s or vascular disease he was too sick to attend the other sessions not only because of his mental illness , his lawyers said , but also because of heart ailments but last week , they said they wanted the jury to see him it is our intention to have mr gigante appear in court each and every day during the trial , mr marinaccio told judge jack b weinstein of federal district court in brooklyn , who will preside last week , judge weinstein rejected defense motions to put off the trial on new medical grounds including the purported discovery of potentially cancerous nodules on mr gigante s thyroid gland biopsy results are expected this week and a report of malignancy would no doubt spur a motion for adjournment after appearing at his arraignment when he was arrested in 1990 , mr gigante did not show up in court again until ordered to do so for a pretrial proceeding last september , after the judge previously handling the case , eugene h nickerson , ruled that he had been feigning insanity and was competent to stand trial at that time , looking gaunt and disheveled , mr gigante stumbled into the courtroom on the arm of a doctor who was conspicuously holding a black medical bag throughout the proceeding , mr gigante moved his lips incessantly judge weinstein made clear that he wanted none of that at the trial if he is going to be here , i want him properly attired , shaven and barbered , the judge ordered last week any medical person on hand to monitor mr gigante s blood pressure , he added , was to be in civiian clothes rather than a white smock , without a stethoscope hanging around his or her neck the judge has authorized an anonymous jury and ordered lawyers not to discuss the case publicly the prosecution evidence is expected to include fbi testimony and most important testimony by former mobsters turned government informers the most prominent of these will be salvatore gravano , who was second to mr gotti before he testified against him in a 1992 trial the trial brought mr gotti a conviction and a life sentence the same sentence mr gigante will face if he is found guilty
john f welch jr , one of the most successful and highly compensated chief executives in corporate america , is about to be asked to defend how much he is paid to run the general electric company a shareholder resolution seeking to eliminate a form of deferred compensation for mr welch , ge s chairman and chief executive , will be in the proxy statement that ge is expected to mail to shareholders in the next few days the resolution , brought by a pension plan of the international brotherhood of teamsters , calls for placing a 1 million limit on the base salaries of ge s five top executives it is intended to challenge a 1995 arrangement under which mr welch deferred half of his 2 million base salary until retirement in return for a promise to receive generous interest payments on the balance ge directors will recommend that shareholders reject the proposal , which will be voted on on april 23 in charlotte , nc , at the company s annual meeting we feel it would undermine our ability to retain and attract leaders in the future , said vance meyer , a ge spokesman we need the flexibility to develop competitive individual compensation plans the managers of the teamsters pension plan said they learned of mr welch s deferred compensation agreement from an article in the new york times that was part of a series late last year the article detailed the ways many wealthy americans manage to reduce , delay or avoid taxes , using sophisticated techniques not generally available to most people the teamsters provided the times with an advance copy of the shareholder resolution and a letter from ge confirming that it would appear in the proxy statement the union filed a similar resolution with pepsico , whose chief executive , roger a enrico , deferred 13 million in 1994 another pepsico executive made 199 , 967 in 1995 in abovemarket interest on deferred compensation the teamsters said pepsico should disclose the interest rate paid pepsico , in a statement that will appear in its proxy in opposition to the resolution , said none of its executives' base pay exceeded 1 million and that the deferred amounts were entirely tax deductible teamsters' officials said they filed the resolutions as part of a campaign to draw attention to executive pay , which the union considers excessive as long as there are loophole lawyers , there need to be shareholder watchdogs and we still think a million dollars means something , said bart naylor , the union s director of corporate affairs mr welch , who owns ge stock worth more than 300 million , received total compensation over 22 million in 1995 the teamsters' resolution says deferred compensation is being used as a method of avoiding shareholder votes on compensation plans under a 1993 federal law , the maximum amount of base pay that a company can deduct from taxes for its top five executives is 1 million each there is no limit on how much a company can deduct if the pay is based on a payforperformance plan that was approved by a shareholder vote but base pay greater than 1 million qualifies for a tax deduction , even if it is not part of an approved payforperformance plan , if the money is deferred until retirement mr welch deferred half of his 2 million base salary until retirement in return for being paid 14 percent interest , which will compound untaxed until he retires mr welch also received a 35 , 000 sweetener payment , which also earns 14 percent interest , to encourage him to make the deferral if the deferral lasts five years mr welch will have 263 , 600 more , after taxes , than if he had found an investment on his own paying 14 percent interest the general electric resolution was proposed by the teamsters affiliates pension plan , which owns 13 , 800 shares of ge stock and covers top union officials all teamster plans together own 72 million ge shares , the union said , or less than onehalf of 1 percent of the nearly 165 billion ge shares outstanding ge sought permission from the securities and exchange commission in a dec 20 letter to ignore the union s resolution the sec denied the request , though it did require two minor changes last year , at least 63 shareholder resolutions on executive pay were submitted , according to the investor responsibility research center , which tracks proxy and other corporategovernance filings at 1 , 500 companies shareholders voted on 37 of these proposals all lost , on average receiving the support of 111 percent of the shares voted , the center said
sam moskowitz , an unlikely scholar widely regarded as the world s foremost authority on science fiction and by far its most devoted fan , died on april 15 at a hospital near his home in newark he was 76 and the author or editor of 62 books his wife , dr christine haycock , said the cause was a heart attack his russian immigrant parents were too poor to send him to college , but mr moskowitz , a native of newark who began his professional life driving a produce truck in the 1930 s and ended it in 1985 editing a trade publication known as quick frozen foods , could n't have learned much in college anyway from the moment he leafed through his first copy of astounding stories at his father s candy store when he was 12 , mr moskowitz s main interest in life was science fiction , a subject not offered in college in those days as indeed it would n't be until mr moskowitz himself taught the first course , at city college in 1953 by then mr moskowitz had established himself as an authority in a comparatively young field for although writers like h g wells and jules verne had been writing science fiction since the 19th century , it had not been regarded as a separate literary genre , or even given its name , until april 1926 , when an immigrant from luxembourg named hugo gernsback published the first issue of amazing stories , the first magazine devoted exclusively to what gernsback called scientifiction it was a measure of mr moskowitz s standing as a science fiction scholar that mr gernsback hired him off his produce truck in 1952 as an editor of his last magazine , science fiction plus he may not have been the first 12yearold to become obsessed with science fiction , but none pursued it so singlemindedly as mr moskowitz like other teenagers in the 1930 s he collected every science fiction magazine or book he could get his hands on , published his own fanzines , contributed to others and in 1939 helped organize the first world science fiction convention the world con , as it is known today , regularly attracts 10 , 000 fans mr moskowitz wrote few science fiction stories of his own from the beginning he was interested in science fiction as a fan , an especially learned fan who plumbed its history and development and wrote about it widely his first book , immortal storm \( 1954 \) , a collection of magazine articles tracing the development of the science fiction fan movement , was followed by an outpouring of anthologies , authors' biographies and other works , including fiction in old san francisco \( 1980 \) , which rediscovered an early strain of science fiction all but forgotten since the 1906 earthquake in time his interest and his collection broadened to include the entire range of pulp fiction , including mysteries and westerns , but his chief focus remained on science fiction , which formed the bulk of his collection of more than 40 , 000 books and magazines a widely read man with an almost photographic memory , he became a walking encyclopedia he could be counted on , for example , to counter a soviet claim that a russian author at the turn of the century had been the first to write about a manmade satellite by pointing out that edward everett hale , author of the man without a country , had envisioned an orbiting , slingshotlaunched missile in the brick moon , published in the atlantic in 1869 a highly gregarious man who was a favorite guest at innumerable science fiction conventions and club meetings , mr moskowitz lost his larynx to cancer some years ago , but after a period of initial hesitation became a more confident speaker than ever with the use of a vibrationamplifying device to mainstream literature , science fiction may remain an alien realm , but mr moskowitz , who received wide recognition within that field , made a breakthrough of sorts in 1987 when was he inducted into the new jersey literary hall of fame toward the end of his life mr moskowitz had read so much science fiction for so long and remembered it so well that when a friend kidded him one day , telling him that some young fellow was sure to come along who would know more about science fiction than he , mr moskowitz agreed , up to a point he wo n't be young , he said in addition to his wife , he is survived by two sisters , pearl moskowitz of arlington , va , and helen brown of wellington , fla , and three brothers , maurice , of mobile , ala , herman , of tom s river , nj , and alfred , of newark photo sam moskowitz \( john l coker 3d , 1995 \)
bear mountain , ny , sept 1 the allamerican smells of lighter fluid , burning charcoal briquets and sizzling hamburger lofted pleasantly up from a small forest of carnivores , none of them fearful of a new american threat , red meat was there a meat scare \? asked dionne gibson , 27 , a secretary from st albans , queens , who was grilling burgers at a church choir picnic yeah , the hudson thing , the callback , said ms gibson s friend heather dennis , a hunter college freshman ms gibson shrugged i like my meat , she said that was the consensus of a deeply unscientific poll of the labor day crowd at bear mountain park s hessian lake , a paddleboat pond surrounded by coils of grayishwhite barbecue smoke lazying up into the muggy air why would you come and cook anything but steak , hot dogs , chicken and hamburger \? said william greenaway , who was manning a large grill at the annual picnic of the salvation army adult rehabilitation centers in the bronx and hempstead , ny that s all part of the fun of labor day most of the lakeside meateaters did know about the closing of the hudson foods beef processing plant in nebraska last month , and also about its recall of 25 million pounds of ground beef from supermarkets and fastfood outlets , including burger king the recall was made after 16 people became ill in colorado after eating undercooked hamburger tainted with a lethal strain of bacterium , e coli 0157 h7 but no one at the lake seemed willing to let the recall cast a pall over the great american tradition of cooking meat outdoors on labor day it s not the same brand , said joan juarbe , 48 , an audit clerk from bayonne , nj , checking the label on her package of ground beef it s topps then she thought a moment but you know , the a p in bayonne put their chopped meat on half price i bought a big one for two dollars it said 'meat special' probably people were n't buying it i did n't think of that but a spot check of grocery stores in westchester county and on long island turned up no indication that meat sales were off the manager of a king kullen in mineola , on long island , said he had actually run out of ground beef in any case , ms juarbe , like everyone else at the lake , said she ate her meat well done me , i burn my food , said ms juarbe s husband , baltazar juarbe carol ketter , 26 , an engineering company administrator from the ocean hill section of brooklyn , was punching holes in the aluminum foil over her grill as she prepared to cook burgers for her family she said that she herself never ate ground beef but that she was feeding her husband and children they 'll eat anything , she said many people in the park , which stretches along the hudson river on the border of rockland and orange counties , were cooking meat far more interesting than hamburger min young you , a piano teacher from flushing , queens , had just finished preparing a korean specialty of sliced beef sauteed in sesame oil , salt and pepper miryam escobar , a housekeeper from tarrytown , ny , was enjoying grilled chorizo and tortillas and victor idrovo , a factory worker from belleville , nj , was preparing steak marinated in garlic and onions did he ever worry about getting ill from beef \? no , said mr idrovo , who is from ecuador never never do we get sick from meat , especially in this country his friend victor pastuizaca , a cook in an italian restaurant who is from belleville , had a different view disease is all over the country , he said what are you going to do \? you 're going to die anyway a number of barbecuers also said they were avoiding burger king for now and going to mcdonald s others said they were relying on safe sources of raw meat it comes from a reliable butcher , said charles hager , a salvation army administrator , speaking of the 12ounce ribeye steaks he would be grilling for dinner for the 200 salvation army picnickers they 're all meatandpotatoes men , said his wife , norma , a salvation army director
for the first time in more than a half century , a big league baseball team will make an appearance in connecticut when the minnesota twins play their doublea farm club , the new britain rock cats , at new britain stadium tomorrow afternoon all 6 , 146 seats at the twoyearold ball park are sold out for the seveninning game , which is scheduled to start at 3 pm and will be preceded by a home run hitting contest involving three players each from the twins and the rock cats gerry berthiaume , the general manager of the rock cats , says the starters for the twins , including future hall of famer paul molitor , are expected to play at least a few innings the exhibition game will be played 56 years to the day from the time when the st louis cardinals , then in the midst of a pennant race with the brooklyn dodgers , played a semiprofessional team in stamford earlier that summer the boston braves of the national league played an exhibition against their eastern league farm team , the hartford chiefs , in hartford four years later , says frank \( spec \) shea , a former new york yankee pitcher who lives in naugatuck , four major league clubs played an amateur team in waterbury as i recall , the philadelphia phillies , the brooklyn dodgers , the new york yankees and the boston braves all played in municipal stadium in september of 1945 , said shea , who spent nine seasons in the big leagues with the yankees and the washington senators fred davi , a local promoter who worked at us rubber in naugatuck , put together a team of players from the waterbury area , including me i had just got out of the army and was 40 pounds overweight , but they had me pitch against the yankees , and i shut them out , 10 , with relief in the ninth inning the yankee outfielder charley keller was so impressed with shea \( after striking out all three times he batted against him \) that he recommended that the yankees sign him , which they did the following winter after the game keller told me , 'i'm going to recommend you as soon as i get off the train in new york' , said shea , who went on to pitch for the yankees from 1947 to 1952 and for washington until 1955 when he retired , spending 20 years as the director of parks and recreation in his hometown of naugatuck shea s recollections are that the exhibition games that summer drew crowds of 12 , 000 to 15 , 000 to municipal stadium , but joe samoska , who managed the waterbury team , said that he remembered the crowds being around 5 , 000 at both games at any rate , said shea , there were no lights , so the games started at about 5 in the afternoon the twins' visit to new britain will be short one buses hired by the rock cats will pick up the parent team at the boston sheraton at 9 15 tomorrow morning and take the players to new britain stadium a few of the players , along with joe buzas , the owner of the rock cats and the twins' triplea farm team , the salt lake buzz , are scheduled to attend a lunch before the game we 're not sure if the twins will take batting practice , berthiaume said unfortunately for a stamford promoter named felix livolsi , the st louis cardinals did take batting practice during their first visit to the city for a night game on aug 4 , 1938 because of the poor temporary lights , livolsi decided to experiment with yellow baseballs on the theory that they would be easier to see but during batting practice , the cardinals , including such sluggers as johnny mize , enos slaughter and joe medwick , hit about half the balls over a temporary canvas fence that surrounded belltown field we would try to lose as many balls as possible both during batting practice and in the early innings so that we 'd eventually exhaust the supply and they 'd have to call the game , said terry moore , the cardinal centerfielder during both of the team s visits to stamford , in an interview before his death last year that way we could get some rest at the hotel before heading to the train station the scheme worked in the 1938 game , which had to be called when the supply of balls ran out in the ninth inning , by which time the cardinals had taken a 204 lead over a stamford team made up mainly of men who worked in factories and , indeed , had gone directly from their jobs to belltown field for the big game it was a big thrill playing against a big league team like the cardinals , said joseph \( jake \) deleo , who played half the game at second base for the stamford all stars but we were very nervous deleo remembers batting against pepper martin , who was normally a third baseman and outfielder , but who would come in during the late innings of exhibition games and entertain crowds with an array of trick pitches he 'd throw the ball over his shoulder , through his legs and so on , deleo said and he was hard to hit , especially with those lights while playing in the outfield , martin once beamed a flashlight toward the sky while chasing a fly ball to dramatize the inadequacy of the lights the lights were better , and so was the stamford team , when the cardinals returned for another exhibition game three years later this time , the game was played at mitchell field , across from cummings park in stamford but , as at belltown field , there were no dugouts and the players had to sit on benches , where they were clearly visible to the capacity crowds such visits by major league teams were a huge event , not only in connecticut but elsewhere , even though the exhibitions were anathema to the players
kaithwari , india with monsoon rains sheeting down outside , dawa chand has passed many days recently in his tiny , darkened tentmaker s shop in this north indian village , stitching bunting to flutter over village rooftops on the 50th anniversary of india s independence at midnight on aug 14 , 1947 as he has pedaled his treadle sewing machine , mr chand , 31 , has considered what india s half century as a free country has meant to people like himself , villagers who account for nearly threequarters of the country s 970 million people the question goes to the heart of india s nationhood , since it was in the country s 650 , 000 villages that mohandas k gandhi , who led the independence struggle , found what he considered to be india s soul mr chand strikes a note of optimism , crediting free india with achieving more for people like himself , an untouchable at the lowest rung of india s social hierarchy , than has been acknowledged by many of the country s critics we are still backward , of course , but we are moving forward , and we owe this to the mahatma , he said , referring to gandhi , a champion of the untouchables because of him , people like myself are making progress our fathers and grandfathers never imagined in the myriad voices that have been raised in india in its 50th year , there have been many like mr chand s , full of satisfaction for what the decades of independence have brought many others have been filled with doubt and recrimination but perhaps the largest number of indians have reacted with ambivalence , unsure of how to take the measure of a country so vast , so populous and so diverse that is has always defied attempts to define it should indians celebrate that their country , a grand tapestry of castes , languages , regions and faiths , has survived despite forecasts that it would splinter once britain s controlling hand was removed \? or do they despair because inherent strains have spawned secessionist movements and other forms of violence that have made india one of the most lethal places on earth \? should indians take pride in their parliamentary democracy , vigorously upheld in a world where countries with far fewer problems have remained stifled by autocracy \? or should they lament the failures in their system , the demagogues who have risen to power on the votes of illiterate masses only to betray them , the politicians at every level who have built lives of sybaritic comfort for themselves while 350 million indians remain mired in poverty \? in recent years , there has been another conundrum , the huge gap that has emerged between the new india of high technology , and the old india of the bullock cart in bombay , new delhi , calcutta , madras and scores of other cities , an economy is emerging based on computers , rapid jet travel , airconditioned hotels and mobile telephones this economy s new middle class numbers in the tens of millions , yet it exists in an uneasy symbiosis with an india where tens of millions of others cannot afford medicine when they are sick and send their tiny children into the street to bang on car windows for coins in weighing these contrasts , indians are asking what matters more , that a country once racked by famines is now feeding itself and even exporting grain , or the crushing levels of illiteracy , disease and poverty that remain india s scourge \? as indians search for answers , many cannot even agree on what standard they should use should they compare india now to the india of 50 years ago or to the accomplishments of a dozen more prosperous asian nations , most of which india dwarfs in complexity and size \? these contradictions , apparent everywhere in india , were plainly evident in the differing attitudes towards the independence anniversary in kaithwari the village s 5 , 000 residents include a dominant minority of landowners , uppercaste families who still rule the roost , but it also has lowcaste families who have found a small measure of prosperity that their families never previously knew there is also a large block of families , at least a third of the village , who are still desperately poor mr chand , the tentmaker , is an obvious case of success the son of an illiterate cattletrader , he won a lowercaste scholarship from the government to attend college in meerut , an old british garrison city close to this village in western uttar pradesh state , then returned home after graduation to set up his business his income from the shop and running a village post office is 130 a month , a fortune to the village s poor but among mr chand s neighbors , there are some who have never traveled outside the village , never used a telephone and never had anybody in their family who stayed in school long enough to learn to read or write in one muddy courtyard , a group of 25 muslims , in rural india often poorer even than the poorest hindus , said that the four generations of their family were living off a combined income of 50 a month , and that none of them had owned even a bicycle , a sewing machine or a radio , the first luxuries for india s poor
melbourne , australia , sunday , jan 26 the class act outdid the novelty act today at the australian open topseeded pete sampras , who chases grand slam titles the way thoroughbreds chase the finish line , earned his ninth grand slam singles championship with a 62 , 63 , 63 demolition of unseeded carlos moya i had a great stay i look forward to coming back every year of my career , said sampras , who needs just three more grand slam titles to tie roy emerson s record dozen moya , a 20yearold spaniard who had become this event s glamour boy , was appearing in his first grand slam final in four previous grand slam tournaments , he had never passed the second round sampras , who won this title in 1994 and came into the australian having won the united states open last september , now has a daunting 92 record in grand slam finales though moya had insisted he would not enter this final feeling like a loser , sampras made sure the newcomer felt like one when he left it where sampras seized the occasion , moya was overwhelmed by it , and he played tentatively from start to finish of the 87minute match sampras , who wore a big white cap to block the hazy sun , needed just 12 aces to control moya , who keeps his tresses under control with a big white headband moya made 18 unforced errors , and was bombarded by an unrelenting attack from sampras , who was 6 for 6 on breakpoint conversions moya showed few signs of the allcourt brilliance , and insouciance , that carried him into this final he showed why he s no 1 in the world , moya said of sampras , whose allcourt game moya has used as inspiration in his own attempt to transcend his clay court heritage in the first set , sampras was clearly the maestro , conducting moya from corner to corner , serving him off the court and , in the fourth game , taking control from the backcourt at break point for a 31 lead sampras kept applying pressure and kept being rewarded with nervous errors , such as the unforced netted backhand that cost moya his serve and the first set sampras got off to a 20 lead in the second set and then lost his break by losing serve in the third game but he got it back by breaking moya again in the eighth game looking like a little boy who had lost his way as he headed to the net at break point , moya popped two forehand volleys directly onto sampras s racquet and , stuck at midcourt , watched sampras pass him with a crisp forehand into the vacant backcourt that game put sampras in position to serve for the second set at 53 , and a forehand return that dropped just long put moya in a twosetstonone abyss moya fared no better in the third set , where he lost his serve and fell behind , 21 , by burying in the net an anxious forehand , a shot he usually flicks across to perfection sampras forged to a 42 lead by ending the sixth game with a pair of aces , and went ahead by 53 with three aces the shaken moya then lost the final game without winning a point the 6foot3inch moya , who is two inches taller than sampras , held just two prior titles , both earned on clay , compared with 44 for sampras and the american s prowess on hardcourts created an even more startling disparity in experience sampras entered this final with a 27057 hardcourts match record moya , whose hardcourts career began just last year , took an unimposing 136 record into the final moya was the youngest australian open men s finalist since 19yearold stefan edberg burst onto the grand slam scene with a championship here in 1985 and moya was the first spanish man to reach the final since andres gimeno was beaten by rod laver in 1969 , the year laver completed his second career sweep of the four slam crowns though moya did not look like a worldbeater today , his campaign here vaulted him to a careerhigh rank of ninth in the world moya came into this tournament a virtual unknown but became , in the space of a single firstround victory , a cult hero teenage girls took up his cause , and the local gay community , which used to put its support behind edberg , jumped on the moya bandwagon during its annual midsumma festival , which runs concurrently with the open the crowd , what can i say about the crowd , said moya without your support i would n't have gotten here take a clint eastwoodsize body , a flashy headband and a full mane of dark hair , add a flamboyant forehand , and suddenly a tennis sex symbol was launched i'm glad of any support the peoples here have been so nice about me , said the slightly embarrassed moya , whose nature is as unassuming as his game is loaded with machismo but this thing happens overnight before , i am unknown , and now everyone knows who i am because i am the one who beat the big champion the fact that his first round fiveset manifesto happened to come at the expense of the defending champion , boris becker , instantly made a celebrity of the unseeded and hitherto unsung moya when he made his australian open debut last year , it was unceremonious he lost in the first round , and it was a lonely loss last year i came here to get experience , and the other spanish guys did n't want to come so far to play on hardcourts but i think you have to lose in the first round once before you can get to a final , said moya , who travels , practices , and lives amongst a troupe of barcelonabased claycourt compatriots this year all of moya s pals made the journey , and a record three of them 14thseeded felix mantilla , 10thseeded albert costa and the 25thranked moya reached the quarterfinal round but moya was the solitary spaniard to pass that round , and in the semifinals he proved his dethroning of becker had been no fluke by trouncing secondseeded michael chang , last year s runnerup to becker , in straight sets moya called that 75 , 62 , 64 victory the best match of his career , and it vaulted him into his first grand slam final against the seasoned , but wary , sampras unwilling to let moya come into this match any fresher than he was , the topranked sampras made mincemeat of his semifinal opponent , too , in his case austria s rugged thomas muster , who bowed in straight sets sampras said he would n't treat the neophyte lightly those spaniards are rough , he said , having gained recent knowledge of that in his fiveset quarterfinal against costa he s a little more powerful than thomas it s a matter of holding all my serves match points in the mixed doubles final , thirdseeded rick leach and manon bollegraf outlasted unseeded johnlaffnie de jager and larisa neiland , 63 , 67 \( 57 \) , 75 this was the seventh grand slam doubles title for the 32yearold leach of laguna beach , calif , who twice won the men s doubles title here with his former partner , jim pugh , in 1988 and 1989 photo pete

the compleat conductor by gunther schuller 571 pp new york oxford university press 4995 this is not only a hugely informative book but , its author would have us think , a worrying one gunther schuller has spent many hundreds of hours listening score and pencil in hand to dozens of recordings of each of eight works from the standard orchestral repertory two beethoven symphonies , two by brahms , one each by schumann and tchaikovsky , strauss s till eulenspiegel and , lone representative of the 20th century , the second suite from ravel s daphnis et chloe the point of his dedicated research was to examine how the practitioners of several decades have measured up to a philosophy of conducting that he asserts many times , with all the considerable force of his rhetoric , as in this passage from early on there ought to be a sense of moral obligation , a sense of unalterable respect for the great literature comprising our western musical heritage a sense that the art of conducting must be seen as a sacred trust to translate into a meaningful expressive acoustical reality , with as much insight and fidelity as is humanly possible , those musical documents the scores , the texts left us by the great composers the score , then , is the first word and the last no performance can be judged acceptable if it flouts the score s prescriptions in any detail metronome markings must be taken as a guide to tempo crescendos must start and stop as marked only then can the work of interpretation begin , concerning itself with matters unresolved by the score nuances of stress , phrasing , dynamics , color , rhythmic flexibility and so on mr schuller does not concern himself with these for him , the conductor will be compleat who realizes what is printed in the score compleat and at liberty then to make other decisions according to taste and good judgment so how do they measure up , these musicians from the archives arturo toscanini , bruno walter , wilhelm furtwangler , herbert von karajan , leonard bernstein , fritz reiner , leopold stokowski and others , down to such presentday maestros as christoph von dohnanyi , claudio abbado and john eliot gardiner \? not well at the close of a hundred pages on brahms s first symphony , for example , in which schuller has labored through all kinds of errors of tempo , rhythm , balance and dynamic , he shakes his head it is staggering and i can well believe that many readers will read my findings in disbelief to realize that a masterpiece as virtually perfect as this great symphony could be so consistently abused and misused , misunderstood and misinterpreted , its myriad notational details cavalierly ignored oh dear it would seem that , even with so many recordings of this work in the catalogue , there is room for a compleat conductor surely this should be mr schuller himself to rescue it from the ravages of the rampant egotists and reveal for the first time the whole splendor of the score there is even the strong possibility that none of these great works , mainstays of our culture , have ever been played properly at all , except in performances of schuller s own , to which he several times refers before accepting this bothersome conclusion , though , we need to examine his criteria , for it may be that he is using a fishing net to capture sunbeams , and is then surprised by the meagerness of his haul powerful clues that this may be so come from within the book in what is perhaps his most disturbing passage , schuller states that many of his former heroes \( furtwangler , toscanini , klemperer and walter are those he identifies \) have fallen from their high pedestals in the light of the close , critical scrutiny to which i have subjected their recordings we have to assume that his former admiration was not some fickle enthusiasm but the response of a highly intelligent , highly trained , highly cultured musician , for he remarks more than once on his qualifications as conductor , orchestral hornist , composer , record producer and publisher we have to assume , also , that the performances of his heroes were once deeply satisfying and meaningful to him so are those satisfactions and meanings now to be discounted because of discrepancies from what is printed in the score \? the viewpoint schuller wants to present urges yes , but still occasionally one can detect a quieter voice pleading no he breaks off , for instance , from reporting the injustices inflicted on beethoven s fifth symphony \( well over a hundred pages \) to voice vigorous approval of carlos kleiber , concluding that whatever he does , he does with such consummate control , gesturally and intellectually , and with such a joy of music making , ranging from complete confidencebuilding relaxation in front of an orchestra to passionate , almost ecstatic outbursts , that one can only be compelled to admire in awe yet we have earlier learned that this same kleiber is very much an incompleat conductor there was a murderous fortissimo from the timpanist at one point in the first movement of the beethoven fifth , an unaskedfor deceleration a little later , another tempo distortion soon after that , then an absence of wind tone , and so on how come , with all these faults , he gets into the pantheon , which indeed he seems to have almost to himself , perhaps with only schuller for company \? the reason is that he goes for the grand line , the large shape and the clarification of inherent structure \( s \) even because he is not \( or elects not to be \) conscious of every detail in a score
philadelphia , feb 7 fearing that armed robbers had taken hostages , the police locked 121 people inside a checkcashing agency here for more than three hours today at least one gunman was inside , but the incident ended peacefully when the police concluded that he had fled the customers and employees began walking out the front doors of the business , the financial exchange , one at a time at 2 45 pm , and heavily armed swat officers hustled them behind bulletproof shields , where they were searched then they rode buses to local police headquarters for questioning the police commissioner , richard neal , said all customers would be questioned to insure that none of the bad guys had been posing as customers in an effort to escape two men were arrested as they came out of the checkcashing

police that the people inside were apparently safe ms hill pressed a note against the agency s glass windows , overlooking the street , that read no guard no guns she later said i was more afraid of the police out there kids were crying as the customers and employees remained locked inside , mr neal said , the police decided at 1 10 pm to enter ms ruiz s home , where they found the children and the others unharmed and huddled in the basement but no gunman ninety minutes later , the police began to allow the people at the checkcashing agency to leave , searching each one nearly all the customers were women several people were weeping one elderly woman with tears streaming down her face was taken out on a stretcher it was our belief that there were bad guys in the place , mr neal

arthur j cutler , whose small empire of popular , conceptually unusual restaurants made a distinctive mark on the new york dining business , died on wednesday at his home in great neck , ny he was 53 he had a heart attack while sleeping , said his wife , alice cutler mr cutler ranged far and wide in the kinds of restaurants he conceived , in the places he built them , and in the partners he chose in 1990 , he opened carmine s , an oldfashioned , familystyle italian restaurant , on broadway near 91st street , at a time when nobody wanted to open above 86th street carmine s served huge platters of spaghetti and meatballs , rivers of marinara sauce and mountains of garlic at a time when the trend in italian restaurants was toward elevating the image of the cuisine with extravirgin oils , aged vinegars and cheese made from buffalo milk he opened ollie s noodle shop and grille , a chinatownstyle restaurant featuring noodles and roast meats , when other uptown chinese restaurants were still mired in a sichuan bog he backed gabriela s , an authentic mexican restaurant on amsterdam avenue and 93d street , when other mexican restaurants on the upper west side still specialized in margaritas and chips and , in perhaps his greatest display of foresight , he opened branches of ollie s and carmine s , and another restaurant , virgil s real bbq , near times square just before the redevelopment of times square took off in all , he was a partner or investor in more than a dozen restaurants and food shops , including two docks oyster bar and seafood grills mr cutler did not court critical acclaim with his restaurants he favored hearty easytoenjoy dishes despite his success , he shunned attention he was courteous to reporters , but discouraged questions about his business drew nieporent , whose properties include montrachet , nobu and tribeca grill , said , he was kind of like a quiet genius in our business while mr cutler loved food , his true expertise lay both in devising appealing concepts for restaurants and in selecting sites that might appear improbable artie was a realestate visionary , said michael ronis , who was a partner with mr cutler in carmine s , virgil s and polistina s , a pizzeria and wine bar that is to open soon on broadway near 82d street he recalled visiting times square with mr cutler one blustery saturday night in 1990 nobody was on the street , the wind was blowing and the theaters were closed , mr ronis said but artie said , 'this is going to come back' we might argue about food , but when it came to real estate , we said , 'we 're just riding your coattails' mr cutler saw fertile ground for restaurants on the upper west side , which its residents have long bemoaned as a restaurant wasteland i do n't understand why there are not more restaurants opening here , he said in an interview in 1990 , shortly after opening carmine s this is one of the most densely populated residential ares in the country , with 189 , 000 people per square mile why ca n't others focus on that \? mr cutler seemed to have a knack for developing appealing concepts , and was willing to act as a pioneer tsu yue wang , mr cutler s partner in the four ollie s restaurants as well as in virgil s and carmine s , said only mr cutler was willing to join him people in chinatown were afraid to come uptown , mr wang said artie said , 'why not \? i like it and other people will , too before opening virgil s , he and his three partners toured the barbecue regions of the south in a van we 'd be driving , two italians , a jew and a chinese guy , mr ronis recalled we 'd pull into these huts , and a guy would come to the door , look at us and say , 'are you from the irs \? ' perhaps none of his partners was as unusual as gabriela hernandez , whom he backed in gabriela s she was the cutlers' housekeeper she and her uncle would come to the house and make these wonderful meals , mrs cutler said he said , 'would n't it be great to have a real mexican restaurant , not one of those texmex places \? ' and he opened it in an area he identified as an upandcoming mexican neighborhood arthur cutler was born in brooklyn and grew up in new hyde park , ny the food business came naturally his father had a grocery store and a diner , and his grandfather had a herring stand in brooklyn he comes from a long line of appetizers , said mrs cutler , whom young arthur met in his junior high algebra class they were married 32 years , and in addition to his wife , mr cutler leaves two daughters , jody , 29 , of rockville , md , and danielle , 25 , of coconut creek , fla mr cutler graduated from columbia university in 1965 after trying his hand at business and social work , mr cutler was working in an appetizing store in brighton beach in 1974 when he heard that murray s sturgeon shop on the upper west side was for sale he borrowed the money from my mother , and that s how he got started , mrs cutler said while mr cutler s successes were many , he was not infallible he was a partner in stryker s boxing and sporting club , which failed near times square in 1995 he picked some bad locations , mrs cutler said he had many losses but artie was a gambler he was prepared to take the losses , and he had a lot more winners than losers it was a signature of mr cutler to name his restaurant after a seemingly fictitious personality but , mrs cutler said , the names were not made up carmine s was in fact named after carmine abbatiello , the harness driver , she said ollie s was taken from how some chinese acquaintances pronounced his name , artie and virgil was the starter at his golf club he figured he 'd always get a good starting time , mrs cutler said photo arthur j cutler \( gary cohen total food service , 1996 \)
trenton michael murphy is finally beginning to benefit from the advantage of being the candidate who no one thinks stands a chance a former morris county prosecutor who lives in chatham , mr murphy is one of the three democrats vying for the nomination to challenge governor whitman in november unlike his opponents , he has no political base he has no support from county democratic organizations whose leaders can put party regulars to work on primary day to get voters to the polls in the polls , he trails his opponents , state senator james e mcgreevey , of woodbridge township , and representative robert e andrews , of haddon heights although he exceeded even his own fundraising expectations , he will not be able to spend as much as mr andrews and mr mcgreevey on the most effective , but expensive way to reach voters television advertising yet as he and the two other democratic candidates participated in their first televised debate , mr murphy was served well by his role as the leastlikelytobeelected candidate in the democratic primary during the 90minute debate , mr andrews and mr mcgreevey did not bother to pick on him , choosing to trade barbs only with each other for the most part , all three candidates directed their attacks at governor whitman during the debate that was aired on news12 and other cable television stations around the state they each took turns tearing apart her record and taking similar stands on virtually all of the issues all three opposed governor whitman s new school financing plan and the state takeover of failing school districts none of them approved of her proposal to lower the state s auto insurance rates and they offered some ideas of their own they all liked cutting taxes , but they agreed that governor whitman s 30 percent cut in incometax rates shifted the tax burden onto local governments and mortgages the state s future they even agreed that they would not use taxpayer dollars to try and lure the new york yankees to the meadowlands other than raising the speed limit to 65 mph , from 55 mph , and accepting the full salary of 135 , 000 , if elected governor , there was little disagreement among the candidates both mr andrews and mr murphy supported raising the speed limit and accepting the full salary mr mcgreevey did not with so few issues to set themselves apart , it took 50 minutes into the debate for the two frontrunners , mr andrews and mr mcgreevey , to begin sniping at each other mr andrews took the first shot and mr mcgreevey appeared to be taken by surprise mr andrews challenged mr mcgreevey about his work as a lobbyist almost 10 years ago for a major pharmaceutical company he asked mr mcgreevey about his role lobbying against legislation that would have closed a pipeline in ocean county suspected of discharging polluted water mr mcgreevey chose not to answer the question in the glare of the television cameras , and instead rattled off his record in the legislature , supporting strong environmental standards then , mr mcgreevey fired back at mr andrews , questioning his credentials as a democrat for supporting early republican versions of newt gingrich s welfare legislation that mr mcgreevey said would have abolished the federal school breakfast and lunch programs , as well as federal aid for childcare programs with no assaults directed at him , mr murphy took the opportunity to chastise his fellow candidates for seeking to besmirch each other s reputation i sense there is a little animosity here , he said i hope that we pledge to stay positive and do n't do the republicans' dirty work for them we are all democrats first and candidates second with less than four weeks to go before the june 3 primary election , it will be a difficult promise for mr andrews and mr mcgreevey to keep as they struggle to set themselves apart from each other the three men will face each other in another television debate later this month , and their television advertising campaigns are expected to begin as early as this week state democratic party leaders are hoping that the democratic candidates will maintain a positive tone in these final days , and target governor whitman , not each other democratic leaders , recognizing that any nominee faces an uphill battle against her in the fall , do not want a candidate to emerge too bloodied or battered from the june 3 primary mr murphy may be the only one who could escape unscathed the formidable challenge that mrs whitman presents was evident on the same night that the democratic candidates were engaged in their first debate at the same time , but on a different channel , mrs whitman began her television advertising campaign with a highly effective positive commercial , touting her administration s achievements it aired during the the nanny and newsradio the whitman campaign was counting on television viewers tuning into their favorite shows over a debate with the democratic candidates on cable tv photo jennifer preston
the national association of securities dealers adopted a rule yesterday that will make it much harder for brokers from firms that violate securities laws to move on to other firms after theirs have been shut down at the same time , the association s board voted to change rules that have prevented brokers from suing their employers for discrimination or harassment in the past , regulators have been frustrated by what often happened after they closed a brokerage firm that had repeatedly violated rules aimed at protecting customers the brokers at the firm would move to a new firm , sometimes at the same location under the new rule , if 40 percent of a small firm s brokers are from firms that had either been expelled from the nasd or had their brokerage licenses revoked by the securities and exchange commission , the firm would have to tape all brokers' conversations with customers , and adopt a system to monitor a sample of those conversations to insure that rules were not being broken a large firm would come under the rule if 20 percent of its brokers fell into those categories while the rule will not prevent a firm from hiring a few brokers from others that had closed , it will make it much less likely that a firm would take on a large number of such brokers from 1992 through 1996 , said mary schapiro , the president of nasd regulation , the enforcement arm of the association , 14 firms had their brokerage registrations revoked by the sec for salespractice violations , and 26 more were expelled from the nasd or from stock exchanges for similar reasons brokers who worked at those firms would be covered by the new rule the rule on accusations of rights violations modifies an nasd requirement that all brokers agree to submit disputes with their employers to arbitration , rather than go to court now , assuming that the sec approves , those filing complaints such as sexual harassment or racial discrimination could sue their employers without violating nasd rules it is not clear how much effect the change will have because brokerage houses will still be able to institute arbitration rules on their own , leaving employees with the choice of accepting arbitration or resigning but the new rule may at least cause some firms to not require arbitration , making this a competitive matter among firms the nasd also released a report by frederick m werblow , a retired partner in price waterhouse , who is now an independent consultant and was hired to review the association s compliance with a settlement reached last year with the sec mr werblow found that the association had made substantial progress in several areas , among them enforcement of rules and surveillance of trading the settlement came after the sec and the justice department concluded that market makers in the nasdaq market , which the nasd runs , had colluded to fix stock prices and prevent investors from getting the best deals possible when they traded that led to new trading rules that have narrowed the spreads between the prices paid by investors when they buy and those received when they sell in a related matter , three more brokerage firms montgomery securities , cantor fitzgerald and jefferies company agreed to pay a total of 45 million to settle an investors' antitrust suit relating to the accusations of pricefixing by market makers none admitted liability montgomery has agreed to pay 20 million cantor fitzgerald will pay 147 million , and jefferies will pay 103 million , robert skirnick , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , told dow jones news service three other firms had previously settled , and the suit is pending against 31 others
green bay won the super bowl because a naturally endowed black runner made the difference in a battle of brainpower between two brilliant white coaches and their determined white quarterbacks whether or not you buy this common sports page take , you should buy john hoberman s darwin s athletes how sport has damaged black america and preserved the myth of race \( houghton mifflin \) it s provocative , disturbing , important and particularly relevant after a week that featured desmond howard , o j simpson , dennis rodman and oksana baiul rodman , in particular , is fresh out of hoberman territory white spectators might see dennis rodman as the latest black clown act , he writes but how many africanamericans look past his antics and find themselves engaged in the spectacle of his loneliness and psychic pain \? actually , there are black critics who see rodman in the american class cutup tradition and those who see him as an example of creative resistance to white oppression the rev jesse jackson thinks rodman has been punished enough and should be allowed to rejoin the bulls where , according to hoberman , his decorated body markets black selfhatred hoberman s central thesis , that the black domination of mainstream sports is both a product of racism and a subtle support system for continuing inequality , is not new he appropriately credits the writings and activism of the berkeley sociologist harry edwards , who broke this ground , as well as the recent contributions of gerald early , perhaps the most gifted \( certainly the most readable \) of the younger academics currently harvesting it but hoberman may be the first to carefully expose the turgid history , both in america and europe , of the tabloid science of racial biology as it applies to athletics while he is not without his grace notes \( every night is amateur night at the evolutionary cafe \) , this is serious reading it s also a valuable defense against the pornography of the bell curvers who subscribe to the 19th century law of compensation which postulates an inverse relationship between mind and muscle the athletically superior black is intellectually inferior cornerback , yes coach , no hoberman disposes of the why of black preeminence early in the book the sports fixation is a direct result of the exclusion of blacks from every cognitive elite of the past century and the resulting starvation for 'race heroes' he suggests that the aggressive promotion of black sports heroes has been at the expense of real black heroes he cites the tuskegee negro air corps and the pilots and astronauts who followed racial issues are routinely dodged in sports , unless a nonthreatening , highly commercial superstar emerges michael jordan tiger woods in two months , we will endure the rebeatification of jackie robinson as hoberman points out , robinson is a true american hero , one of the few in sports , but his breaking the major league color barrier 50 years ago has become an unjustified feelgood story , especially without any real analysis of its cost to black institutions why were n't black coaches , owners , and accountants brought up to the majors with him \? the book s heaviest going is also the most rewarding , as hoberman explores the historical complexity of attitudes , black and white , toward racial biology , from the integrationists' fear of where scientific investigations might lead to the racist use of the discredited theories of skin , skull , tendon and glandular differences africanamericans themselves have been accomplices in sentimentalizing black hardiness and physical superiority , based on pseudodarwinian theories of survival through slavery and discrimination hoberman is a professor of germanic languages at the university of texas at austin and brings a fascinating international view the germans had their problems with the black gold they imported from africa for their soccer teams the chinese are currently sending their best soccer players to brazil because they think south americans come closest to their physical proportions and mental attitudes meanwhile , for all the attention kenya and ethiopia have got for their runners , gold medals have not improved the lives of generations of hungry children among the most interesting questions that darwin s athletes pose concerns the role of a black intelligentsia that tends to romanticize black athletes hoberman cites spike lee s exhibitionistic fandom , which the film maker has parlayed into big advertising bucks he quotes professor michael eric dyson on jordan the supreme symbol of black creativity as an example of the dangerous implication that the body , not the mind , is the center of black culture of course , none of this would matter if all black athletes were like grant hill , that product of an athletic huxtable family hill is displayed as the antiworm , which may only prove that these are problems of class as much as race after all , how many white coaches , the brilliant kind who keep all that natural black power in line , will explain that when athletes go wrong it is usually because their poor , dysfunctional families did not prepare them for sudden wealth and fame which brings us to baiul , the week s quintessential ghetto athlete bad attitude , out of control , a drunken driver who only happens to be a short white girl photo
denver , may 22 the lawyers for timothy j mcveigh opened his defense today by raising the possibility that the real oklahoma city bomber had died in the blast that effort began with testimony from oklahoma s medical examiner , who told the jury that he had never found a body to match a severed leg found at the scene and a former chief medical examiner for northern ireland testified that in his opinion , the leg could have belonged to the bomber the defense also took aim at the prosecution s assertion that it was mr mcveigh , using the name robert kling , who had rented the ryder truck that would contain the bomb two defense witnesses testified that they saw a large ryder truck at the kansas motel where , by the prosecution s account , mr mcveigh spent the weekend before the bombing but their sighting of the truck , the witnesses said , occurred on the day before a robert kling rented the one that would be used in the attack in addition , the defense called jeff davis , who delivered chinese food to mr mcveigh s motel room that weekend , on a saturday night four days before the bombing the man who had placed the order for that food called himself mr kling but , mr davis testified today , the man who accepted it and paid for it was not mr mcveigh so went the first day of the defense effort to break as many links as possible in the careful chain of government evidence intended to convince the jury that it was mr mcveigh who bombed the oklahoma city federal building on april 19 , 1995 , killing 168 people stephen jones , mr mcveigh s lead lawyer , began the defense case by calling frederick jordan , oklahoma s medical examiner he asked dr jordan about a severed left leg found in the rubble of the federal building four days after it was imploded by dynamite because further rescues were deemed impossible dna evidence and a print taken from the foot on that leg , dr jordan testified , led investigators from his office and the federal bureau of investigation to a bombing victim who by then had been buried in new orleans that victim , whom dr jordan did not identify in court , was lakesha levy , who was serving in the air force when she was killed , the severing of her left leg among her injuries her body was exhumed , dr jordan testified , and the leg now identified as hers was placed in her coffin a left leg earlier , and wrongly , identified as hers was removed from the coffin and sent to the fbi laboratory for reidentification but because that leg had been embalmed , dr jordan said , investigators were unable to obtain a dna sample , and further identification was impossible we have one left leg that we do not know where it belongs , dr jordan told the jury he also said that although rescue workers had found eight left legs , only seven bodies had been missing their left legs in crossexamination , united states attorney patrick m ryan noted that one woman killed in the explosion had been buried without a leg and that the total number of severed legs , left and right , matched the total number of empty hip sockets among the dead but that woman , subsequent questions by mr jones revealed , was missing her right leg , not her left the defense then called dr t k marshall , former chief medical examiner in northern ireland , who said he had autopsied 200 bombing victims during his tenure in that job dr marshall told the jury that he had studied dr jordan s findings at length and believed that the remaining leg was evidence of a 169th victim who had been blown to bits , the body so thoroughly demolished that no other whole parts of it were ever found this is an extra left leg , he testified until shown otherwise , this must be a 169th victim he went on to say that to be disintegrated so completely , you have to be near the bomb is it possible , mr jones asked , for the body to be completely destroyed \? it certainly is , dr marshall answered he cited one case from northern ireland in which a bomb exploded as a terrorist carried it into a shed eight people were killed , he said , and others were injured as he was conducting the eighth autopsy , he said , his attention was drawn to another finding , a bag containing a little bit of muscle and skin at the end of the autopsy , he said , he looked inside the bag and found a penis as well none of the dead and none of the injured were missing a penis , he said the ninth victim must have been carrying the bomb as it went off , he said , to have been so badly injured on crossexamination , mr ryan told dr marshall of testimony from another witness , michael norfleet , who said he had walked past the ryder truck minutes before the explosion and noticed some people sitting on the front steps , outside the social security office is it possible , mr ryan asked , that one of those people could have been blown to bits , with the leg shielded by one of the planters in front of the building \? yes , dr marshall answered , if the truck were near the front nonetheless , dr marshall told mr jones on redirect examination , with unidentified victims our experience is that somebody misses them when nobody misses them , he added , it reinforces the suggestion that the deceased was involved in the bombing the first witness whose testimony raised the possibility that one ryder truck was being confused with another was herta king , a longtime friend of lea mcgown , owner and manager of the dreamland motel in junction city , kan prosecutors say mr mcveigh checked into room 25 of that motel on friday , april 14 , which was good friday mrs king said that her son , david , was then living at the motel and that she took an easter basket to him there that sunday that was one day before the truck that would carry the bomb was rented by the man who called himself robert kling when she arrived at the motel about 12 45 pm on that easter sunday , she said , she noticed a large ryder truck in the parking lot and another witness , renda truong , a high school student who went to easter dinner with the mcgown family , told the jury that she also noticed a ryder truck in the parking lot that day , and asked mrs mcgown whether someone was moving both mrs king and miss truong testified that they saw no one near the truck on sunday but mrs mcgown has said in interviews that she saw mr mcveigh bring a truck to the motel that day so the testimony elicited by mr jones today may be the start of an effort to establish that mr mcveigh had a truck for some innocent purpose , one day before someone else rented the truck that would carry the bomb the jury has already heard testimony from charles hanger , the oklahoma highway patrolman who arrested mr mcveigh on an interstate highway little more than an hour after the boming , on april 19 mr hanger testified that when mr mcveigh was stopped , he told of having just finished moving some of his belongings to arkansas and said he was headed back to kansas to get more the last witness today was vicki beemer , who handled the paperwork for the ryder truck rental at elliott s body shop in junction city on the afternoon of monday , april 17 she told the jury that two men came in to pick up the truck that day but that she could not remember what either looked like are you able to tell us that mr mcveigh is robert kling \? mr jones asked her no , i ca n't , she answered on crossexamination , scott mendeloff , a member of the prosecution team , asked her , can you say mr mcveigh is not mr kling \? she replied , no , i ca n't photo stephen jones , the lead defense lawyer , at federal court yesterday \( reuters \) \( pg a19 \)
washington , march 17 when the telephone solicitor told maxine wittig of norwalk , calif , that she could borrow money against the equity in her house , she was elated mrs wittig , a 69yearold widow , had lent money to a friend and now needed some of her own the solicitor arranged for a representative from america s trust inc , of san juan capistrano , calif , to visit and explain how she could take out a reverse mortgage , a bank loan that could be repaid by mrs wittig if she ever sold her house or by her estate after her death the deal sounded fine to her , and she signed to borrow 60 , 000 but when the representative asked for the consulting fee of 5 , 571 , she was stunned later , mrs wittig learned that the same service is provided at no cost by the department of housing and urban development for people applying for such loans needless to say , i was shocked , mrs wittig said in an interview she is hardly alone with a growing number of elderly people paying for mortgage services that are offered elsewhere without charge , housing secretary andrew m cuomo today called marketing companies like america s trust scam artists and announced that the department was taking steps to shut them down and to try to get the applicants' money back we are going to put an end to a scam targeting senior citizens , literally charging them thousands of dollars for nothing , mr cuomo said at a news conference referring to the federal housing agency , a branch of the housing department that guarantees the reverse mortgages , he added that the companies will be eliminated from all fha business that s how strongly we feel about it , he said mr cuomo said that the department had so far found a couple hundred people who had used paid consultants to help secure reverse mortgages among 20 , 000 who have applied for them since the program was introduced in 1989 to insure that the number does not rise , he said , a letter was sent today from the department to thousands of lending institutions around the country , notifying them that , effective immediately , the fha will stop insuring any reverse mortgages that are obtained with the assistance of estate planning services mr cuomo also said the department would seek whatever criminal , civil and administrative sanctions against the companies that might be available , as well as refunds for the mortgage buyers jeff butler , owner of america s trust and another service cited by the housing agency , patriot inc , said that the housing department was acting precipitously and unfairly in attacking the service companies mr butler said that all the printed material for his companies told customers that they did not need to use the service to secure a loan he also said that in recent conversations with housing officials in washington , he had offered to help write guidelines for the role that companies like his could play in loan applications but they never got back to me , mr butler said what this is really about is that we 're making money and they do n't like it mr butler said that his companies were involved in helping secure 260 reverse mortgage loans in 35 states but those applications , he said , have been frozen by the housing department s efforts to put the companies out of business he denied that his companies had violated any laws and said that none of the applicants his companies had helped had complained to any better business bureau in california but applicants have begun complaining to the housing department , lenders and the american association of retired persons , mr cuomo said , and that has prompted housing investigators to try to find out how active the services have become mrs wittig , who joined two other elderly people in relating their experiences by conference call at the news conference , berated herself for not reading the material from america s trust , part of which indicated that she would pay the company a percentage , but no more than 10 percent , of her loan request i did n't pay attention , she said it was there , and it was my error for not being more careful she also said she felt betrayed by the company a friend of mine was going to do this i stopped her , mrs wittig said i did n't want her to pay the fees like i did i would n't want my worst enemy to be taken the way i was to me , 5 , 000 is a lot of money
george j marlin , the executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey , announced yesterday that he will leave his post when his term expires in april his resignation was officially portrayed as a natural return to a booming wall street and unofficially depicted as the culmination of clashes with the sprawling agency s board of commissioners commissioners and aides to gov george e pataki said that mr marlin , a former investment banker and conservative party candidate for mayor of new york city , never fully overcame the skepticism among the agency s 12 commissioners that he lacked the management and government experience to run the port authority when governor pataki announced in january 1995 that mr marlin was his choice to run the agency , the governor provoked his first clash with gov christine todd whitman of new jersey , who questioned mr marlin s credentials and let it be known that she felt she should have been consulted officials said that tone never quite changed and that mr marlin s backing on the new york side of the hudson river gradually faded because of his management style , even though they felt he was making inroads in getting the agency to cut its budget and concentrate on transportation issues he needed a bit more finesse , a bit more diplomacy , said a senior aide to governor pataki , speaking on condition of anonymity officials said that mr marlin s replacement would be announced shortly , with five candidates , including close associates of senator alfonse m d'amato , under consideration for the job whoever takes the job will face several thorny issues , including the fight over how much rent new york city should get from its two airports , whether to support the new railroad freight tunnel proposed by mayor rudolph w giuliani and whether the fare on the path system , which is the main public transportation under the hudson , should be raised over the current 1 price lou tomson , the deputy secretary for public authorities , said governor pataki would select a successor from among five people mr tomson said that list included himself h claude shostal , president of the private regional plan association since 1992 and a member of nelson a rockefeller s gubernatorial administration robert e boyle , president of the jacob k javits convention center and a former aide to governor pataki neil d levin , the state superintendent of banks and a former member of senator d'amato s staff , and alfred a dellibovi , the president of the federal home loan bank , who was regional director of the urban mass transit administration in the 1980 s mr tomson said none of the five had been interviewed for the job , and both he and other pataki aides emphasized that mrs whitman would be consulted we clearly have to discuss it with new jersey before the field is narrowed , said zenia mucha , director of communications for governor pataki the port authority of new york and new jersey oversees the metropolitan area s three major airports , the holland and lincoln tunnels , the world trade center and the path by custom , the governor of new york nominates the executive director of the port authority , a job that pays 170 , 000 a year , while the governor of new jersey nominates the chairman of the board , an unpaid position but both governors have to agree on the appointees to the authority , an agency with 9 , 000 employees and a 26 billion annual budget mr marlin , while acknowledging that he had been criticized both for carrying out cutbacks and for the traditional new york perception that the agency favors new jersey , denied that rancor led to his leaving george marlin is leaving because we put together and carried out the agenda and in my judgment it is time to move back to the private sector , mr marlin said , adding that he was weighing several offers and denying reports that he plans to run for state comptroller aides to governor pataki said that mr marlin had said privately that he was tired of the constant criticism leveled at the agency , but he denied that that was a reason for his leaving mr marlin said he believed his accomplishments included cutting 1 , 300 jobs at the agency , preventing an increase in the path fare as well as bridge and tunnel tolls by cutting the budget and selling the vista hotel he said that the 4 billion , fiveyear building program planned under his tenure included major projects like the rebuilding of the international arrivals hall at kennedy international airport and a light rail link there we got back the focus to the core mission of this organization , which is transportation , transportation , transportation , mr marlin said board commissioners said that in the process , mr marlin got caught between the governors of the states , who wanted fast budget savings , and those who felt the cutbacks should have been made with more care senior officials who departed over the last two years included anthony e shorris , the former first deputy executive director charles j maikish , the director of the world trade center william h goldstein , the executive director for capital programs , and gerald fitzgerald , the director of aviation the hundreds of employees who took early retirement or were laid off were without precedent in the agency s 75year history you had a brain drain there that i think would cripple any organization , said one commissioner , who spoke on condition of anonymity , adding that some commissioners were upset that the cuts were not made in tandem with the planning for future investments you ca n't eliminate people like that or have people like that leave and have a stable organization mr pataki was believed to have made the appointment as a sign of appreciation to the conservative party , whose candidate mr marlin had been in the 1993 mayoral election mr marlin called mr giuliani a fraud , during the campaign aides to governor pataki said the mayor had not asked that mr marlin be replaced , but mr giuliani has repeatedly lashed out at the authority
were julius and ethel rosenberg spies for the soviet union \? should they have been executed \? yes and no and no is the nonstartling answer of the rosenberg file case closed many americans , apart from the doctrinaire left and right , have believed for decades that the evidence against julius was compelling , the evidence against ethel was flimsy , and the death penalty was abhorrent tomorrow night s recapitulation centers on the new testimony of alexander feklisov , a retired kgb colonel who says he was julius rosenberg s handler in new york city between 1943 and 1946 mr feklisov , now 83 , recalls the fond feelings that developed between handler and handlee in the years when mr rosenberg was a central figure in a group of engineers who were supplying what they hoped was useful information to moscow he is credited here with passing along , in an automat , a fully assembled proximity fuse , which mr feklisov says the soviets used to shoot down an american u2 spy plane in 1960 mr feklisov maintains , however , that mr rosenberg contributed nothing to the building of a soviet atom bomb , despite the assertion to the contrary of judge irving kaufman , who sentenced the rosenbergs to die and he declares , with passion , that mrs rosenberg played no part in the operation she was just a housewife the program notes that julius rosenberg s role in a spy ring was confirmed by the venona project , soviet dispatches of the 1940 s that were unscrambled by cia code breakers and released in 1995 but morton sobell , who was arrested along with the rosenbergs and spent 18 years in prison , is seen still denying any guilt viewers who come to the subject fresh may find the rosenberg file harder to follow than a le carre spy story , as it delivers the names and faces of conspirators in machinegun fashion steady attention is required to keep track of who was doing what with whom like mr feklisov , the documentary treats the rosenbergs gently , even while granting mr rosenberg s guilt it emphasizes the idealism of those who viewed the soviet union as a champion in the fight against fascism and the ills of capitalism the rosenbergs' political opinions are described as progressive , long a favorite term on the left for allegiance to kremlin policies those who condemned the rosenbergs are criticized those who proclaimed julius rosenberg s innocence and turned the case into an antiamerican cause are barely mentioned both mr feklisov and the program attribute the execution of the rosenbergs in 1953 to anticommunist hysteria the narrator calls the pair lasting symbols of postwar america s political repression but students of the case also note during this hour that julius rosenberg could have saved himself and his wife if he had told the truth that , however , would have meant betraying his comrades , harming the soviet union and undermining the world campaign that had grown around him the rosenberg file case closed discovery channel , tomorrow night at 10 ed wierzbowski , executive producer jan legnitto , producer rob kuhns , editor svetlana chervonnaya and jay ottaway , associate producers robert wesley branch , associate producer nancy lebrun , executive producer will lyman , narrator
when a group made up of the investment bankers goldman , sachs company , the real estate developer tishman speyer properties and david rockefeller took control of rockefeller center last year , they acquired 14 billion worth of real estate , an iceskating rink , a celebrated christmas tree site and one of the most famous stages in the world , radio city music hall what they did not get was what has been on that stage for 65 years the rockettes , the precision dance team whose dozens of svelte , highkicking legs have been as much a part of the music hall s architecture as the gilded arches that frame its proscenium the rockettes , along with radio city s highly profitable christmas extravaganza and its somewhat less profitable easter show , are owned by a separate company , radio city productions inc , which is locked in something of a standoff with the new owners of rockefeller center for control of the music hall s future if they do not come to terms , it is possible that this year s christmas show at radio city will be the last by 1998 , the rockettes could be strutting across a competing stage somewhere else , a radio city in exile radio city productions pays its landlord roughly 5 million a year for a lease on the music hall , which the new owners feel barely reflects the potential of the 5 , 901seat hall , new york s largest proscenium auditorium and while the new owners of rockefeller center will not speak publicly about radio city productions , they have not been shy in telling people in the entertainment industry that they feel the company has operated the hall as a tired museum , filling it up at christmas and letting it go dark for much of the rest of the year radio city is the keystone of everything we 're doing at rockefeller center , said jerry speyer , who as president and chief executive of the partnership that now controls the center has repeatedly stated his interest in restoring the landmark property to its former prestige neither mr speyer nor other owners of rockefeller center would discuss details of plans for radio city , nor would the management of radio city productions speak on the record about the hall s future each side , at least in public , talks only in the most diplomatic terms about the other but interviews with people in the entertainment and real estate industries provided the following picture of an unusual struggle that balances entertainment , history , landmarks and real estate economics radio city productions is clearly eager to remain in charge of the music hall but the new owners have been talking to several of the biggest names in entertainment , including time warner , the disney company and mca universal , hoping to find someone else to take over the hall none of these companies has seemed eager to sign on as manager , however , in part because the hall , for all its fame and architectural glory , needs an estimated 30 million to 50 million for restoration and bringing its mechanical systems into the computer age a lease flawed by missing assets but the reluctance also stems from the fact that a lease on the space would come without the assets for which the hall is most famous a radio city operated by time warner or disney , however successful its programming might be , would be a radio city without the rockettes or the rights to produce anything that could be called the radio city christmas spectacular and last year s 193 christmas performances , seen by roughly a million people , produced 44 million in revenue and , according to people close to the company , 12 million to 14 million in profit would it matter \? at this point , no one is certain whether the auditorium called radio city music hall needs the show that bears its name more than the show needs the auditorium is radio city music hall the rockettes , or are the rockettes radio city music hall \? as if to prove that its attractions can exist apart from their real estate , as well as to demonstrate its ability to do more than stage familiar events in the same place , last year radio city productions mounted road versions of its christmas show in branson , mo , and myrtle beach , sc the efforts were so successful , the company says , that it plans to add a radio city christmas show at the fox theater in detroit and maybe one on the west coast to provide rockettes for these shows , the company is staging auditions around the country this month , expecting to nearly double the roster of rockettes , to 140 sharing the vision of the landlords the company has also been quietly lobbying to convince its new landlords that it agrees with the goal of increasing the income from the music hall and the diversity of its programming , and that it is the company best equipped to do it indeed , like a politician who runs against his own record , radio city productions has tried to distance itself from its own prior management in january the company replaced its chief executive , james a mcmanus , with arlen kantarian , a former marketing executive from the national football league who has run radio city s marketing and entertainment divisions for several years

los alamos by joseph kanon 403 pages broadway books 2995 it takes a dead body to start up the complex machinery of joseph kanon s ultimately compelling first novel , los alamos , about a criminal investigation that unfolds in the days just before the testing of the first atomic bomb on a morning in early april 1945 , a man with his head bashed in and his pants pulled down below his knees is found in the bushes of a park in santa fe , nm yet once the novel s machinery does get going , it gains a powerful momentum , pulling the reader into a historical drama of excitement and high moral seriousness at the end , mr kanon , a former publishing executive , even dares to describe the day of trinity , the explosion of the test bomb he succeeds impressively shortly after the discovery of the body , michael connolly , an intelligence agent with the office of war information , arrives in los alamos from washington and reports to gen leslie groves , commander of the manhattan project groves assigns connolly to find the killer of the man in the park , who turns out to be one karl bruner , a jewish refugee from germany who was working as a security officer at los alamos sensing an ambivalence in groves , connolly asks , are you trying to catch this guy or not \? groves responds , do you have any idea how important this is , what we 're doing here \? he continues right now you 've got thousands of boys dying every week you 've got curt lemay running those b29 s over japan like the wrath of god we have no idea how many casualties none and the invasion will mean more and more we can stop that if we finish the work here so no , i do n't care if they catch one killer we can catch millions unless it is n't just a robbery unless it s about the project that s what we 've got to know since the circumstances of bruner s death closely resemble those of a recent murder in albuquerque , the local police are convinced that they have a homosexual killing on their hands they even arrest a suspect who confesses to both crimes but connolly is n't so sure he suspects blackmail or possibly something connected to a security breach he sleuths around , getting to know the life up on the hill , as the project site is called he interviews robert oppenheimer and some of the other scientists , and attends their musicales and dances he meets and is attracted to one emma pawlowski , the english wife of still another scientist working on the gadget , as everyone refers to the bomb when he interviews the suspect that the local police have arrested , he finds the man completely unfamiliar with the circumstances of bruner s murder mr kanon , who has clearly immersed himself in his subject s history , takes his leisurely time developing his complex story , mostly to positive effect he devotes a moving scene to the news of roosevelt s death he explores in sensitive detail the morality of the building of the bomb , how some of the scientists dealt with their sense of guilt , how others rationalized both its construction and its eventual use tickling the tail of the sleeping dragon , one scientist calls his experiments in measuring the bomb s potential radiation testing how far we can go and the novel vividly evokes the project s landscape the rio grande was swollen and brown , muddy with spring runoff , and connolly could see in its long valley the cottonwood groves and new green fields that had drawn the first settlers in from the desert he had never been to the west before , and the sheer size of it overwhelmed him but it was exhilarating , not lonely you expanded to its scale his mind had been cluttered with a hundred questions , but the sight of the country emptied it there was no brooding in this clearheaded sky only now and then does the novel succumb to amateurishness , to excessively murky plotting and to the author s tendency to overdetermine the motivations of certain characters some actions seem contrived , as when connolly , ruminating in a classroom , takes up a piece of chalk and almost without thinking , begins to diagram on a blackboard everything he knew about the logistics of the case , an algebraic formula disguised as a child s map , just as someone involved in the crime happens to wander by yet despite such slips , the power of los alamos builds effectively and its payoff is the best kind of surprise , one that makes you slap your forehead and exclaim , but of course ! and then comes connolly s experience of trinity suddenly there was a pinprick , whiter than magnesium , a photographer s bulb , and he was blinded with light it flashed through his body , filling all the space around them , so that even the air disappeared just the light he closed his eyes for a second , but it was there anyway , this amazing light , as if it did n't need sight to exist its center spread outward , eating air , turning everything into light this is how it must have been for those who witnessed the event and who can say that mr kanon s story , with its clever mix of real and fictional characters , did n't also actually happen \? or that the events he has imagined do n't forebode the grim future revealed by that terrifying light photo joseph kanon \( marion ettinger broadway books \)
as a building boom supplants farms and open space on the east end , a new coalition of environmental , business and civic groups is promoting a 2 percent realestate transfer tax to preserve open lands influential realestate and builders' groups strongly oppose the proposal , complaining that it would unfairly penalize buyers the new coalition whose leaders include environmentalists , individual farmers , some builders and realestate and bank officials said the tax was urgently needed to enhance preservation programs that they contend are falling short officials in east hampton are moving to submit the tax to a vote in november the tax , which would apply to transactions of more than 250 , 000 for house sales and 100 , 000 for unimproved land , would finance measures like buying land and development rights the proposal would mean that a buyer paying 500 , 000 for a house would pay a transfer tax of 5 , 000 a buyer of a 1 million house would pay 15 , 000 the money would go to a fund in that town the tax , which would not apply to sales less than the thresholds , would be tailored to exempt transactions where land remains in agriculture supporters said the tax would be modeled after a similar tax on nantucket that they said had been successful in preserving that resort island the proponents said the tax would wrest benefit from a tide of development that threatens to rob the area of character , environmental and esthetic assets and rural ways of life the premise is that you capture the realestatemarket activity in each of the east end towns , so that if there is a hot market there will be more money available for preservation , said kevin mcdonald , vice president of the group for the south fork , an environmental group in bridgehampton mr mcdonald said the coalition estimated that it would cost 375 million to preserve significant areas of farms and open spaces that make up 35 percent of the total land area in the five towns in addition to east hampton , the towns include riverhead , southampton , southold and shelter island imposing the tax would require state permission and approval by a majority of local residents in townbytown referendums last week , in a major advance for the tax , the east hampton town board requested state permission for a referendum supervisor catherine h lester said she expected broad support from voters who had backed other preservation programs onethird of the land in the town is protected , mrs lester said , adding , right now , with the building boom on the east end , it s more critical than ever to take steps to maintain our character money from the transfer tax would protect our open space , drinking water , harbors , bays and farmlands , she added state senator kenneth p lavalle , republican of port jefferson , said he was introducing a bill in albany that would authorize the referendum in east hampton a companion bill is to be introduced in the assembly with backing from fred w thiele jr , republican of sag harbor , and thomas p dinapoli , democrat of thomaston mr lavalle said if east hampton approved the tax that could be a model for other east end towns , none of which have requested permission for a referendum we chose east hampton because we had the greatest support there from government , realestate and development people , mr lavalle said the other towns need to go through a longer gestation period but east hampton seemed poised to go ahead the long island builders institute , the long island board of realtors and their statewide parent organizations have pledged to fight the bills officials of the groups said that the tax could spread to other parts of the state and country and that it might finance programs other than preservation the executive director of the long island builders institute , robert a wieboldt , said the tax was an admission fee charged to new buyers , at no cost to landowners or residents it s so easy to pass something like this , mr wieboldt said you are taxing people that are n't there yet mr wieboldt said programs that transferred development rights from areas to be preserved to areas that would be developed more intensively had proved successful in preserving 45 , 000 acres in montgomery county , md , where he recently took coalition members on a tour he said transferring development rights , already in use on the east end , was a way to preserve space without taxes or public spending mr mcdonald , who went to montgomery county , said it was disingenuous to suggest that the transfer of rights was a solution we are headed for suburbia with a few spots of open space in between , he said and the people who are opposed to measures like the transfer tax know that , and they are content to let it happen in southampton , where development has been the most rapid , supervisor vincent j cannuscio , a republican , said he would decide soon whether to support the tax i will probably come down on the side of supporting it , but with certain limitations , said mr cannuscio , adding that they included a time limit on the tax or provisions that it would be suspended if the market cooled
while general manager bob watson waited for george steinbrenner to approve a three or fouryear contract proposal the yankees plan to make to the arbitrationeligible bernie williams , he also fielded 20 phone calls yesterday about cecil fielder s continuing demand to be traded unfortunately for fielder , all the calls were from reporters the unhappy fielder is touring japan with a sneaker company and told reporters in tokyo that he would swiftly trade places with hideki irabu , the japanese pitcher whose rights belong to the san diego padres but who says he wants to play for the yankees i love california , fielder was quoted as saying i 'd raise my hand to go fielder s plea made watson chuckle i guess that s just cecil talking , watson said i talked to san diego once and they said they were not interested at all they have a first baseman making 5 million a year i think it s probably wishful thinking on cecil s part even though the san diego president , larry lucchino , said irabu s rights are assignable and that he can be traded if he is not signed by the padres , it is extremely unlikely that fielder will play with the padres , who are adamant about signing irabu besides , there is no designated hitter in the national league , and the padres already have the capable wally joyner at first base as a veteran who was traded during the regular season , from the detroit tigers to the yankees , fielder invoked a rarely used contractual right to request a deal from new york fielder , who is scheduled to make 72 million in 1997 , can become a free agent after march 15 if he is not traded to another team but watson , who plans to talk to fielder about his crankiness in spring training , said he has conducted two sweeps of all 27 teams without getting a nibble i'm not saying there s no chance we 'll be able trade him , but i would be surprised if cecil fielder is not a yankee on march 16 , watson said watson is trying to insure that williams will remain a yankee beyond the 1998 season , after which he can become a free agent the switchhitting center fielder , coming off his most impressive season in the major leagues , is seeking 535 million to the yankees' offer of 5 million in an arbitration hearing that is scheduled for feb 19 but scott boras , williams s agent , has asked for a twoyear deal for about 13 million let s put it this way , i will not make him a twoyear offer , watson said his number in the second year is off the chart that just does n't make sense for us i would hope we 'll be able to work something out on a three or fouryear deal i will be respectful , but it 'll be at our numbers inside pitch not surprisingly , david wells is one of several yankees who will not attend the threeday fan festival at the new york coliseum this weekend howard frank , wells s lawyer , said the 33yearold lefthander has not yet decided when he will talk with reporters about the street fight he was involved in earlier this month in san diego and the ensuing criminal investigation , which was dropped on tuesday mariano rivera , wade boggs , cecil fielder , charlie hayes , tino martinez , mariano duncan and kenny rogers are among the other players not scheduled to appear at the festival

there are only six governmentapproved drugs for children with hiv , compared with 11 for adults jediyna has tried most of the six i 've run out of options , said dr andrew wiznia , who heads the pediatric aids unit at bronx lebanon hospital center , where jediyna is treated it s very frustrating that frustration extends far beyond the bronx eighteen months ago , when a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors brought unprecedented improvements in treatment for people with hiv , a fresh sense of optimism swept over patients and doctors for many , the new drugs , when used in combination with older antiviral medications , seemed to transform aids from a terminal illness into a chronic , treatable disease yet experts agree that children are not receiving nearly the same benefit as adults infected kids are getting left behind , said dr ross mckinney , a pediatric aids expert at duke university medical center in north carolina we are looking at these wonderful results that adults are reporting , and none of us are perceiving that we are getting the same results in kids there are an estimated 3 , 200 children under 13 living with aids in the united states , and thousands more are infected with the virus that causes the disease , according to the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta but these youngsters account for just 1 percent of the nation s aids cases , and as a result they have long been an afterthought in the epidemic azt , the first antiretroviral medication for aids , was approved by the food and drug administration in 1987 for adults it was three years before the drug was available for children with the advent of protease inhibitors , a glaring spotlight has been thrown on what doctors , aids advocates and parents of hivinfected children have long known was a disparity in care the problem goes beyond a simple lack of approved medications some adults have trouble with the combination therapy , and the same is true of children for some , the drugs do not work at all , and for others they stop working after a time and although doctors are free to prescribe any adultapproved medication for children , many are reluctant to do so with protease inhibitors because less is known about the way children respond to them most infants denied latest aids drugs in the united states , 9 of 10 children infected with hiv acquire the virus from their mothers at birth , as did jediyna \( pronounced juhdinuh \) yet newborns have been left out of the aids drug revolution almost entirely while some are receiving protease inhibitors in experiments , the drugs are not approved for children under 2 this , experts say , is particularly tragic , in that scientists now know that the drug cocktails work best when given as soon as possible after infection this is the only population where we know exactly when they get exposed we can define within weeks when they get infected , said dr arthur ammann , president of the american foundation for aids research of all the patients , they should be benefiting the most socioeconomics also plays a role most children with hiv are poor many , like jediyna , are cared for by mothers who are themselves ill some of these women are barely able to follow their own complicated protease inhibitor regimens , let alone those of their children the mother of one young patient at bronx lebanon gave her daughter the medication religiously for a month , only to find out that the girl had been hiding the pills under the radiator jediyna roche , who has two uninfected older brothers , is being reared by her mother on a budget of welfare checks and food stamps medicaid pays for the family s health care ms nieves says her own health waxes and wanes with that of her daughter when jediyna was admitted to the hospital in august with a bacterial infection , ms nieves began running a fever i get so stressed , the mother said i love her so much at the same time , she confesses that she sometimes skips her own medication , even though she knows that doing so is making her sicker when jediyna is particularly recalcitrant , ms nieves sometimes throws her hands up in frustration
michael donnelly spent 15 years in the united states air force flying fighter jets and traveling throughout the world during that time , mr donnelly , who lives in south windsor , flew 44 combat missions in the persian gulf war and rose to the rank of major but his flying days ended when he retired from the air force last year , disabled by a degenerative nerve disease that some doctors say is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or lou gehrig s disease the tall , slim former pilot , who used to soar across the sky , moves across the floor with the aid of a walker and when he travels now , he uses a wheelchair mr donnelly , who is 37 years old , is one of the tens of thousands of veterans suffering from chronic health problems they believe are related to their service in the gulf war he said he feels betrayed by the air force , which failed to show him the same loyalty he showed his country the air force identified mr donnelly s condition as lou gehrig s disease but denied any connection between the disease and his service in the persian gulf furthermore , mr donnelly was eligible for disability benefits , because his illness struck while he was still in service but the air force considered him eligible for retirement pay based on only partial disability , despite the fact that lou gehrig s disease is totally disabling and ultimately fatal refusing to accept that decision , mr donnelly hired a lawyer and presented his case before the air force medical evaluation board , which finally gave him pay based on full disability this is contradictory to everything the air force taught me as an officer , mr donnelly said we were taught to take care of our personnel , to have integrity , to stand up for what s right and be accountable for our decisions it ought to go both ways on dec 27 , mr donnelly sat in the living room at the home of his parents , thomas and rae donnelly at his side were his father and brother , tim , who had traveled from his home in portland , ore a christmas tree filled one corner of the room photographs of michael and his wife , susan , and their children , 9yearold erin and 5yearold sean , sat on a shelf near the fireplace toys were scattered about my muscles do n't work , michael donnelly said , as he attempted to describe the way his disease has progressively weakened his legs he started to say more , but the words never came out he broke down and cried he reached for his brother s hand and buried his face in his father s arms it s okay , mike , thomas donnelly said as he held his son it s okay we 'll fight this one of the hardest things for the donnelly family to accept is that little is known about lou gehrig s disease , and there is no cure they have spent hours on the telephone seeking information about the disease and have flown thousands of miles , at their own expense , to see doctors who thought they might be able to help michael donnelly the only doctors who have offered assistance are civilians we 've been frantically trying to figure out what to do , thomas donnelly said rae donnelly said she thinks there is someone somewhere who knows what caused her son s illness and could help why does n't the government do the research into the diseases the men have and do something about it \? she asked why do we have to fight the government \? that makes you lose faith a former marine helicopter pilot , thomas donnelly said he grew up believing in the military now , he s angry what s going on is tragic , he said i feel bad for our nation why would anybody serve voluntarily in the face of this \? tim donnelly completed four years of active duty in the marine corps , including service in the persian gulf he said the failure of the air force to acknowledge a connection between his brother s gulf war service and his illness prompted him to leave the marine reserves i'm not going to expose myself to that risk with no one to support me , he said approximately 700 , 000 men and women served in what the defense department called operation desert storm and operation desert shield in the persian gulf an unknown number of those veterans suffer from chronic illnesses with effects like fatigue , joint pain , memory loss , headaches , rashes , numbness , respiratory problems and nervous system disorders these symptoms , as a group , are referred to as gulf war syndrome some veterans say they believe their illnesses are the result of exposure to chemical or biological weapons others suspect they were affected by other things , including pesticides , smoke from burning oil wells and experimental drugs they took to protect themselves from nerve gas scientific information so far fails to connect the veterans' ailments to specific environmental factors in the gulf war , said the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans' illnesses in its final report dated jan 7 the panel said stress is likely to be an important contributing factor and recommended further studies representative christopher shays , republican of stamford , said he was disappointed that the committee failed to call for an independent panel to conduct studies mr shays is chairman of the house human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee , which held hearings about possible exposure to chemical weapons during the war

the largest tobacco companies are selling billions of dollars of cigarettes each year to traders and dealers who funnel them into black markets in many countries , say law enforcement officials and participants in the trade in the last decade , the volume of cigarette smuggling around the world has nearly tripled , according to a leading tobacco research organization this reflects a general surge in cigarette sales abroad , especially for american brands and industry officials acknowledge that a sizable share the researchers say onefourth of the cigarettes sold overseas pass through smuggling rings set up to evade foreign taxes and sell major brands at a discount the companies say they do nothing to encourage the smuggling and do not condone it but recent criminal investigations in several countries show that people in the tobacco industry have played a significant role at times in stimulating and fueling it in one case , two sales managers for the brown williamson tobacco corporation have pleaded guilty to aiding smugglers but what law enforcement agents say is far more common is for the companies to sell huge quantities of top brands to traders and dealers who are little more than pipelines to the smugglers for instance , newly released court documents show that the r j reynolds tobacco company , the secondlargest american cigarette maker , sponsored trips to a luxury canadian fishing resort for several dealers who have since been charged with conspiring to smuggle cigarettes into canada on one fishing trip in 1995 , a reynolds salesman even joked with the dealers about the smuggling and some of the dealers admit that they pour huge volumes of cigarettes right into the smuggling networks one of europe s biggest cigarette traders , michael hanggi , said in an interview that he had been buying winstons from reynolds for 15 years and had resold many of them to smugglers in spain mr hanggi said his threeperson trading company in switzerland had handled 100 million in sales last year of course i know where the cigarettes are going , he said but is that my problem \? other inquiries show that two organized crime groups in italy take in 500 million a year by smuggling in marlboros they buy from swiss dealers selling products made by the philip morris companies , america s largest cigarette maker and later this year , hong kong prosecutors plan to place a former marketing manager for the britishamerican tobacco corporation , a subsidiary of bat industries and a british affiliate of brown williamson , on trial on charges that he took more than 3 million in bribes from dealers involved in smuggling cigarettes into china spokesmen for the three cigarette companies said they did not knowingly sell to dealers who supplied smugglers they declined to discuss any of the criminal cases but they said that while a few salesmen might have been too aggressive , their executives had done nothing wrong and that the companies should not be held accountable for what happened once they sold their products the smuggling costs foreign governments an estimated 16 billion a year in lost revenue but more important , health experts say it threatens to undermine initiatives in many nations to discourage smoking , particularly among teenagers that is because young people tend to smoke more when they can buy cigarettes cheaply , and smuggled brands often sell for about a third less than ones on which taxes and customs duties have been paid the sheer scope of the smuggling also could force changes in the 3685 billion settlement being negotiated with the american tobacco industry the proposed agreement says that before the government could order the companies to lower the nicotine in cigarettes , it would have to guarantee that smugglers would not bring in more potent substitutes but given how easily smuggling can take place , president clinton said last month that this provision was unreasonable and should be changed the recent surge in blackmarket sales has many causes , from the relaxation of customs inspections in europe to the opening of vast new markets in russia and eastern europe market tracking international ltd , a research firm in london that provides data to tobacco industry publications , estimates that 280 billion of the 1 trillion cigarettes exported each year by all producing nations pass through the hands of smugglers , up from 100 billion in 1989 the rise in smuggling also has coincided with a huge push by the american companies to expand overseas , which they see as a way to offset a decline in sales at home american cigarettes are regarded as top quality and are seen as chic in many countries but as popular as american and other western brands are , the companies also run into various sales barriers , including high taxes , limits on imports and countries where cigarette distribution is corrupt the smugglers , though , have increasingly maneuvered around such limits to be sure , in cities from naples to bogota , colombia , the image of street peddlers hawking contraband cigarettes has been an enduring one
abu dhabi , united arab emirates , july 17 there are plenty of good reasons why everything should be running smoothly in the partnership between the united states and the united arab emirates this tiny nation on the persian gulf badly needs protection from its militarily powerful neighbors , iran and iraq , and is negotiating to buy more than 6 billion of weapons from american military contractors the pentagon depends on the emirates' deep ports to make possible its muscleflexing in the persian gulf but despite the personal intervention of president clinton , ties between the emirates and the united states have frayed , western diplomats and other officials say indeed , although the emirates signed a defense cooperation agreement with washington in 1994 , the two sides have yet to agree on how to carry it out the main problem , aggravated by a fatal car accident last year involving an american sailor , is a running dispute about who should have legal jurisdiction over american military personnel serving , or on leave in the emirates the issue is so sensitive that some diplomats , military officials and others say they now believe that when the emirates makes the bigmoney decisions that will turn oil to swords , it may yet turn to other than american military contractors the uae has a position on its sovereignty , and the united states has a position on jurisdiction , and it s delicate , a western military official said , speaking on condition of anonymity among the contracts at stake is potentially one of the largest military aircraft deals of the decade , a 6 billion package for which british and french manufacturers are also competing the deal is considered important enough that clinton administration officials from the president on down have lobbied on behalf of the remaining american competitor , the lockheed martin corporation and its f16 fighter plane twice in the last 18 months , mr clinton has telephoned sheik zayed bin sultan alnahayan , the ruler of abu dhabi and president of the emirates , to push the deal as well as other military projects that have bids from american companies for months , american officials have said publicly and privately that there should be no linkage between the jurisdiction dispute and the emirates' decision on the jet fighter but the mood here is so sour that western diplomats , along with people sympathetic to the emirates , say it is probably good for lockheed that the emirates has apparently put off a decision on the fighter project until later this year right now , it would be awfully difficult for the emirates to announce that it was going to hand over all that money to uncle sam , a western diplomat said ties between the partners turned particularly tense after an april 1996 collision involving a united states navy sailor in which a child was killed and several local people were injured , western diplomats and defense officials said after the accident , the pentagon and the navy dispatched senior officials here , but to their consternation , the sailor was jailed , tried and convicted he was returned to american custody only after the navy paid more than 80 , 000 to the affected family that incident kind of roiled the waters , a diplomat said in interviews , however , some diplomats sought to emphasize the extent of cooperation that continues between the emirates and the united states about 20 american vessels each month make port calls in dubai , jebel ali or other ports , while a small air force unit based in this country provides air refueling to the american planes that fly out of saudi arabia and other countries to patrol the skies of southern iraq a western diplomat also suggested that the two nations had all but resolved their differences over the jurisdiction issue but two western officials said there remained much to work out , and none of those who contended that progress had been made would share details of it all made clear that the issue remained highly sensitive the emirates has signaled that it wants to buy 60 to 80 aircraft and is also considering france s rafale , a successor to the mirage to be manufactured by dessault aviation it is considering , too , a joint britishgerman fighter in which british aerospace has played a leading role but as long as the dispute remains unresolved , some western diplomats and analysts here said it will cast a shadow over both the decision on the fighter jet and on a range of other acquisitions the emirates plans that point has been made by a top emirates negotiator in discussions with his american counterpart , two people with knowledge of the talks said it is clear that the discussions between the united states and the uae on the defense agreement cannot be separated from the discussions of procurement , another diplomat said american officials have argued that the right of the united states to maintain jurisdiction over its military personnel was part of the agreement reached in 1994 but since the fall of 1995 , after the rape of a schoolgirl by american servicemen in okinawa received wide attention , officials of the emirates have demanded that the issue be reopened analysts on both sides suggested that as long as elements of the military cooperation agreement remained unresolved , neither side would be ready to move toward a plan calling for large supplies of american arms to be positioned in the emirates the pentagon has been considering this country as a potential site for such stockpiles since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , and it has moved more than two armored brigades worth of tanks , armored vehicles and other equipment to warehouses in kuwait and qatar but because doing the same in the emirates would require putting more american military personnel on the ground , both countries are bound to be wary until they agree on how to handle future incidents involving servicemen only about 300 united states sailors , soldiers , airmen and marines are now stationed in the emirates , where they supervise port facilities and the small air force refueling operation but tens of thousands more are granted shore leave each year and the port of jebel ali is treasured by the navy as the only one in the region where an aircraft carrier can dock nearly all the servicemen and women who have caused trouble here in the past have been turned over to the navy for punishment still , the pentagon has been determined to avoid similar situations the estimated 240 ships expected to make port calls in the emirates this year is a reduction from a peak of 300 in 1995 the navy has also imposed tough new restrictions on sailors' movements and activities here everyone who leaves a ship understands that we cannot have another incident out there , a western military official said photo map showing the location of abu dhabi , united arab emirates us officials in abu dhabi seek to repair ties in the mideast oil region with

half watching , half dozing , half remembering and threequarters forgetting , summer after summer we can laze away evenings in the company of great old sleuths like holmes and poirot , newer ones from the old country like dalgleish and tennison and new york s own uptotheminute simone and sipowicz it does n't much matter that we 've already seen most of the episodes , some more than once , on a network , pbs or cable whether it s the negligible or unfathomable plots or a case of deteriorating memory , who can recall from one season to the next who did it \? sure , we 've definitely been here before , in this english country house or that lower east side dump , but the ambiance draws us back consider nypd blue , nightly reruns of reruns of which began yesterday on the fx channel , even while summer repeats continue on abc delivered in a lingo that seems to have sprung from the pavement , the smartly edited series catches the city s jagged pace and beatup face it s a weekly tourist guide , an equalopportunity view of crime and punishment , cushioned with reassurance that we are guarded by a cadre of honest , standup , successful lawkeepers against whom the nasties have mighty little chance is there any other literary form that has taken so naturally to television , that manages to draw in so wide a range of viewers , from the masterpiece theater set to fans of primetime crime stuff \? in search of explanation or expiation , i returned the other day to three essays , beginning with why do people read detective stories \? , that edmund wilson wrote in the 1940 s the title was a red herring wilson did n't have a clue to why everybody loves a mystery he was out to trash the entire genre , with swipes at personages from william butler yeats to t s eliot who had succumbed to it with very few exceptions edgar allan poe , arthur conan doyle and , grudgingly , raymond chandler he convicted the most popular practitioners of hamhanded writing among those who appealed the decision were such prominent literary advocates as jacques barzun , joseph wood krutch and bernard de voto wilson had the better of the argument when he charged that the claim of detectivestory readers for the quality of the writing is simply an excuse for their vice , like the reasons that the alcoholic can always produce for a drink any critic who announces after reading one novel by agatha christie that he hopes never to read another of her books is a guide you can trust \( not that he had anything kinder to say about other favorites of the time like rex stout , dashiell hammett , ngaio marsh and margery allingham \) yet in the tradition of the chief inspector clearing the prime suspect , i rise in defense of christie creations like m poirot and miss marple as being classy performers amid the television hodgepodge even wilson , who was not unappreciative of popular diversions , might have tolerated the detectives on the screen better than the ones on the page , who were competing with real novels in the throes of his prosecution , wilson tore apart an offering from the perennially popular dorothy l sayers , the nine tailors provoked by the assurance of several fans that this was sayers at the top of her form , he declared it one of the dullest books i have ever encountered in any field yet in its television version a couple of decades ago \( under the very loose rubric of masterpiece theater \) , the nine tailors made for an engaging show does that signify a direct relationship between how ill a story is written and how well it translates to television \? not exactly the adventures of sherlock holmes , a winner both on page and on screen , forbids any such deduction but the evidence , in plain view , is that the novelist s prose does n't count for much on the tube we are held not by mere adaptations , but by reinventions of the originals wilson noted accurately that the detective story field is mostly on a subliterary level but whether the stories are as adroitly written as conan doyle s \( or , say , ellis peters s tales of brother cadfael , a k a derek jacobi \) or as mediocre as those of most other perpetrators is incidental for television s purposes , the narrative is blithely discarded liberties are often taken with the plots \( which range from pretty clever to pretty pedestrian \) while the characterizations of the detectives and the evocation of their time and place work a spell a peter wimsey who mocks himself what made the nine tailors fun on screen though , granted , no masterpiece was its droll glimpses of a fashionable britain between the wars and ian carmichael s performance as lord peter wimsey , an aristosleuth , whom wilson described as a dreadful stock english nobleman of the casual and debonair kind and whose name he found embarrassing mr carmichael turned sayers s nuisance into a most congenial gent , smiling at the conventions and affectations of his set to add to the entertainment , sayers s explanations of the art of campanology \( which wilson found himself skipping \) were transformed , through the good offices of camera and microphone , into resounding bellringing
irving , tex tiger woods swung his driver and his golf ball soared up , up and away on this 533yard seventh hole at the tpc at las colinas , it would roll to a stop about 330 yards away in the fairway , but while the ball was still a white dot high in the sky , a young man in the gallery yelled , i did that in my dreams last night so did i , somebody else said , smiling , and tiger woods laughed but that somebody else was not just another envious duffer in the gallery that somebody else was nick price , who has won the pga championship twice and the british open once he was out there playing with woods during the first two rounds of the gte byron nelson classic , but with his friendly wisecrack , he , too , seemed to be in tiger s gallery in golf these days , tiger s gallery is the place to be yesterday , woods was serenaded by applause from an estimated 80 , 000 people while shooting a threeunderpar 67 , giving him a twostroke lead at 15underpar 195 in today s final round , as many as 100 , 000 people might be waiting for him to appear on the first tee scalpers , never before seen at a golf tournament here , were asking 100 for yesterday s ticket maybe more today unlike in other sports , golf spectators can see woods up close and personal you do n't need a box seat behind the dugout or a celebrity seat at courtside your golf ticket wo n't get you inside the ropedoff fairways , but every so often woods is right there near the ropes , where you might even hear him talking to his golf ball do n't get behind the tree , he could be heard saying after a hooked tee shot in the opening round do n't it did n't all golfers talk to their golf balls , but when woods talks to his , it seems to obey and sometimes he talks to himself , as he did on the sixth hole yesterday after a spinless flop shot from a grassy greenside swale created a bogey i absolutely , he was heard grumbling , ca n't hit that shot his gallery talks to him too young or old , the fans can be heard shouting , let s go , tiger and every so often he acknowledges those voices , as he did while walking from the 15th green to the 16th tee friday when a little boy stared up at him hi , tiger woods , the boy said woods smiled too many touring pros stare straight ahead too often , as if they were robots , but much of the masters champion s charm is that he is human after a birdie or a good shot , he 'll flash that boyish smile on the way to the next tee , he 'll slap a hand or two extended to him from behind the ropes after a bogey or a bad shot , he 'll flash annoyance with a snap of his head or muttering after a par , he 'll well , after he putted out for his third straight par on friday s back nine , he walked over to the ropes behind the green and handed his golf ball to a small boy maybe he 'll have better luck with it , woods would say later with a smile it was n't working for me through the years , golf icons such as bobby jones , ben hogan , arnold palmer and jack nicklaus have had huge galleries , but none of them ever attracted as many kids as tiger woods does as a kid of 21 himself , he s aware of his popularity , especially with the kids there s a new influx of people who have n't even considered playing the game , especially kids , he said i think kids now see golf as maybe a sport that might be kind of cool to play , rather than just one of those wimpy sports like we all said growing up in his gallery , those kids are n't just teenagers playing golf many are little kids but his popularity demands security in addition to the marshals in irving , four uniformed police officers and several in plain clothes are never far from woods before , during and after his round i wish the crowds would understand and be more respectful where i did n't need the security , he said tournaments are trying to feel out how many people we need going from the clubhouse to the putting green , we had way too many marshals and police officers and security i think it drew more attention than it did to deter it it s upsetting if the fans mob me , like they did in phoenix and los angeles those are situations that potentially become very dangerous a little kid got trampled at the players championship people kept walking over him until i moved them and got him up that s what can happen if we do n't have the security but as he walked not far from the ropes , a little girl , maybe 4 years old , was heard to say , i saw tiger woods all around her , grownups smiled and laughed but that little girl was talking for everyone in tiger woods s gallery photo amid a throng of admirers , tiger woods played his tee shot on the 18th hole yesterday in irving , tex \( associated press \)
deep personal financial debt led the mayor of mahwah , nj , david j dwork , to commit suicide in his township office on the night of aug 18 , his widow , johanna , said at a weekend memorial service mrs dwork said even she did not know the extent of the debt until she went through personal papers after her husband was found slumped on his desk with a single 38caliber bullet wound in his forehead mr dwork , 58 , had left no note there was no escape for him , she said , reading from a prepared statement to a rapt audience of 500 people in the auditorium of mahwah high school on sunday he was too proud to ask for help the couple had been married for 37 years mrs dwork , who declined to be interviewed yesterday , gave no details of the amount or the nature of the personal debts in her statement to mourners michael beatrice , the township attorney and the family lawyer , characterized it as consumer debt mrs dwork nevertheless provided a crucial clue to the mystery that had swirled about the bergen county town of 23 , 000 in mahwah , mr dwork had been a cheerful , personable and constant public presence without a hint of depression or stress since being first elected as a councilman in 1988 for most of us , this was the last piece to a very sad puzzle , said merrie omsberg , a mahwah councilwoman and friend of mr dwork , as she commented on the revelation of financial problems this has brought some closure and some peace for some of us who had unanswered questions but for some of mr dwork s closest friends , the explanation left another question why did n't he ask them for help \? one of those close friends , h murray blueglass , the superintendent of mahwah schools , asked himself this question yesterday as he described mr dwork as an easygoing person who never seemed defeated , stressed out or even driven about anything other than bringing a fulltime passion to his job as the township s 7 , 000ayear , parttime mayor in 1992 , mr dwork sold a liquor store he had owned for 30 years in west new york , nj , and retired to what many thought was relative , if unostentatious , comfort in a condominium he and his wife owned but in retrospect , mr blueglass said , mr dwork was a person who always seemed most comfortable inquiring about the wellbeing of others than discussing his own feelings and life the superintendent said he talked with the mayor on the afternoon of aug 18 about routine business and about the vacation mr blueglass had just taken it was routine and the kind of conversation we had had hundreds of times before , with one exception , i was to learn , he said i later found out that he had contacted six of us that same afternoon who were his closest friends he never really said goodbye i guess he was reaching out , but none of us knew that mrs dwork told the gathering that her husband s suicide was misguided but nevertheless his attempt to spare his family financial embarrassment she did not disclose whether there were insurance policies or other provisions that would ease the debt problems because of his death mr beatrice said that that appeared to have been mr dwork s intent , but that it was not yet clear whether his death would have any effect on the debt by committing suicide , he gave to me what was his last and greatest gift of love , mrs dwork said at the service david did what he thought was the right thing to do
my first worry when i was offered a chance to plunge myself into the freezing surf on new year s day was that i have never looked good in a bathing suit that is not an obstacle , henry dorsey , past president of the atlantic city polar bear club , assured me we have a lot of portly people doing it a couple of women will be showing their tattoos your figure is not a factor what about dropping dead of heart failure or hypothermia \? in seven years , none of us have had any illnesses whatsoever because of this , said mr dorsey , 43 since i started this , i do n't get colds in 1989 , mr dorseystarted the annual new year s day dip when he bet a colleague at the faa tech center in pomona , gene peters , that neither would have the guts to just do it the water temperature was 28 degrees , mr dorsey said air temperature was 15 degrees with 18mileanhour winds , with snow on the beach it was too cold to stand around thinking about it we went right in , and we felt things we 'd never felt before it was he paused a mouthwash for the brain word spread until he founded this latest , and largest , atlantic city chapter of the polar bear club the 70 members' annual ocean plunge raises about 1 , 000 for charities through sponsorships and sales of the club s i survived tshirts and caps the offer of a free hot shower by the health spa at merv griffin s resorts encouraged me to shed my ski jacket , sweatshirt , sweat pants , socks and sneakers and join the beachside throng of swimsuitandgoosebumpclad polar bears in applauding the arrival of mr dorsey , who marched onto the atlantic city beach at 11 25 am on new year s day wearing shorts , tshirt and a santa claus cap according to a large thermometer he had brought , the air temperature was 32 degrees the water temperature was a balmy 38 there s almost no wind , he exulted michael kahlenberg , a shoe store owner who is the local polar bears' current president , handed me a plastic cup of champagne his skin was glowing cherry red in the cold when you 're in retail , mr kahlenberg confided , this is nothing mr dorsey gave a short welcoming speech , advising newcomers to scream when they hit the water no problem , i replied timidly , eyeing the pale gray surf the bears shouted a countdown , and we ran toward the sea for a moment i wondered what would happen if i stepped on a clam shell i stopped caring when the first splash of chilled water hit my toes the running , screaming mob of mostly 40something men \( there were about 10 women \) around me had cut off all avenues of escape a fiery tingle spread along my legs , hips and waistline then , to my surprise , i could n't feel a thing it was as if the nerves in my skin had shut down i saw a wave coming toward me , closed my eyes , ducked and felt it pass over my head i surfaced and realized i had forgotten to scream i was gripped with a giddy fearlessness i came up from under a second wave and saw the bears heading back to the beach most of them had spent less than 30 seconds in the ocean i lingered , waded toward the shallows and felt a gust of wind , and that s when i felt cold i was about to leave when i was almost trampled by a wall of bellowing , ruddy , redskinned polar bears coming in for a second plunge my skin began to tingle again as i staggered out i wrapped myself in a terry cloth bathrobe , shoved my reddened feet into my sneakers and became suddenly , unnaturally warm mr dorsey handed me a frozen orange pop hits the spot , he said mr kahlenberg gave me an i survived certificate i asked if he kept in touch with his fellow bears most of these people i see once a year , he said we say hello , go in , and then go back to our homes and watch football games and do n't see each other until next year among the crowd of dripping , hooting , hollering bears frantically putting on as much clothing as their numbed limbs would permit was a scowling 10yearold kevin storjohann he had accompanied his father , warren , a veteran bear , into the surf for the first time he did not approve of this aspect of adult life and would never , ever do this again i licked my popsicle stick and told him , some things you get used to photo members of the atlantic city polar bear club emerging from the 38degree water into the 32degree air last week on their annual swim \( laura pedrick for the new york times \)
hundreds of camera flash bulbs lighted up yankee stadium when hideki irabu uncorked his first pitch last night curious fans were treating this game in july like october , and the newest yankee like an immediate celebrity and the fans who did not bring cameras were eager for pretty pictures from the japanese pitcher they wanted fullcolor action shots irabu could not have provided much snazzier pictures if he had posed he used a powerful fastball , a nasty splitfinger fastball and a sneaky curveball to register strikeouts irabu kept numerous fans busy dutifully cataloguing each of his nine strikeouts along the facing of the stadium several of the placards used the japanese word for strikeout , providing a touch of tokyo in the south bronx these new versions of the kcorner were only one of the unusual twists on an evening when irabu made yankee history as the team s first japanese pitcher he made it even more memorable by guiding the yankees to a 103 victory over the detroit tigers irabu showed considerable poise , showed why the movement on his pitches can make him overwhelming and also showed that he can sputter slightly if his control vanishes still , on a night when 51 , 901 pairs of eyes were watching george steinbrenner s pet pitcher the man he has obsessed over since february irabu made a valiant debut by pitching strongly into the seventh inning it was appreciated when manager joe torre summoned jeff nelson to replace him , irabu received a standing ovation that did not end until the pitcher was shoved out of the dugout and waved his cap in the boisterous dugout , irabu smiled the experience was more than i dreamed about or imagined for this night , irabu said through an interpreter i would n't sell this night for anything even though the yankees ripped detroit for the eighth straight time , with tino martinez smacking a threerun homer off omar olivares , derek jeter rapping four hits and the tigers giving up three basesloaded walks in an ugly fifth inning , this night belonged to the chunky righthander who longed to play for the yankees irabu allowed two runs , five hits and a surprising four walks in six and twothirds innings and threw 61 strikes among 98 pitches i think the guys rallied around him before the game , catcher joe girardi said you get caught up in the crowd like the crowd does when there s 51 , 000 screaming fans here he brought a lot of life here i'm glad he does that that was a blast an impressed torre said it was remarkable what he did with all the hoopla that was going on we knew it was going to take on a carnivallike atmosphere no one was disappointed steinbrenner added , alluding to the efforts it took to pry irabu from japanese baseball he literally took on a nation to come here he said , 'i want new york' now irabu has new york and new york has him , and the first day of the new marriage was a success there was a circuslike atmosphere as 300 reporters , including 100 from japan , covered an event that was expected to be seen by 35 million people on japanese television but irabu did not wilt , even though his fastball was 5 miles an hour slower than the 99mph cannon he typically throws steinbrenner added to the hysteria before the game by initially limiting access to the clubhouse , and then closing it to the news media altogether , in violation of major league rules the yankees brought some players to an interview room before the game , a switch sanctioned by baseball nothing seemed to bother irabu he barely flinched when four reporters innocently stood beside his locker and a team official shouted , get them away from him , even though none of them spoke japanese and none tried to interview him irabu impressed torre during a pregame meeting when they reviewed signals for pickoffs and pitchouts and he responded to each query in english he did n't have problems , said kota ishijima , irabu s interpreter , who consulted with the pitching coach mel stottlemyre between every inning as he waited in the runway next to the dugout i was in awe irabu received the loudest ovation of any yankee before trotting on the field with his teammates for the national anthem a hulking figure at 6 feet 2 inches and 230 pounds , he quickly looked comfortable in a yankee uniform by striking out four of the first six tigers and tossing 18 strikes in his first 22 pitches when i got out on the mound , all the things that i went through in the last six months came to me in a flashback , irabu said i really had that on my mind i had to change the channel i knew i was part of this team now , and i had to do what i could to contribute but the nifty control that irabu had displayed while giving up only one walk in 31 minor league innings disintegrated when he walked curtis pride to start the third after a single by raul casanova , deivi cruz s hitandrun single on a 32 pitch scored pride to give the tigers the lead , 10 irabu stranded two runners by firing three strikes past travis fryman once the yankees exploited casanova s throwing error for four runs in the third inning , irabu really relaxed he whiffed three of four tigers in an 18pitch fourth eight of his first 12 outs were strikeouts as dominant as irabu was in the fourth , he sputtered in the fifth , when the tigers used two hits and two walks to chisel the deficit to 42 after irabu tossed eight straight balls with two outs to load the bases , stottlemyre asked ishijima the japanese phrase for stay back and made his debut as a bilingual speaker in a comical session on the mound the advice seemed to work bob hamelin cued the next pitch , a tricky sinker , to third base to end the threat the most impressive thing about him was that knack , an admiring david cone said he has that intangible you ca n't quantify when to take a little off the fastball , when to put a little on he had presence he had know how he knows how to pitch inside pitch hideki irabu s first outing compared well with hideo nomo s major league debut for the los angeles dodgers on may 2 , 1995 nomo lasted five innings , in which the righthander gave up one hit and no runs to the san francisco giants while striking out seven and walking four yankee radio and television announcers changed how they pronounced irabu s last name last night , after asking his interpreter , kota ishijima , how the name would be pronounced in japan but ishijima said after the game that the pronunciation that has been in use earrahboo is correct in the united states wade boggs wants to be traded , and his agent is trying to help orchestrate a deal , but the disgruntled third baseman said he would not be a nuisance while he waits like johnnie cochran said , 'if you do n't fit , you got to get rid , ' said boggs , whose rhyming was off a little even though cecil fielder teased irabu about getting to games earlier because he is a rookie , he will not remember the debut fondly as he struck out four times in four atbats and was incessantly booed photos hideki irabu had a few rough spots in his first game as a yankee , but not enough to spoil the evening \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg b7 \) fans in the crowd

the biotechnology industry is poised to deliver a host of cancer drugs in the next two to three years some of them promise to extend lives or at least make treatment more bearable than chemotherapy and radiation more than 30 such drugs are in the third and final phase of clinical trials typically required for food and drug administration approval , more than ever before by the end of the year , oncologists could have in their arsenals a new nontoxic drug for the treatment of nonhodgkin s lymphoma , a cancer of the immune system next year , a therapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma that is as effective as chemotherapy but with none of the side effects could reach the market so could safe and effective drugs for metastatic breast cancer and inoperable brain cancers if the biotechnology companies are as successful as they expect to be , the end of the decade should see many more new therapies for cancers of the breast , prostate , lung , colon , liver , ovary , pancreas and kidney , among others perhaps the biggest gain in the new therapies is that unlike chemotherapy drugs they have few and very mild side effects because they are so well tolerated , the drugs can be prescribed in large doses that are more likely to have an effect , and they can be taken for many years as with new drugs called protease inhibitors that suppress the virus that causes aids , people are not so much talking about a cure though some cancers may be curable but about lengthening lives people will still die with cancer , but they will die less often of cancer unlike chemotherapies , which are chemical based , these new drugs are biological , based on naturally occurring proteins or genetic material and where chemotherapies kill a broad range of fastmultiplying cells , including some necessary for good health , the new drugs are much more specific in their attacks biotechnology industry executives say they are reaping the benefits of a greater understanding of the genetic and molecular pathways of cancer advances in the production of novel therapeutic agents , and a liberalization of regulatory policy at the fda that permits the approval of new drugs for lifethreatening diseases with fewer , smaller and less conclusive clinical trials the fasttrack approval process at the fda has been a particular boon to small biotechnology companies that had felt they could not afford the multihospital , multiyear clinical trials intended to prove that new cancer therapies prolong life to be sure , approving drugs based on fewer clinical trials raises the risk that some drugs of questionable value will reach the market but some cancer patients call that a risk they are willing to take , and oncologists and industry executives say they believe that postapproval trials will weed out those drugs whose potential harm outweighs their benefit the companies acknowledge that many of these treatments will fail nine out of ten experimental drugs do but the sheer numbers hundreds in clinical trials raise the odds that some will succeed like all new biotechnology products , these drugs will be expensive , typically thousands of dollars for an annual supply but if they work they will in many cases cost less than the cocktails of multiple chemotherapy drugs they replace , and will also result in savings from shorter hospital stays , fewer repeat surgeries and increased productivity following the example of the aids community , some cancer patients are becoming treatment advocates they are seeking , and getting , seats on the advisory panels that review cancer drugs for the fda they are pressing for approval of drugs whose benefit might seem small to someone who has not had the disease , and they are demanding access to these drugs even before fda approval the biotechnology industry began investing in cancer research from its inception 21 years ago , but met initially with just mixed results early biotechnology drugs like alpha interferon and interleukin2 are effective against some cancers , but only in doses as toxic as the most potent chemotherapy drugs the problem is that chemotherapy drugs , interferons and interleukins kill not only cancer cells but also cells essential to life reducing dosage to tolerable levels limits their effectiveness , so cancers return by contrast , the new biotherapies draw on the growing knowledge of the process of cancer to focus on specific molecules or genes known to play a role in the specific disease while the bristolmyers squibb company has essentially owned the chemotherapy market for 20 years , the biotherapy market is wide open among the drugs likely to reach the market soonest is rituximab , codeveloped by genentech inc , the pioneering biotechnology company in south san francisco that is now controlled by roche holding of switzerland , and idec pharmaceuticals inc , which is based in san diego in clinical trials against nonhodgkin s lymphoma , a cancer of the immune system , the drug showed tumor shrinkage of at least 50 percent in about half the patients most importantly , it worked in patients with the slowgrowth form of the disease , which resists chemotherapy and its emphasis on fastgrowth cells about twothirds of the 240 , 000 americans who have nonhodgkin s lymphoma have the slowgrowth form and side effects of the drug were minimal mostly mild to moderate flulike symptoms
mayor rudolph w giuliani has been under fire lately for using taxpayer dollars to put his likeness before the public in television and radio commercials , and yesterday , acknowledging the problem , he vowed not to do it anymore in the weeks between the september primary and the november general elections except that there will be just one more it turns out that even as he was making his announcement , his own sanitation department began running a halfmilliondollar television commercial featuring a new spokesman for the virtues of recycling the mayor of the city of new york yes , that s mr giuliani on the screen pitching an empty water bottle into a recycling bin under the guidance of joe torre , the manager of the new york yankees and mr giuliani , who ridiculed the city s recycling goals as absurd last year and vowed to defy the city s recycling law , seems to be bothered by none of the various paradoxes inherent in his commercial appearance it s going to be on before the primary is over , said the mayor yesterday , clearly annoyed to be defending himself on the subject yet again the fact is , it s an area in which i have received a certain level of criticism which i thought was unfair and it was filmed two or three weeks ago and it fits perfectly within the rules whether it fits perfectly within the rules is an issue that will be decided shortly by the city s campaign finance board it is mulling over a complaint filed on monday by the leading candidate for the democratic mayoral nomination , ruth w messinger , concerning a similar radio commercial , in which the mayor promotes the new metrocard transfer that advertisement cost the public 200 , 000 combined with a 300 , 000 series of commercials earlier this year in which the mayor urged people to shop during a week in which the sales tax on clothing was dropped , the city has now spent more than 1 million in public money this year on commercials that broadcast mr giuliani s face or his voice to the public most of that money has been spent in the second half of the year , as the november election draws closer the recycling ad , which began appearing on monday and will continue through sept 7 , cost 140 , 000 to produce and 400 , 000 to place on most of the city s television stations the commercial shows mr torre giving pitching instructions to an unidentified figure , who heaves the bottle in a perfect strike into the bin then the camera pulls back to show that the pitcher is a smiling mr giuliani , who discusses his future as a reliever with the manager and muses that he could be at yankee stadium in no time if he just took the no 4 train from city hall \( the mayor uses another form of public transportation to the stadium a policechauffeured gmc suburban \) it ends this way the mayor and the manager both know where it goes reduce , reuse , recycle it all comes back to you other recycling commercials began running last year , with the dance theater of harlem , jerry orbach of law and order and oscar the grouch lucian chalfen , the sanitation department s assistant commissioner for public affairs , said the advertisements were part of the department s budget for outreach and education , timed to coincide with the introduction of mixedpaper recycling to brooklyn and queens in late september the department spent four months trying to persuade the mayor to appear in a commercial , and he assented a few weeks ago we always get hammered by the advocates on pushing recycling , so we thought , what better way to promote a program of recycling than to get someone who people will remember \? mr chalfen said and someone said , what about the mayor \? many of those advocates remember the mayor as a critic of the very law that set up the department s recycling budget in july of 1996 , faced with a lawsuit that accused him of violating the city s recycling law , mr giuliani denounced the goals in the law as absurd and irresponsible and praised an article in the new york times magazine that challenged the practicality of recycling and called it a waste of time and money gene russianoff , a senior lawyer with the new york public interest research group , said he saw no reason why the city had to spend recycling dollars on commercials showing a mayor who was running for reelection when other celebrities could have a similar effect to use public funds to shmear his face on tv in september is wrong and potentially crippling to the campaign finance program , he said the whole idea of the program was to eliminate some of the advantages of being an incumbent mr giuliani had argued exactly the same point four years ago when he was the challenger and mayor david n dinkins was appearing in advertisements selling city bonds but mr giuliani lost that point before the campaign finance board , and has since taken a new stance we litigated this and the rules were set and we 're following them , he said yesterday and we will continue to follow them and when we get to the period where we get into the general election , then we will not have any of these ads on television , even though we properly could probably do it but i decided that rather than stretch the point , we will stop at that point the sanitation ads are different , he said , because they had been shot before he adopted his new position photo in the new ad , a new pitcher , left , and his coach , yankees' joe torre \( new york city department of sanitation \) \( pg b2 \)
hong kong , feb 7 morning at hong kong s most irreverent , and popular , radio talk show begins with the rhythm of kettle drums and the gurgle of tea dribbling into a china cup good morning , good morning , barks a voice that seems hauled along a gravel road it s 8 13 , let s get the show going what s up \? and so albert cheng , the man behind the voice , revs up teacup in a tempest this is a window on hong kong , mr cheng said to a visitor , playing with a button on his checked sweatervest and what a window it is , a grand bay on all hong kong , a window through which mr cheng harangues and teases , lectures , annoys and berates the territory s leading political figures , its cultural icons and , perhaps most perilously , the impending sovereign , china the glee with which he goes after his targets raises questions about his prospects under chinese rule among his betes noires , the current favorite is hong kong s leadertobe , tung cheehwa , the shipping tycoon chosen by beijing to run the territory after the british flag is lowered at midnight on june 30 we do n't even know where this guy came from , mr cheng barreled along he is so conservative he s from outer space and out of time where 'd they find him \? people looked to him to speak up for hong kong now people know he s only a mouthpiece for china not known for holding his tongue , mr cheng crouches at his microphone at commercial radio and begins his dialogue with hong kong , a mix of news and pummeling opinion punctuated by the chatter of telephone callers cabbies irate over bridge tolls , homemakers angry at the housing department and , more recently , callers incensed over the creation by china of its own transitional legislature for hong kong , what it calls the provisional legislature it s become the house of all the turncoats and losers , mr cheng said , referring none too subtly to the chinese panel made up in part of prochina members who were trounced in elections in 1995 we talk about the provisional legislature all the time if prochina people call , i'm not polite to them i'm rude to them with many of hong kong s newspapers and television stations reining in their more aggressive coverage of china and toning down their editorials , the impending change of sovereignty here has only spurred mr cheng on whether he can remain on the air after chinese rule returns is uncertain i think every one of us wants to stay in hong kong , he said but we worry about the changeover it s never happened before in history that a capitalist country is handed over to a communist country people worry that hong kong will become like singapore a nice , clean jail indeed , mr tung , the future chief executive , routinely expresses admiration for singapore s authoritarian leader , lee kuan yew , and the antiseptic citystate he created , a state draped in oratory about asian values repeatedly , mr tung champions the theme of asian values which he lists as respect for our family and elders , integrity , honesty and loyalty toward all , commitment to education , belief in order and stability and emphasis on obligations to the community rather than just individual rights a linkage that mr cheng and his fans dismiss hong kong is successful because of individuals , because of individual entrepreneurial spirit , mr cheng said , fending off phone calls and a request to schmooze by the station manager hong kong people are very different from mainland chinese , taiwan chinese , singapore chinese hong kong chinese are very westernized nobody agrees to traditional ways anymore we cannot live in the past mr tung , he said , should stay in china in a redandsilver taxi crawling toward happy valley in central hong kong island , sham lai chuen , the 45yearold driver , admitted to a morning addiction to teacup and mr cheng there are other shows , but i do n't listen to them , mr sham said i like the show a lot and i think cheng is really good because he s honest and willing to speak the truth when he speaks out about something , he can always justify his points with facts and reason , mr sham continued , a good deal faster than the traffic if he ca n't explain what he says , no one would accept or support him but he s always responsible for what he says mr cheng s journey to talkshow stardom as an onair rabblerouser began in the late 1960 s during china s cultural revolution , a decade of death and mayhem instigated by mao zedong i was a fanatic , said mr cheng , who hides his 50 years behind a fast grin and easy slang i was a maoist abroad , in many chinese communities , mao s call to permanent revolution was seen as an exultant expression of a new chinese spirit in fact , virtually no one knew the extent of the horrors being visited on china by mao s radical followers we all went , mr cheng said of his leftist colleagues who visited china we wanted to stay there and contribute to the cultural revolution but they kicked us out they said we could contribute outside china and out he went , to vancouver , british columbia , where he worked as an engineer for 15 years returning to hong kong in the early 1980 s , he began publishing a series of magazines , helped sally aw sian , owner of the sing tao newspaper group , reorganize her publishing empire and then tried television , where his show news tease a bombastic interview show with local guests earned top ratings but invariably , he said , his tongue ran wild and the show was axed people think i'm opinionated , he said , laughing , that i'm a motormouth after toying with the idea of running for hong kong s legislative council , or legco , in 1995 , he was saved from politics by an offer from commercial radio i decided to do this instead , he said i became the 61st member of legco i'm hong kong s unofficial ombudsman and while he listens to people s complaints and hectors government officials over late buses and laggard ambulance services , it is his boisterous forays against china s plans for hong kong that galvanize his listeners and raise doubts about his longevity on the air still , mr cheng is hoping his program will stay on the air after china s fivestarred red flag is hoisted over the territory if this program is banned , you lose a window on hong kong , he said people will lose their freedom of speech photo albert cheng , left , and his cohost , peter lam , take a call on their radio program in hong kong news outlets here have toned down coverage of china and its impending rule , but the issue has only spurred mr cheng on \( john giannini for the new

a singleengine plane crashed in the water between jones beach and point lookout on long island yesterday , killing all three people on board , the authorities said the plane went down in jones inlet , not far from the jetty at the western tip of jones beach , about seven minutes after it took off from republic airport in farmingdale , ny , said james peters , a spokesman for the federal aviation administration officials said the pilot radioed that the plane , apparently bound for lancaster , pa , was in trouble moments after making a routine call for clearance to enter air space controlled by kennedy international airport witnesses said the plane had flown in and out of a patch of low fog just before the crash , but it was not clear whether that had played a role in the crash or whether the plane had had mechanical trouble investigators from the national transportation safety board were trying to determine the cause air traffic controllers at kennedy notified the united states coast guard , which dispatched four rescue vessels a boat from the town of hempstead reached the scene first , and pulled the body of a woman from the water she was pronounced dead at the nassau county medical center in east meadow , ny coast guard divers later found the wreckage of the plane in about 30 feet of water , with the bodies of a man and another woman inside a spokeswoman for the nassau county police , officer adele burke , said that currents were too strong to remove the bodies last night , and that divers would return to the scene this morning none of the victims were immediately identified last night surfers who were in the area when the plane went down said the fog had cut visibility on the water to only about 20 feet paul tripaldi , a surfer from danbury , conn , who was paddling into jones inlet , said the plane was close to the water when it emerged from the fog it looked like it was trying to hit us , he said , but it went back into the fog we did n't think anything more of it a friend who was surfing with him , mike plaia of ridgefield , conn , said he heard a thud , like a slap , like a heavy object hitting the water within minutes , they said , rescuers began arriving map showing location of the crash site a plane was seen flying through a patch of fog before it crashed
as sure as the promise of a spring day , millions of proud parents have been descending lately on the nation s campuses , snapping pictures of their daughters and sons collecting college diplomas parents and students alike have been preparing for this moment for decades , before many parents took out second mortgages and the typical graduate piled up 12 , 300 in debt to help cover bills for tuition , room and board that average 10 , 000 a year now it is time for that steep investment , as much as 130 , 000 in the case of some elite private schools , to return dividends there is plenty of good news for those receiving undergraduate degrees this year , but with just enough caveats to keep some people on edge over all , the job market for the 12 million graduates this year is the strongest in memory , partly because companies , in their aggressive downsizing drives of recent years , may have laid off too many workers of their parents' generation many ivy league graduates and those with degrees in highly marketable areas like business administration and computer science can expect plenty of job offers at high pay and the nation s highestprofile student , chelsea clinton , is unlikely to find herself behind a counter waiting on customers when she graduates from stanford , where she will be a freshman this fall in contrast , those with weak grades and little patience for job searches may struggle to find work , as they always do but just how good is it for the rest of the army that is resolutely marching out of the classrooms and into the real world \? it turns out to be pretty good indeed for a broad swath of the newly minted grads many had the luxury of choosing among several job offers months before commencement exercises began and starting salaries are , for the most part , higher than they were last year but even in such upbeat times , the jobs can be far from glamorous for instance , rachel d gunderson is busy making sure there is enough dirt on the shelves of target stores after graduating from the university of wisconsin , she landed a job ordering potting soil for the chain linda c roman , of the university of florida , has signed on at kraft foods to improve the packaging for cottage cheese and sour cream in fact , many new graduates are fast learning a lesson that their predecessors have had to accept over the decades they have landed at the bottom of the workaday ladder , with plenty of dues to pay before they step up to the next rung and for a growing number of graduates , that ladder is n't even the one that they or their longsuffering parents originally had in mind for them , it is not always clear why an expensive education was needed none of my friends ever told me about the carwashing part , said julie a schenk , 22 , who turned down two other offers to work as a management trainee at enterprise rentacar after graduating in december from the university of dayton ms schenk , whose major was communications management , is n't the only one washing cars 5 , 000 members of the class of 1997 are expected to sign up with enterprise , where cleaning is just one of the duespaying chores others have taken similar training jobs at department store chains , where they wait on customers that can leave some parents horrified that their children do n't have more to show for all the financial sacrifices it is like sticker shock , said kevin j nutter , the career services director at the university of minnesota in minneapolis the problem for people in this group is n't that they wo n't find work , but that they may not find what they think is good work , mr nutter said that is because the number of servicesector jobs has grown as the number of management positions has shrunk , he said at the same time , so many people are now graduating from college that a degree no longer carries the cachet that it did even a generation ago if the experience of recent graduating classes is any guide , many in this year s crop will quickly grow dissatisfied members of the class of 1994 at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign , for example , were asked a year after they graduated whether their college training was being put to good use almost 40 percent considered themselves underemployed , nearly double the percentage of recent years , said david s bechtel , director of the university s career services center but there is little complaining so far from the new graduates i had a lot of friends who were working for enterprise , and they all spoke highly of it , said ms schenk , who said she was not disappointed in her job , despite being surprised by some of her duties others who have crossed over to the working world in recent months are also making do or even flourishing following are four tales from the trenches that offer hope and guidance to those just now trading in their diplomas , caps and gowns for briefcases and business suits rental clerks joining a fraternity with 12hour days few parents who squirrel away money for years to pay college bills picture their children hanging up a hardwon diploma behind a rental car counter , but about 10 , 000 moms and dads will watch it happen this year
in a rare courtroom reversal , a judge in state supreme court in manhattan has rescinded her approval of a plea bargain by a former union business agent accused of extortion and bribery , saying she agreed with dissident union members who had protested his proposed sentence as too lenient the former agent , james mcgorman , was arrested in late 1995 after an investigation uncovered a flood of complaints that he and other officials in new york city s building workers union often demanded bribes of people seeking to land or keep 30 , 000ayear jobs as porters and superintendents , mainly in manhattan office and apartment buildings because of the judge s turnabout , mr mcgorman changed his plea to not guilty on jan 23 facing a sentence of up to seven years if convicted , he is to go on trial march 26 lawyers and criminal justice experts said that judges in the city s courts rarely interfere with plea deals arranged , as in mr mcgorman s case , by the defense and prosecution and none could recall a judge doing what justice rena k uviller did cite public complaints about a sentence as a significant reason for rejecting a plea bargain in the city s courts , it happens once every half century , gerald b lefcourt , the presidentelect of the national association of criminal defense lawyers said of justice uviller s action justice uviller , who will preside at the trial , declined to be interviewed but at a hearing on dec 18 , she warned mr mcgorman that she might reconsider the sentencing terms because she had received numerous letters suggesting that the accusations against him might not be an isolated incident mr mcgorman s lawyer , richard d hott , called the judge s decision outrageous and said it could deprive his client of a fair trial because jurors might learn of the plea deal and assume he had already admitted his guilt i do n't think organized letterwriting campaigns belong in the criminal justice system , mr hott said judges should not base their decisions on what is politically expedient at the time mr hott maintained that mr mcgorman had pleaded guilty in october based on promises by prosecutors and justice uviller that he would be sentenced to community service and a possible fine but not prison time if he admitted the top felony count against him receiving a bribe another felony charge of grand larceny by extortion was dropped daniel j castleman , the chief of the investigation division in the manhattan district attorney s office , said that he could not discuss the prosecution s reasons for consenting to the plea and the original proposed sentence because of the pending trial the main prosecution witness at the trial will be louis gonzalez , 33 , a slender , darkhaired man who began working as a building porter and handyman in his late teens for 15 years , he has been a member of local 32 bj of the service employees international union , the unit representing about 65 , 000 building cleaners , doormen and superintendents in january 1995 , mr gonzalez said in an interview , he sought mr mcgorman s help in getting an apartment superintendent s job at 305 riverside drive a relative of mr mcgorman s , he claimed , told him that mr mcgorman could arrange his hiring , but i would have to pay mcgorman mr gonzalez said he did not consider a single payment to a local 32 business agent to be unusual because many of them solicited bribes he said he feared employment problems and physical retaliation if he complained to union officials or to law enforcement agencies , and acknowledged having given bribes of 150 a pop to other business agents the first day on his new job , mr gonzalez said , mr mcgorman greeted him with his hand out , stating , do i have anything for him over the next six months , he gave mr mcgorman 980 in several payments , he added mr gonzalez said that he wanted to remain on good terms with mr mcgorman because an agent s support was vital in getting higherpaid jobs and in settling disputes with employers but he began hiding from mr mcgorman , he said , because he could not afford to pay what mr mcgorman demanded as a superintendent , his salary was 598 a week and he lived rent free in a basement apartment with his daughter , who was then 9 mr gonzalez said he avoided mr mcgorman for weeks before being jolted awake one morning at 2 o'clock by someone pounding on his apartment door it was mr mcgorman , mr gonzalez said , demanding that he make yet another payoff to keep his job i was very upset , mr gonzalez recalled i could not take the pressure he was putting on me anymore mr gonzalez said he refused the demand , and that day sought out a friend , an agent with the federal drug enforcement administration , who put him in touch with investigators from the united states department of labor and the manhattan district attorney s office wearing a concealed microphone , mr gonzalez recorded nine conversations with mr mcgorman in september and october 1995 , usually in the business agent s burgundy cadillac according to an indictment , mr mcgorman accepted 1 , 000 in bribes and made incriminating statements about earlier payoffs from mr gonzalez after mr mcgorman s arrest in 1995 , mr gonzalez asserted that union officials blackballed him as a rat and undermined a complaint he made after being dismissed from his superintendent s job

rye , ny , april 8 after pounding the helmeted head of an opponent with his fist in an exhibition game , shane churla of the rangers missed the beginning of the regular season with a broken hand when he returned , a punch to his face fractured his orbital bone and put him out again later , churla injured his hand again a strained ligament in a pinkie when he tried to fight but instead grappled with a linesman who restrained him a wrinkle of almost comic relief came when he injured his knee while walking his dog but the worst moment came in a game against the hartford whalers , when coach colin campbell told churla not to fight he did anyway , and his opponent was stu grimson , the grim reaper , who hesitated because he was aware of the fragile condition of churla s cut and fractured face when linesmen and other players did not break it up , grimson began to punch churla s face , opening a flow of blood that horrified even jaded fans and players , who shouted for the officials to end the fight every time i thought it could n't get any worse , it got worse , churla said today after practice i feel like i 've had one arm tied behind my back you feel guilty for a big part of the season , i did n't feel like part of the team i 've been half a man all year it s been a year i would n't wish on my worst enemy well , maybe a few one of them , at least at the moment , is eric lindros of the philadelphia flyers , who smacked churla in the face with his stick on monday night and broke churla s nose lindros got two minor penalties for highsticking on the play , and the rangers turned the two power plays into two goals in a 32 victory churla was one of three rangers whose faces were hit by lindros s stick the rangers asked the national hockey league to review the infractions , and a league spokesman said today that a videotape will be screened by brian burke , the senior vice president , before the two teams play again thursday in philadelphia churla and the rangers want lindros suspended , although such discipline is unlikely but the broken nose , which left churla with a black eye and facial cuts , also brought praise from the rangers' coach campbell was pleased that churla not only checked well and provoked a hottempered outburst from lindros , but also that churla did not retaliate and end up with a penalty or in another fight last friday night in buffalo , during another meanspirited game , churla provoked a sabre to take a penalty and then negated it with a gratuitous crosscheck of his own i was totally upset , campbell said of the buffalo incident it was almost the night of 'i 've had enough' campbell said his ire was calmed by something wayne gretzky said to him then without being specific , campbell said gretzky supported churla and added that both gretzky and mark messier have spent the season trying to encourage churla , a 31yearold veteran of 11 seasons and five teams what shane s got to prove to us is that he can do it again and again , campbell said , referring to churla s turntheothercheek response of monday night fighting achieves nothing other than making you feel good inside for about 10 seconds if you win shane is certainly from the old school in fighting where you 've got to keep proving you 're a man campbell , who takes pride in his ability to communicate with his tough guys , frequently talks with churla , not always in a pleasant tone of voice he has said frequently that churla can be a valuable playoff participant the way he was last spring if he sticks to a hardhitting , checking game churla said he understands that his coach and his teammates have his best interests at heart , but he is tired of hearing the scolding of the coach and feeling the pats on the back from players we 've talked a lot , maybe too much , he said of his dialogues with campbell it was kind of tough for both of us if we could do it differently , we probably would have , both of us as for the teammates , churla said they have been unbelievable , 100 percent supportive , but you get tired of guys tapping you on the back he said he was to the point of tears over his bad luck and you think you broke a mirror or walked under a ladder as someone who earned his hockey spurs with his fists and his big body checks , he finds it difficult to restrain himself from throwing punches you can only bluff so much until players start calling your bluff , he said you 're secondguessing yourself there are times you are told not to fight and times you are told to fight some crossed messages he acknowledged that there s not much fighting in the playoffs , and that there may be times when he has to take a punch in the mouth or watch your teammate get slashed without retaliating born in fernie , british columbia , and schooled in the junior ranks at medicine hat , churla is married with two daughters his offseason home is in big fork , mont , on flathead lake in his nhl career , he has 26 goals , 45 assists and 2 , 301 penalty minutes but none of those minutes came monday night he said the lights kind of went out a couple seconds when lindros felled him churla returned after the nose was repaired he s a big man , he does n't have to bring his stick into the act , churla said of lindros i sort of lost a lot of respect for the guy churla also said he would have been ejected and suspended if he had done the same thing to lindros i lost a lot of respect for the officiating , churla said there s a lot of politics in this game lindros , churla said , is a superstar , and those players get treated with a

before corporate america s recent dash into cyberspace , the last time so many people went so far and spent so much to get so little was perhaps the gold rushes of the 19th century in 1996 , internet lucre proved as elusive as the mother lode at least for the prospectors just as the stampedes to sutter s mill and the yukon yielded far more broken hearts than bonanzas , the quest to make money on the internet has been , for many entrepreneurs , as frustrating as navigating the world wide web and while the digital miners are meeting with spotty success , the real winners are those who sell axes , sluice pans and mules ever optimistic , the companies betting on the internet sales are sure success is just around the corner the people who thought '96 was the gold rush were chasing fool s gold , said kate delhagen , an analyst at forrester research , a market research company in cambridge , mass , which estimated the internet economy at 148 billion in 1996 ninetyseven will be the first real year of action on line , she added analysts , of course , were saying the same thing about 1996 a year ago but at least a few more of the thousands of companies that have opened doors in the electronic shopping mall seem likely to turn the corner this year , if only because the heavy startup costs required to become serious internet merchants will recede farther behind them there are three main ways that companies \( and individuals \) are trying to make money on the internet the first is to develop content so compelling that people will pay to see it , a strategy that has succeeded mostly in the pornography market , but is also being followed by encyclopaedia britannica \( http www eb com \) among others the second , and far easier , path is to sell advertising , generally consisting of little banners at the top of popular web pages that with one click will take the user away to a web site for , say , a taco many observers question the effectiveness of banner ads , and many users complain about finding sales pitches everywhere but a few companies are attracting solid , if not spectacular , revenue from advertising take the starwave corporation a creation of paul allen , the other microsoft billionaire , starwave developed espnet sportszone \( http espnetsportszonecom \) , one of the most popular sites on the world wide web , as well as official sites for the national basketball association and the national football league on an average day , sportszone alone attracts about 400 , 000 people , who make almost 3 million visits to pages within the service , according to michael b slade , starwave s chief executive starwave charges sportszone advertisers 2250 per thousand page visits , and so the company takes in at least 65 , 000 a day in advertising from sportszone alone another 25 percent of company revenue comes from subscriptions from serious fans who are willing to pay for even more services , including sports news , statistics and fantasy leagues but even that is not enough as a private company , starwave is not required to release financial information , but mr slade gave no indication that the enterprise is in the black i would be very surprised if any company in our realm is profitable , he said it s probably reasonable to assume a business like ours , if it doubled , would be looking pretty good and that will probably happen in the next year advertisers seeking heavily used trails have clustered on the sites of the big world wide web search engines excite inc , the infoseek corporation , lycos inc and yahoo inc all sell advertising they all went public last year , though none has yet reported a profitable quarter the third road to internet riches is taking orders on line for reallife products , a 518 million market in 1996 , forrester research estimated when experts talk about online retailers , one of the first names that comes up is virtual vineyards \( http www virtualvin com \) , which is based in palo alto , calif , and has shipped tens of thousands of bottles of internetordered wine since early 1995 venture capitalists have invested about 3 million in the company , said cyndy ainsworth , the company s director of marketing but are they profitable \? not yet how about next year \? optimistically , i hope so one reason that profits remain only virtual is that virtual vineyards had to make huge investments in both hardware and software to get its system up and running , ms ainsworth said tack on a directmail promotional campaign that included offers of free biscotti , and starting an internet business can get pretty expensive , she added preview travel inc \( http www previewtravel com \) , based in san francisco , sold more than 1 million worth of airline tickets on the internet in the first week of december profitability for companies like ours is a late '97 event , said the company s chairman , jim hornphal but jeff p bezos , founder and chief executive of seattlebased amazoncom \( http www amazon com \) , which bills itself as earth s biggest bookstore and is generally regarded as one of the big internet success stories , with sales increasing by more than onethird each month for the last 18 months , put things in a different light we are not profitable , he said we could be it would be the easiest thing in the world to be profitable it would also be the dumbest we are taking what might be profits and reinvesting them in the future of the business it would literally be the stupidest decision any management team could make to make amazoncom profitable right now so who is making money on the digital frontier \? wilderness guides and hired guns data networking companies like cisco systems inc and the 3com corporation are flush , as are a growing number of the designers who put web sites together they reap the investments other companies must make to join the online marketplace i would n't say '97 is the year of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , said starwave s mr slade i 'd say it s the year when things continue to improve as a commercial medium , it is maybe 20 months old he said that would be like cable tv in 1977 , the magazine industry in 1800 , radio at the turn of the century yet the pace of what s happened in 18 months is amazing chart seeking their fortune on the web few companies are making money on the internet , but analysts , as they did last year , are saying profits are just around the corner chart lists three of the most popular business strategies for the web
fort worth as the carswell air force base shrank to the vanishing point , its credit union , set up in 1956 with 35 in assets and seven members , was growing into one of the biggest financial service providers in the dallasfort worth metropolitan area nearly six years ago , the announcement that carswell was going to be shut , a victim of the end of the cold war , stunned the community and sent shock waves through the economy but the announcement did not faze the carswell federal credit union it simply changed its name to omniamerican and kept expanding today , it counts 137 , 100 members employed at 1 , 300 businesses and organizations , ranging from the boy scouts of america to pier one imports at the end of 1996 , assets totaled 5177 million , and omniamerican currently boasts 12 branches , from the original office at what is now the fort worth joint reserve base to a spiffy 3 million office , complete with a baby grand player piano , abutting one of the city s toniest residential neighborhoods at a time of immense turmoil in financial services , credit unions once backwaters of american finance have moved aggressively to supplant commercial banks in many of their traditional businesses they pay more interest on deposits , charge less on loans and provide free many of the services that banks have tacked fees on all in all , america s depressionera experiment with financial socialism is thriving in these bullishly freemarket times and bankers do n't like it one bit for years , they have been fighting , in the courts and in the halls of congress , to turn back the credit unions' invasion of their territory the threat to them is real since 1980 , the cooperatives' membership has surged to 704 million , from 44 million , while assets have exploded to 316 billion from 69 billion \( the conflict reached a new level on monday with the supreme court s announcement that it would review a lower court ruling that placed sharp limits on membership in federally chartered credit unions , which number more than 7 , 000 the court is expected to hear arguments in the fall and render a ruling sometime next year and the issue will be on full display in washington wednesday , when a house subcommittee led by marge roukema , a new jersey republican , is scheduled to hold hearings \) the stakes for both sides and for the american public are high credit unions like omniamerican promote themselves as friends of the consumer , grassroots organizations that offer higher interest on deposits and lower rates on loans than commercial banks but the banks do not see it that way to them , credit unions are exploiting their taxexempt status to grab market share banks view their predicament as a result of the 1982 ruling by the national credit union administration to allow credit unions to accept members from any number of employee groups instead of just one the banks complain that the federal regulatory agency s liberal reinterpretation of the federal credit union act of 1934 in effect gave credit unions carte blanche to sign up just about anyone , thereby transforming themselves into financial octopuses that threaten the banks' livelihoods and the bankers' view has found sympathy in the federal courts thomas p jackson , a court of appeals judge , characterized the credit union agency as a rogue federal agency and accused it of colluding with industry groups to evade a court order restricting credit union membership david l tapp , president and chief executive of overton banchares inc , a 760 million institution with 14 branches in the fort worth area , sees the situation this way i think credit unions have a place in this world but they should either be allowed to have a common bond or be forced to pay taxes and compete with us if credit unions paid taxes and have the same regulatory burden banks do , i 'll compete with them every day of the week not surprisingly , the credit unions play on popular distrust of the banking industry as a profit machine indifferent to the needs of the little guy this movement is about serving people , not stockholders , said dan mica , a former congressman from florida who is now president of the credit union national association , an industry group our motto is people first , profit second omniamerican is one of the biggest and most efficiently managed of the nation s 11 , 900 credit unions , most of which remain what they always were back rooms in small companies where employees deposit 50 a week in their savings account and take out car loans at belowmarket interest rates but banks fear that unless they prevail in court , or congress steps in , sprawling credit unions like omniamerican will become the wave of the future a wave that could swamp the more vulnerable banks on the consumer banking side , they are eating the banks' lunch , said bill strunk , chairman of strunk associates , a financial consulting firm in houston what they have done in this state is establish branch offices all over a city in essence , they are like a consumer bank
the diamond project , a festival of new works that the new york city ballet does not call a festival , continues apace , and the third entry , circle of fifths , is a winner christopher d'amboise , a former principal in the company , who directed the pennsylvania ballet from 1990 to 1994 , has taken philip glass s 1987 concerto for violin and orchestra and choreographed an astringent puredance work full of surprises working in an alltoofamiliar style , descended from george balanchine s ballets to stravinsky s music \( notably symphony in three movements and agon \) , mr d'amboise nonetheless exhibits his own fierce originality the world premiere of circle of fifths on friday night at the new york state theater left many a blazing afterimage there was wendy whelan seemingly covering the diagonal of the entire stage in one jete or being tossed halfway across that stage back to a cluster of men in the rear there was peter boal , in what must be the most restful role since franz in coppelia gets to sleep through the entire second act after he is drugged by dr coppelius during the second movement of the glass concerto , mr boal lies on the floor while ms whelan and albert evans fit the angular lines of their bodies into the astonishingly inventive duet that makes circle of fifths so striking within its selfimposed conventions for essentially mr d'amboise has taken a risk kevin o 'day and angelin preljocaj , the choreographers who preceded him in this third diamond project \( the earlier series ran in 1992 and 1994 \) are not members of the city ballet like the three other choreographers still to come , mr d'amboise has absorbed the balanchine repertory in his bones as a dancer but as a secondgeneration city ballet member , he absorbed the tradition more deeply than most a little prince in the nutcracker , and a son of the city ballet dancers jacques d'amboise and carolyn george , he became a principal dancer in the company that is , he grew up without the need to question the value of ballet s classical idiom or its formal value circle of fifths is a plotless ballet that is about its movement , although the lighting , especially well designed by mark stanley , and the gorgeous metallic blue or green leotard tops by holly hynes , can contribute to an implied dramatic imagery in the choreography the literal beauty of the ballet reveals itself only in the duet , which becomes a trio , and this lies largely in mr d'amboise s play with structure choreographic motifs recur and acquire different meaning in a new context mr boal dives more than once to the floor , and he is not the only one to do so a phrase that ends with two dancers palm to palm looks fresh when it is part of an accelerated sequence the risk is that circle of fifths will look like so many other neobalanchine ballets in the master s contemporary style in those works to 20thcentury music , the academic vocabulary is the reference point but is just as often inverted and so the first movement of circle promises its own share of cliches feet are flexed as well as pointed , legs are held parallel as well as turned out but as the ballet progresses , a simple image of dancers bouncing up and down with legs held parallel takes on a creative edge toward the end , the three principals \( mr boal , ms whelan and mr evans \) and eight ensemble dancers \( cara copeland , michele gifford , pauline golbin , jennifer tinsley , stuart capps , james fayette , benjamin millepied and robert wersinger \) jump up and down in this position but also spread into different floor patterns here is reductive movement that translates mr glass s minimalism with appropriate flair the glass score is atypical , free of the expected chugging modular rhythms of the composer s theatrical works and recognizable as a violin concerto with classical antecedents with richard moredock conducting , guillermo figueroa brought mr glass s long melodic line into vibrant relief with his violin solos , especially in the second movement the first section introduces a standing group mr boal dives to the floor while mr evans and ms whelan begin some dolllike gestures that , frankly , do not promise much structure raises its head , however , when ms whelan does a more centered version of the weightshifting solo with which mr evans opened the ballet mr stanley bathes the stage in blue light , and there is an aquatic fluidity to the ensemble dancing , especially during the jagged fiddling that precedes the second movement here , the ballet shifts to a higher level as ms whelan and mr evans , dancing superbly , are seen in the equivalent of a closeup , a duet in an enlarged spotlight mr evans encloses his partner from behind or claps his hands overhead \( she and mr boal will do the same later \) torsos , wrists and ankles are rotated and there is a striking image when ms whelan bends down and swings her leg around like the hand of an invisible clock mr evans lies under her legs as she points her foot and yet none of this looks artificial when mr boal rises from his rest , he executes the same movements as mr evans at one point , the three principals seem to perform fragments of a composite sequence mr evans runs in a circle as the repeated bowing of the violin solo is heard against the background of the cellos the third section brings back the ensemble with four pairs prancing in emboite there are knockkneed shapes and plies but the ruling image is that of ms whelan in her flying leap across the stage mr d'amboise has magnified her normal energy what a dancer there were three balanchine ballets on the program kyra nichols repeated pavane and margaret tracey and a romantic nilas martins displayed the same line , dancing in harmony in allegro brillante helene alexopoulos , as a showgirl siren , seduced mr boal in prodigal son as the antihero he fused his country bumpkin portrayal with his heroic dancing praise is in order for michael byars and mr wersinger , both making something out of the thankless roles of the son s servants , once called friends
the future of home entertainment is manifestly digital that much understood , a slumping and impatient consumer electronics industry wants to proclaim the future now , the golden age of digital technology dawned but if it has dawned , the sky is barely red with intimation of the high noon to come and as much as the clamorous industry might wish otherwise , that period of maturation cannot be forced for well over a year , consumers have been teased with the twin promises of epochal technologies aborning the digital video disk and the melding of conventional television with the internet not surprisingly , those were the dominant themes at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas , nev , recently yet both of these concepts inspired as much doubt as anticipation doubt on many levels in the case of the socalled convergence of television and the internet , one might well question the appropriateness , the relevance and the very logic of the idea for television and computer manufacturers , who have both experienced stagnant sales of late , the logic is compelling create a new genre of product , and pump fresh life into a comatose market but do consumers need or want 27 or 32inch televisions with internet browsers built in \? does such a product make sense \? it s quite a leap from the popular mode of home theater , with its rich sensory embrace , to the notion of commingling twister with chat rooms on the internet the distance from my eyes to my computer screen is 29 inches , but i watch television from 10 feet away with these apples and oranges , a determined electronics industry would have us make fruit salad although some internet experiences , like playing video games between cities or shopping , might be more fun and more satisfying on a larger screen , much of the internet is based in text do you really want to read a newspaper from across the room \? surely no more than you would prefer to watch twister from 29 inches away none of this even addresses the rudimentary state of the convergence technology offered so far there are no delivery standards the assorted internetready televisions viewed in las vegas were works in progress , and no two of them conveyed data with the same efficiency , completeness or legibility mostly , they looked crude and so , mostly , did demonstrations of the digital video disk although manufacturers of the new players and distributors of video software generally pointed to april as a likely date for the arrival of the digital video disk , cynics questioned whether the highly touted format would ever take off the new medium , which looks like a music compact disk , had already been promised for the third , then the fourth , quarter of 1996 ostensibly , the 1996 unveiling was thwarted by the hollywood studios , which insisted on a rigorous scheme of digital encoding to prevent pirates from using the disks to create masters and flood european markets before films are officially released there that dispute resolved , the industry went to las vegas more or less united in its visions for april the latest bad sign came in a round of demonstrations the samples generally looked better than vhs tape but inferior to laser disks the technology was not the problem one highend video company , faroudja , and a professional engineering firm , snell wilcox , offered spectacular demonstrations but faroudja was using a rigorously designed player meant to sell for 5 , 500 , and snell wilcox was using a digital image processor priced at 27 , 000 only toshiba presented compelling evidence that the picture from a digital video disk could be effectively delivered by a machine priced for the broad market , in a range from 500 to 700 toshiba , which has always been the strongest advocate of the digital video disk , displayed an image unmarked by the smudged color , the fuzzy outlines and the ghosts that beset most other showings of the new disk toshiba s products looked as good as a typical laser disk one could not help wondering whether the critical need to hold down costs of encoding and of hardware design will undercut the potential of the digital video disk by and large , it did not look like a product ready to storm the world video distributors , meanwhile , seemed to be in disarray over pricing of the new disks while warner was sticking by its intent to match the selling price of movies on vhs tape \( 15 to 20 \) , a spokesman for columbia tristar predicted a selling price somewhere between vhs tape and laser disk , or up to 40 inquiring minds cannot but wonder why the studios believe that mainstream consumers , who rejected the superiority of laser disks at 40 , will abandon their vcr s and buy digital video disks in vast quantities at 40 or 30 or even 25 each why , indeed , in a medium that again like laser disk does not permit recording \? and the digital video disk is a long way from being a recordable medium while pioneer was introducing one of the most exciting products at the show , a music cd recorder for 1 , 000 \( half the price of the least expensive previous model \) , the videodisk contingent was answering similiar inquiries with sighs the industry consensus was let s get this thing off the ground and established , then worry about a recordable version in two or three years that perspective may hinge on quite an assumption consumers love their vcr s they can record on them they may not actually do so , but they can if they want to a better picture \? there s a catalogue of 10 , 000 laser disks to satisfy that need in the spring , the industry will mount a major push for the digital video disk it would be a strange paradox if it had to vie for the interest of consumers with the internet television drawing \( michael klein \)

to the editor robert christgau s defense of plagiarism \( letters , june 1 \) is an insult to writers everywhere i am one of the writers whose work was copied into john heidenry s what wild ecstasy , without attribution mr heidenry appropriated , at last count , more than 40 paragrphs from five articles i wrote while he and i were colleagues at forum magazine although he rearranged some of my paragraphs , he changed virtually none of the wording how could mr christgau pronounce mr heidenry s work an excellent book while disparaging as boilerplate prose , the work of the seven writers who were plagiarized \? without reviewing the original articles , mr christgau has no way of knowing which parts of the book are mr heidenry s own and which are the work of others i was astounded by mr christgau s statement that he doubts any of mr heidenry s sources could have written , constructed , or stolen such an excellent book apparently mr christgau not only condones plagiarism , but is even willing to compliment an author for his proficiency at it i suspect mr christgau rushed to judgment because most of the plagiarized articles originally appeared in sexually oriented magazines but the writers of those articles have also been published in the new york times magazine , harper s , esquire , new york , popular science , and other respected publications there is no special dispensation for plariarists who steal xrated material , regardless of whether it is boilerplate or poetry dawn stover white salmon , wash robert christgau replies i have great sympathy for dawn stover , who was done a crass disservice when john heidenry used her research \( and often language \) without attribution but her letter does n't increase my faith in her accuracy or acuity far from disparaging sex magazines , my review singled them out for praise , and my socalled defense of plagiarism was hardly fullbore it merely pointed out that not every western thinker equates it simplistically with piracy , as philip nobile does
washington , aug 27 mike espy , president clinton s first agriculture secretary , was indicted today by a federal grand jury that said he , his brother and his girlfriend had received more than 35 , 000 in favors from large companies with interests before the government mr espy then tried to cover up some of the gifts , the indictment said mr espy , a rising mississippi politician who was appointed to the cabinet after lending crucial support to bill clinton s first presidential campaign , is the highestranking member of the clinton administration to be charged with a crime he was indicted on 39 felony charges that include mail and wire fraud , violations of the meat inspection act of 1907 , taking illegal gratuities , making false statements and tampering with a witness prosecutors say mr espy broke the law by accepting tickets to professional basketball , football and tennis events as well as other gifts the gifts included a waterford crystal bowl , luggage , lavish crosscountry trips , cash payments to his girlfriend and a 10 , 000 contribution to his brother henry s unsuccessful campaign for congress mr espy then failed to report the gifts properly and misled federal investigators and president clinton s chief of staff about them , prosecutors said they said mr espy also asked an agriculture official to alter a document requested by the inspector general about a lobbyist who paid for his and his girlfriend s trip to a national football league playoff game in dallas in 1994 mr espy s girlfriend , patricia dempsey , was named in the indictment but has not been charged ms dempsey is said to be talking to investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution henry espy , also named in the indictment but not charged , was acquitted in march on unrelated charges that he lied to a bank to obtain a loan to help repay a campaign debt for his unsuccessful effort to fill the house seat vacated by his brother in 1993 the indictment portrayed mike espy as an official who regularly accepted big and small favors from executives of companies regulated by his department for instance , he asked the chairman of the quaker oats company for two tickets worth 90 to a championship game in 1993 between the chicago bulls and the phoenix suns on another occasion , the indictment said , mr espy scheduled official events around a weekend in atlanta in january 1994 so he could attend the super bowl at a cost of 2 , 200 to a company with issues under consideration by the agriculture department in another case , he improperly kept a car leased to the department near his home in mississippi to use for personal travel when questions arose about the gifts , the indictment said , mr espy either lied to investigators or quickly made restitution and called the matter an oversight for example , when confronted about his decision to use a corporate jet to fly home after a festive weekend retreat in arkansas in 1993 sponsored by tyson foods , mr espy told investigators that he was directed to return to the white house early for dinner with mr clinton and that no commercial flights were available in fact , the indictment said , mr espy had planned all along to use the corporate jet even though his staff had already made reservations for him with a commercial airline white house officials declined to comment on the indictment , as did mr espy as the investigation was expanding near the end of 1994 , mr espy stepped down as agriculture secretary in december and returned to practice law in jackson , miss , at the firm of crosthwait terney a receptionist at the firm said today that mr espy would not make any statements and referred all calls to his lawyer in washington , reid h weingarten mr weingarten issued a statement denouncing the indictment in general terms without addressing the particulars never has so much been made of so little , mr weingarten said in an effort to justify three years and countless millions spent on this investigation , the special prosecutor has stretched criminal statutes beyond recognition and taken trivial , personal and entirely benign activities and attempted to distort them into criminal acts these efforts will ultimately prove unavailing and we look forward to going to court and restoring mike espy s good name the indictment did not accuse mr espy s agriculture department of granting any favors to the companies or changing any policies as a consequence of the gifts at a news conference this afternoon , the independent counsel in the case , donald c smaltz , said the laws mr espy was charged with breaking did not require such a finding we do not charge a quid pro quo , mr smaltz said we do n't have to under the gratuity statute a quid pro quo is not required he added we 've also charged violations of the meat inspection act of 1907 , which similarly does not require any quid pro quo it simply requires or prohibits the secretary from receiving things of value with businesses that he regulates under the meat inspection act
to the editor from 1979 to 1984 i lived on first avenue between east fifth and east sixth when i moved into the building , none of the storefronts were restaurants they were all businesses that closed by 7 or 8 pm by the time i left , all were serving indian food late into the night imagine coming home every evening to the overwhelmingly permeating smells imagine the noise of the kitchen staff below your apartment until midnight or later imagine the cockroach population when garbage is stored in the basement or yard imagine restaurants cutting doors into your hallways so customers can get to the bathroom or the backyard without going through the kitchen imagine strangers in your building lining up to use the bathroom outside your apartment door i am very fond of indian food i just did n't want it to become my life resident actions to restrict enlargement of the restaurants were not motivated by racism or even regionalism all things considered , the restaurants on and around east sixth were a plus for the neighborhood but how many businesses can survive when they are all the same \? earlybird specials are not going to save them i hope they can learn to diversify mary tepper brooklyn heights
washington , aug 27 in sworn statements released today , the army s top enlisted man offered his most complete response so far to sexual harassment charges , saying each of his six accusers had been encouraged to lie by investigators to support a racist scenario they had concocted in which he , a black man , had lusted after the women because they were white in the statements to investigators , gene c mckinney , the sergeant major of the army , said none of the allegations made by the women were true in testimony over the last two months before a hearing officer who is considering whether to recommend a courtmartial for sergeant major mckinney , the six women recounted how he had made various unwanted sexual advances , taking advantage of his influential position one woman testified that he had betrayed her trust by first befriending her and then having sexual intercourse with her against her will when she was more than seven months pregnant during the proceeding at fort mcnair in washington , sergeant major mckinney , a muchdecorated 29year veteran whose job makes him the representative of the army s 410 , 000 enlisted soldiers , denied the charges through his lawyer , but he did not take the stand but in the statements , which were made part of the record and released today , sergeant major mckinney , the first black man to hold the post of sergeant major of the army , said he had concluded that race was the major reason for his prosecution he said investigators for the criminal investigation division had planted the idea that he was interested in white women when they interviewed people all the female accusers are white although i was slow to believe it , he said , i am now becoming convinced that race and ethnicity are driving the investigation and the way it is being conducted moreover , he said criminal investigators had willfully ignored evidence that the women were unstable or had a motive to lie army prosecutors painted a starkly different picture of sergeant major mckinney s accusers , calling them heroes who risked career advancement and their reputations to come forward and tell their stories the prosecutors emphasized that none of the women had known one another and that they had come forward independently under the army s procedures , the hearing officer , col robert jarvis , is to decide soon whether to recommend a courtmartial to the commanding general in the washington military district there is little doubt among military law experts that colonel jarvis will do so if the commanding general concurs , sergeant major mckinney has no right of appeal the mckinney case is the latest in a series involving sexual harassment charges that have proved deeply embarrassing to the army and that have underlined the military s difficulties in integrating the sexes the case began when a former subordinate of sergeant major mckinney , brenda hoster , said he had tried to grab and fondle her when they were in a hotel in hawaii for a military conference in april 1996 at the time , ms hoster was a sergeant major and served as a public relations assistant ms hoster said that although she had since retired from the army she came forward because she was appalled that sergeant major mckinney had been named to a special panel to reduce sexual harassment in the military
the house lights have just dimmed on the set of win ben stein s money ! the game show s host , the tarttongued actor ben stein , has settled into a soundproof booth while his opponent , a los angeles writer named bob , tries to cough up correct answers to 10 obscure questions the stakes are unusually high unlike other game shows , which pay contestant winnings from sponsors' budgets , win ben stein s money ! takes the booty out of the host s 5 , 000ashow paycheck the setup is a recipe for hostility just ask bob , whom mr stein has publicly dubbed the trivia blob earlier in the game , bob looked unbeatable , easily defeating two other contestants for the right to face mr stein in a final round but now bob , an ace who once racked up 200 , 000 in winnings on jeopardy , is struggling over gameshow staples like which state first ratified the constitution \?

the police last night arrested a queens man after discovering dozens of containers of hazardous materials at his home yesterday afternoon one canister was marked sarin gas , but officials said they did not know if it actually contained the powerful nerve gas used in a terrorist attack in the tokyo subway in 1995 as a precaution , more than 200 people were evacuated from the area around the house at 24105 52d avenue , in the douglaston section officials said the canister would be tested by the department of defense sometime today the police reported that in the house , they had also found more 200 gallons of flammable liquids including gasoline , lacquers , jet fuel , ether and nitromethane based on those findings , the owner of the house , lester e deily , 52 , was arrested at the 111th precinct station house on charges of reckless endangerment , the police said officials said that during questioning he had told the police that the canister did not contain any sarin gas neighbors described mr deily as a lifelong chemistry buff and a loner who lived in the same house where he had been raised by his grandparents at a news conference at the scene early this morning , mayor rudolph w giuliani said mr deily had told investigators that the canister contained only oxygen and that the label on it was a joke but the mayor said officials would take no chances at this point , in order to be safe , we have to treat it as if it is sarin gas , mr giuliani said that s why all these precautions are being taken , because we do n't know whether we can believe this person or we ca n't one law enforcement official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that two other containers in the house were marked radioactive but that tests had revealed no signs of radioactivity mr giuliani said that mr deily had ordered 69 , 000 worth of chemicals and scientific equipment from the hewlettpackard company but had not paid his bill , and that the police were led to mr deily by two hewlettpackard employees who went to his home yesterday afternoon and became suspicious when they saw a number of chemical containers by midafternoon , police , fire department and environmental emergency workers had surrounded the house and had started to search through the dozens of containers , none larger than five gallons the house has been described as an overpacked for those of you who remember the phrase collier s mansion , said chief of department louis r anemone , referring to a famous house that was found crammed with newspapers at about 7 30 pm , the police found a 83liter silver canister in the basement marked with a homemade label that read sarin gas next to it was a canister marked compressed air at that point , mr giuliani said , the search was called off mr giuliani said that mr deily had been convicted of a harassment charge in new jersey five years ago for making threatening telephone calls neighbors said mr deily was a car enthusiast who had been restoring an old mercedes and jaguar investigators said they believed that mr deily was using some of the fuel found at his home in that hobby but officials last night said last night that they were most concerned over the possible presence of sarin , the degenerative nerve gas that killed 12 people and injured thousands when it was released by an apocalyptic cult in the tokyo subway in 1995 police officials said they were not qualified to test the canister for the nerve gas and last night were awaiting a special airtight container from the department of defense officials to transport the canister to a police department firing range in the bronx at 11 15 pm , officials began evacuating residents from about 100 homes in the leafy neighborhood near douglaston parkway deputy inspector

computer inside the threestory house , investigators found tools , chemicals , generators and extension cords , sergeant cory cuneo , a department spokesman , said investigators found the house to be extremely neat , he said late last night , emergency workers were preparing a police robot to conduct a further search of the house by remote control lee anne rothstein , 30 , an unemployed teacher who often walks her dog around the quiet leafy neighborhood , said that mr deily was a recluse who inherited his house from his grandparents and rarely left it he was quiet and kind of eccentric , she said i do n't think he held a job he was constantly throwing out garbage in big black plastic trash bags wrapped in duct tape , she added it would sit in the front of the driveway for weeks another neighbor , hank brehl , 51 , said mr deily had moved to the douglaston with his grandparents at the age of 10 and that he and mr deily had gone to public school 98 , junior high school 67 and bayside

zurich , jan 15 a historian working for the union bank of switzerland ordered the destruction of hundreds of pounds of archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with nazi germany , investigators said today the investigators said the material , which was shredded last week , filled three large packing crates , each roughly three feet square and two feet deep , and two plastic garbage bags four to five feet high the papers destroyed may have accounted for as much as twothirds of the cache , the investigators added the historian kept no inventory of what was destroyed , which will make it difficult to determine whether the bank broke a monthold swiss law that prohibits companies from destroying material that may shed light on switzerland s role as banker to hitler s germany our main problem is knowing exactly what was destroyed , said peter cosandey , zurich s district attorney , who is leading the investigation there were files in there that dated back to the 1870 s , and they are obviously not relevant but there are also documents from the 1930 s and 1940 s , and the time frame is such that they could at least theoretically have been useful the new details surrounding the destruction of documents came as the swiss government sought to mend its strained ties with jewish groups worldwide jeanpascale delamuraz , the minister of economics , apologized today for his comment last month that jewish groups had engaged in blackmail when they demanded that the swiss set up a fund for holocaust survivors mr delamuraz , who was president last month under switzerland s rotating cabinet system , said in a letter to the world jewish congress that he was very sorry and that he had been misinformed about what jewish organizations were requesting the union bank of switzerland flatly denied today that any interesting documents had been destroyed , saying the historian was 100 percent confident that none of the materials are related to the holocaust the company also said that the bank s management had known nothing about the shredding and that the action had nothing to do with the broader controversy over nazi money but bank executives were at a loss to explain how the historian , who has not been publicly identified , could have taken the action , particularly given the new law the historian made his judgment that these documents had nothing to do with the present discussion about the holocaust nothing , and that is the point , gertrude erismannpeyer , the bank s senior spokeswoman , said in an interview today jewish groups here and in the united states asked a series of questions today why had the bank begun destroying potentially relevant documents precisely when swiss banks are under intense pressure worldwide to provide information about their dealings during the nazi era \? why had the bank chosen this moment to uncover a cache of documents that had laid untouched in a vault ever since 1945 \? how could the historian have possibly been unaware of the implications of destroying documents \? the material now under investigation might be of historical interest or it might not , but that is not the point , said werner rom , head of the israeli cultural center of zurich the issue is that we have a law that became effective dec 13 that prohibits shredding of material that might be relevant from a moral point of view it is absolutely not understandable that something like this has happened switzerland s banking industry has been under siege for months now from jewish groups and from the united states , where senator alfonse m d'amato , republican of new york , has held hearings that publicized embarrassing information from american government archives about swiss dealings during world war ii with jews and with the nazi government two commissions have been trying to answer questions surrounding money , gold and other items that belonged to holocaust victims and may have been put in swiss banks either by the victims themselves or by germans during the third reich one commission , headed by paul a volcker , the former chairman of the federal reserve board , is trying to find dormant bank accounts that belong to holocaust victims the other commission has been set up by the swiss government to analyze relations between swiss banks , the government and hitler s germany the law adopted on dec 13 is intended to protect documents that might be relevant to those inquiries the shredding at the union bank of switzerland might never have come to light had not a night watchman named cristoph meili become curious about documents he saw being destroyed while he was making his rounds the guard took a number of documents from the bank last week and turned them over to the israeli cultural center of zurich , which is usually occupied with providing day care for jewish children today mr meili , 20 years old and the father of two , is himself the target of a criminal investigation into whether he violated bank secrecy laws he has been suspended from his job with the security company that served union bank marcel bosonnet , mr meili s attorney , said the night watchman had been grilled for hours by zurich authorities last weekend , and was repeatedly asked if he had demanded money or accepted money in exchange for documents he had taken mr meili adamantly denied that money had been a motive rather , he said at a news conference on monday with the israeli cultural center , he became convinced that the documents might be of great historic importance and were being improperly destroyed when god put these documents into my hands , i had to act on them , he said repeatedly on monday mr cosandey , the zurich dsitrict attorney , said he had not yet decided whether mr meili had violated bank secrecy laws because he did not work directly for the bank mr bosonnet argued that his client had not violated secrecy laws , but even if he were found to have violated bank secrecy laws , my answer would be that there was an overriding right that supersedes the law because there was such an important interest at stake
the rangers are now one victory away from the final four of the stanley cup playoffs , but their status comes at a precious price while beating the unraveling devils again last night at madison square garden , the rangers lost niklas sundstrom , one of their top forwards , with a broken bone in his left forearm sundstrom was injured when slashed by the stick of new jersey s john maclean in one of several ugly incidents instigated late in the game by the devils , a frustrated bunch they were heavy favorites entering these eastern conference semifinals , but they trail , 31 , in the fourofsevengame series it was a hard game as playoffs go , ranger coach colin campbell said it s a huge price to pay the rangers , who finished 18 points behind the firstplace devils in the regularseason standing , can advance to the next round with a victory in game 5 on sunday at the meadowlands despite the sundstrom injury , the blue shirts had much to celebrate last night wayne gretzky scored his sixth goal of the playoffs two minutes after crashing into the boards when tripped by scott niedermayer later , he fell on his tailbone when checked by bob carpenter after that , gretzky skated in apparent discomfort , flexing his right leg , but said it was nothing serious adam graves netted his first goal of the tournament , opening the scoring on a power play at 5 minutes 49 seconds of the first period esa tikkanen , who , like gretzky , is a former edmonton oiler , is matching gretzky goal for goal he put a puck into an empty net after the devils pulled martin brodeur for an extra attacker during the fightfilled final minute and mike richter stopped 35 devils shots for his second shutout of this series it was the 16th shutout over all by teams in the tournament , tying a national hockey league record set in 1994 brodeur , who shut out the rangers in the opening game , is one of many devils who seemed to be in shock over what has happened i'm not stunned by the rangers , brodeur said i'm stunned by mike richter i do n't think they have the players to beat us mike richter has been the thing but most of the postgame talk was of sundstrom the rangers requested a league investigation of the maclean slash , which occurred , sundstrom said , after he tried to hook maclean i'm very depressed , said sundstrom , who scored 24 goals during the regular season as the right wing on gretzky s line sundstrom , also one of new york s best defensive players , is a regular penalty killer he left the building with his arm in a sling maclean was not available for comment neil smith , the president and general manager of the rangers , said league officials are going to see on the tape that he took a baseball bat type swing , and they are going to do something a suspension of maclean is a possibility a league spokesman said the play would be reviewed most top nhl executives attended the game it s a shame , smith said it s hard to imagine we can continue playing as well when we are dropping key players in the previous round , the rangers lost forward bill berg with a broken leg earlier this season they lost forward aleksei kovalev to a knee injury the winner of this series will play philadelphia or buffalo in the eastern finals for the right to advance to the championship round the flyers lead the other conference semifinal , three games to none , over the sabres the devils again showed a tendency to selfdestruct for the third consecutive game , they appeared to score the tying goal only to have it nullified because they had a player illegally in the goal crease this time it was randy mckay , who turned in a puck with his skate in the blue paint in front of the net even if the skate had been outside the crease , the goal might have been disallowed because mckay might have kicked it into the net although the rule against scoring with the feet has been liberalized this season , referees will still wave off a goal if the puck enters the net because of a distinct kicking motion the rangers had six power plays , the devils only three , an unusual ratio for a devils team that takes pride in its discipline gretzky , irked by niedermayer , made a fingerpointing motion to his head to suggest that the young devil was crazy in the final minute , after the tikkanen goal , reid simpson , new jersey s fighting specialist , began punching new york s aleksandr karpovtsev eventually , several devils began taking swings at ranger counterparts devils coach jacques lemaire said his team was a little frustrated because we ca n't score it seems like nothing works offensively , lemaire said you get tighter and tighter you feel you are losing it a bit doug gilmour , acquired in a trade to add creative offense to a methodical team , does not have a goal or an assist in this series and managed only one shot on goal last night there is a lot of holding and interference on him , lemaire said he does n't cope with it lemaire also gave credit to the rangers they are playing the best i 've seen them play they have n't played like this all year , lemaire said they are right on top everyone is doing his job they have good goaltending they needed it in the first period , when the devils outshot them , 135 but not all the shots were good scoring chances richter said the rangers are preventing them because our team s playing great defense guys are reading off each other really well in all three zones and communicating well , richter said it s not one person playing well it s everybody photos from left , adam graves , wayne gretzky , aleksandr karpovtsev and brian leetch celebrating graves s powerplay goal for the rangers , his first of the playoffs \( barton silverman the new york times \) devils martin brodeur , who

hamilton , ontario , march 2 stalked by a fearless munchkin who gave up the quiet life in sugar land , tex , to cast a short but foreboding shadow on the women s skating scene , michelle kwan again succumbed to the uncommon performance pressure that comes from being pushed to the breaking point by a mere 14yearold this weekend though kwan , only 16 herself , thought it premature to be asked to pass the baton , and her title , to tiny tara lipinski two weeks ago at the united states figure skating championships , she seemed almost resigned when the same scenario recurred this time at an elite international event late saturday night in the champions series final like the impatient vince gill fans huddled in their sleeping bags outside the box office of copps coliseum , kwan could not wait for this twoday competition to leave town it s not one of my best performances , said kwan , who finished second to lipinski after bobbling two landings during her long program , but i 'll take it for now i have to still a world champion , at least until lipinski and a host of skaters led by lu chen of china tackle her at the world championships later this month in lausanne , switzerland , kwan acknowledged that she has her work cut out for her in regaining the psychological edge she once had on her peers after winning nine consecutive events , kwan has fallen short in her last two , undone both times by lipinski kwan rated her confidence level at 7 on a 10point scale , a tad short of championship material it s not very high , she said , but it s getting better after the nationals , it was a 1 , almost a negative after the nationals , kwan s perturbed coach , frank carroll , sat her down and encouraged her to forget about defending titles , to stop looking over her shoulder at lipinski and to start skating for herself the strategy was to have her get a little mad at herself and realize that she potentially is capable of being in a class by herself , carroll said the strategy did not quite work wonders the first time out right now it s michelle s battle against michelle , and i guess i'm glad she s fighting it now instead of next year , said carroll , who envisions kwan wearing a 1998 olympic gold medal in nagano , japan lately , whether burdened by the responsibility of retaining titles or distracted by everybody else s interest in toppling her , kwan has not been her old self even the midsection of her own program has become an enemy i got to that middle section and started thinking about all the jumps i had coming up , and i kind of went , poof , said kwan , who started her long program with two flawless tripletriples only to botch the landings on her next two jumps but it s not the end of the world , she said i 've still got worlds as does lipinski she s able to go out there and defeat a us champion , a world champion , whatever , said her coach , richard callaghan it s just another day at the office for her though none of the women skated their best , elvis stojko did everything except jump out of his skin in seizing the men s title the muscular canadian made history by landing the first quadrupletriple combination in competition and , bolstered by the artistic merit marks of 58 and 59 he received from six of seven judges , made light of the argument that his program lacks artistic depth he is , after all , a certified martial artist with a karate black belt the twotime world champion was the only contestant to give the boards a brash punch as he took to the ice , and after jumpstarting his program with a triple flip , the first of seven triples , he delivered his rivals a knockout punch in the form of his quadrupletriple toe manifesto stojko later said there was more where that came from i'm pushing the envelope , he said photo tara lipinski , center , michelle kwan , left , and irina slutskaya finished 123 in the champions series final \( associated press \)

charm in schubert has a lot to do with conviviality , and therefore with chamber music , and it was a charming program that the chamber music society put together on friday night for its first concert of schubert s bicentenary year none of these pieces went deep , and nobody was pretending they did , which was good charm is all the more effective for being put across with modesty and grace that was how gary hoffman played the arpeggione sonata with short , light phrases , a particularly delicate tone , and an absence of irony even in the cheerful trifles of the last movement he was playing , of course , the cello maybe someone should try reconstructing the instrument for which schubert wrote this piece , the thennewfangled and soonscrapped arpeggione , which was the progeny of an unfortunate match between cello and guitar there was another change in schubert s intended forces , presumably for other reasons , since the tenor voice is not yet an obsolete instrument sung by a soprano and especially by a soprano , beverly hoch , who feels most comfortable when she is about two octaves above the tenor register the song auf dem strom \( on the river \) had no chance of working as a duet for voice and horn ms hoch was in another room , on another planet nor was she so much better placed in the other schubert song with obbligato instrument , der hirt auf dem felsen \( the shepherd on the rock \) , where her brightness made the closing section sound like something out of offenbach happily , david shifrin just got on and played the clarinet part marvelously in the trout quintet , at the end of the concert , ani kavafian gave the violin music the simple elegance of something natural , completely unpretentious , and paul neubauer s dusky viola playing was also good to hear andre watts , moving in the last movement just to the edge of showiness \( and why not \? \) , was the pianist throughout

question when are earnings and cash flow not important for a company in the media business \? answer when a company has so much debt , in wall street s view , that investors essentially disregard quarterly performance and wait for the company to shed some of the load that continues to be the case at time warner inc , which analysts expect to announce strong cash flow and earnings tomorrow for the fourth quarter , with healthy contributions from almost every division but few analysts expect the stock , which has been languishing at about 39 a share , down from its 52week high of 4525 in february 1996 , to get a big lift from the company s financial report instead , many investors may be distracted by whether the company can peel off a big portion of its 18 billion debt by finally unwinding time warner entertainment , its troubled cable television joint venture with the u s west media group the venture s assets include the warner brothers film studio , the cable programmer home box office and 98 million cable subscribers \( time warner has an additional 22 million cable subscribers in its own right \) time warner controls 745 percent of the venture and its 55 billion debt for more than a year , the two companies have been seeking an equitable end to time warner entertainment , but there is no final deal in sight indeed , one person close to the discussions said there appeared to be a 5050 chance that the deal would be completed in two to three months the joint venture was formed in late 1993 , at a time when cabletelephone alliances were the industry fad \( remember the canceled bell atlantictelecommunications merger \? \) nowadays , u s west would like to gain control of the cable subscribers , a wish that time warner may be willing to grant if u s west also agrees to assume a portion of the venture s debt but so far , the companies have been unable to come to terms and there is still no sign of a resolution soon , even though two major distractions have now been removed time warner s merger with turner broadcasting system became final in september and two months later , u s west completed its purchase of continental cablevision yet time warner s chairman , gerald m levin , has made clear that he would like to raise his company s share price by reducing its debt , and he and his president , richard parsons , have been holding onagain , offagain discussions with u s west s president , chuck lillis , in pursuit of a settlement that might do just that u s west is the key catalyst , said david londoner , a media analyst at wertheim schroder company if the deal gets done , the stock will respond because it will reduce overall debt and simplify the capital structure if the talks fell apart , it would hurt the stock big but the terms of the negotiations keep changing , and several large time warner shareholders who are unhappy that the talks are taking so long , have become convinced that the company should bring in an outsider with a strong track record for closing deals , rather than leaving the negotiations to mr levin and mr parsons mr levin and mr parsons both declined to be interviewed the terms under discussion are roughly as follows u s west initially invested 25 billion for its stake if one assumes that investment is now worth 4 billion , in the arrangement now under discussion , u s west would give its stake in time warner entertainment and , in exchange , would assume full ownership of cable systems serving three million subscribers , as well as 2 billion of the joint venture s debt at the going rate of 2 , 000 a subscriber , therefore , u s west would walk away from the venture with 6 billion of assets and 2 billion in debt but then , how would time warner slash its liabilities further \? time warner was considering a second step , according to several people close to the talks the company would still have a total of nine million cable subscribers , consisting of the remaining 68 million subscribers in time warner entertainment as well as the 22 million subscribers to cable systems owned by the parent company so in this second step , time warner would spin off the cable systems into a separate corporate entity , owned by existing time warner shareholders , which would assume some portion of time warner s debt the talks are suffering from several main sticking points , however , according to people close to the discusssion u s west has been dragging its feet , in part because it believes time warner is under more pressure than u s west and therefore the giant telephone company can take its time moreover , u s west is more skittish about a deal these days as a result of its purchase of continental cablevision , which increased u s west s own debt u s west would like to spin off its u s west media group to shareholders but u s west is wary of proceeding unless u s west media group has a very attractive balance sheet as a result , u s west is now less willing to have u s west media take on debt than it might have been eight or nine months ago in addition , neither side seems able to decide what form the deal should take even when and if the framework is arranged , a question will remain which cable systems will u s west get , and which will time warner keep \? in such a tense relationship , it seems inevitable that there could be endless dickering so fluid are the negotiations that just two months ago , the proposed restructuring was different , according to a person familiar with the process under that approach , u s west would have received ownership of cable systems serving two million subscribers , valued at 4 billion based on the going price of about 2 , 000 each , but assume none of the debt for many on wall street , this approach to a spinoff had particular appeal because it would more clearly separate time warner s programming businesses from its cable systems cable may continue to be the dominant delivery system , but it is subject to competitive and regulatory risks , which is why in recent years cable stocks have been trading at much lower multiples to earnings than have the shares of programming companies seven years ago , in the fierce battle between warner communiations and paramount communications over time inc , paramount offered 50 a share for time stock in the merged company has yet to reach that number , a fact that longtime shareholders are keenly aware of
noordwijk , the netherlands , may 23 the leaders of the 15 european union nations gathered here today to discuss treaty revisions they are to sign next month , but the daylong session was dominated by britain s new prime minister , tony blair , who has promised to sweeten his country s sour relations with the continent since assuming power in an overwhelming electoral victory may 1 , mr blair s government has signaled its interest in becoming a partner with europe and has already reversed a position of the predecessor conservative government by agreeing to sign a workplacereform protocol called the social chapter today mr blair , at 44 notably more youthful than his principal counterparts jacques chirac and helmut kohl , appeared in europe for the first time since becoming prime minister , and crowds followed him around this north sea resort and left other leaders unattended , the way a gallery trails the favorite at a golf tournament while other competitors play out their rounds ignored for his part , mr blair showed none of the timidity of a rookie and clearly reveled in the attention asked at a news conference this evening how the other leaders had taken to the smile , the new british look in europe mr blair beamed and said , a bit like the british electorate , i'm tempted to say that could not be immediately corroborated , but many of the leaders expressed relief at having a british leader who was not antagonistic it means the negotiation atmosphere has become easier , said lena hjelmwollen , the swedish foreign minister hens van mierlo , the dutch foreign minister , interrupted the official lunch to say , this is a welcome party for mr blair where the former prime minister , john major , had gone into a defensive crouch at these meetings and worked to prevent the european union from imposing unwanted policies on britain , mr blair went on the offensive and said he thought the europeans needed to adjust their sights to the needs of individual citizens rather than of bureaucracy today s meeting had been called not to arrive at any decisions but to try to produce a political consensus on matters to be incorporated in a new treaty at next month s summit conference in amsterdam much of the day was devoted to organizational matters , like how many commissioners each country ought to have once the union expands to include new members from eastern europe , and mr blair betrayed some impatience over what british government sources said struck him as misplaced priorities europe must refocus , he said he told the other leaders that europe must become more competitive , that the emphasis had to be on the creation of jobs , the training of unskilled people , consumer rights , crime , the environment and opening up opportunities , the things that really matter to people out there , he said , motioning out beyond the hall speaking to a group that has not been as quick as britain in shedding state enterprises and labor restrictions , he said , business cannot become so clogged with regulation that employers ca n't move anymore these were the themes underlying the labor party s stunning success , and mr blair , currently a guest of particular allure to european politicians , noted that some of the leaders paying particular attention to his comments faced elections of their own he slipped effortlessly into his new labor , new britain campaign sloganeering mode , saying , new europe , new era , and he added that his goal was not an ideological europe but a europe that works , a wordperfect echo from the labor campaign he began his visit with a 30minute meeting with leaders of european socialist parties that his party has long been associated with , and british government sources said he emerged with the strong impression that they had abandoned old enthusiasms for expensive , burdensome regulations he warned that there would be serious difficulties in britain if signing the social chapter prompted other countries to come forth with rafts of social legislation that could damage competitiveness the leaders next meet on june 16 and 17 to sign the treaty that is aimed at refining agreements made in the 1992 maastricht treaty , which established the european union , successor to the european economic community that is expected to clear the decks for the next major program a common currency for those countries that decide they want to join the first wave of nations in 1999 and bring their economies into line under the economic and fiscal criteria for qualification
los angeles , march 14 mikhail markhasev had a side hidden from most people around him to them , the 18yearold ukrainian immigrant , who has been charged with murdering ennis cosby , was a quiet , polite young man , so quiet and so polite , in fact , that he went almost unnoticed and tended to slip from memory he dressed like a normal teenager , wore the baggy clothes like everyone , seemed normal , said his north hollywood landlady , olga faynshteyn nobody ever complained about him his boss at the mainly seconds plant and pottery store , jim herzoff , remembers mr markhasev as someone who was really nice to customers , spoke good english , always on time to work and that s about all there is to say for caradawn holter , who took spanish with mr markhasev at mcauliffe middle school , hardly any impression of those days is left , so quiet and withdrawn was this young ukrainian do n't remember him well , she said and for robert kladifko , the principal of reseda high school , there is no memory of mr markhasev at all , only an old transcript , which , as he reads it , gives no indication of anything wrong , but today something is wrong , of course , for mr markhasev sits in a downtown los angeles jail , awaiting arraignment later this month on charges that in the earlyhour darkness of jan 16 , on a lonely side road on the city s west side , he fatally shot ennis cosby , 27 , son of the comedian bill cosby , as ennis cosby struggled to fix a flat tire if convicted of murder and attempted robbery , he could be put to death the meeting between the men was happenstance , investigators say , a sad nexus of someone with car trouble forced into the dangerous proximity of someone on the prowl for trouble , namely to commit armed robbery it is clear what brought mr cosby to that point on that dark road but what brought mr markhasev to that point , if he is indeed the killer that the police say he is \? the police have given out only a few details other than to enumerate the charges against mr markhasev and to say that they think he alone was involved in the slaying it was a crime that stunned the nation because the cosby clan , both in real life and through television , has come to symbolize the ideal american family interviews with city , state and federal officials , as well as with neighbors and acquaintances of mr markhasev , help fill in some of the missing detail , as do other published and broadcast reports the tale that emerges is one of a young ukrainian who immigrated to the united states in 1989 , at the age of 10 lived with his mother , victoria , in various parts of hollywood and orange county initially did well in school , then began to slide down the slippery slope of drugs and crime by the time he and mr cosby came face to face he holding a gun , according to the police , and mr cosby struggling with a brokendown 130 , 000 sports car mr markhasev was , as one investigator put it , a kid really hard beyond his years , someone who had been arrested on charges of possessing marijuana , had been charged with assaulting someone with a deadly weapon and had done time in a juvenile work camp there are many unanswered questions in this tale , but the biggest of all is what precipitated the slide that led to that hardness and , the police say , to a botched robbery that ended in death because until that slide began , mr markhasev was , by almost any measure , off to a good start in adding his few paragraphs to the great american success story for the most part , so far as is known , he and his mother , who has made no comment on his case , lived mainly in areas of los angeles where there are a number of other eastern european immigrants , ending up last year in north hollywood in the valley village neighborhood their landlady said the family , which has been widely identified as russian , came from the russianspeaking part of ukraine , then part of the soviet union they were the quietest people in my apartment building , ms faynshteyn recalled then the police called , around 5 pm on wednesday i let them in , ms faynshteyn said they said they had business on the second floor mr markhasev s first business with the police appears to have occurred while he was attending los alamitos high school in orange county however , neither the police nor school officials will say what that runin involved before that , as a student at gardner elementary school in west hollywood , john burroughs middle school in hollywood and then at mcauliffe middle school in los alamitos , he appears to have been troublefree in fact , school records indicate that at the burroughs school he was in a program for gifted students from the mcauliffe school , mr markhasev went to los alamitos and then to reseda high school in the san fernando valley section of los angeles he was there for only a few months , however , and then , according to the police , surfaced next in los pinos conservation camp , a detention facility for juveniles in orange county the police refused today to release details on that detention , which lasted six months , saying it had nothing to do with the cosby case but it very well could have resulted from the assault charge , because the marijuana charge involved only the relatively lesser offense of possession even as a student at reseda , mr markhasev showed promise , though he had already had at least one serious brush with the law school officials say he attended regularly and maintained aboveaverage grades likewise , at los alamitos high , some of the students who remember mr markhasev recall him as someone who was nice and , of course , quiet the oneword description of mr markhasev that comes up like a mantra whenever his name is mentioned he was nice , joy williams , a former classmate who dated him as a freshman , told the orange county register i do n't want to say too nice , but really , really nice but as the high school years passed at los alamitos , somehow , for some unexplained reason , mr markhasev began to change , old classmates recall , though none saw any genuine threat or danger in the change rather , they say , mr mark hasev seemed to become more reserved , often to the point of being unfriendly , and he began to dress the way members of southern california gangs do , though there is no evidence that he was anything but a socalled wannabe gang member he was , like , a loner , remembered another former classmate , maya demmerelle photos the composite drawing the police released of the suspect in the killing of ennis cosby , and the man arrested in the killing , mikhail markhasev \( photographs by the associated press \)
longville , minn , june 28 on the other hand , carol seymour , who grew up here and lives in vancouver , wash , was just as certain that she had raced in the first contest oh , man , mrs seymour said when asked this week to put a date on that first race , that had to be in the 50 s oh , the mid to late 50 s while the races may not have put longville \( population 224 , says the sign at the edge of town \) on the map , they have become an institution here in the heart of northern minnesota resort country , on the edge of the chippewa national forest the legislature acknowledged it as the official 'turtle racing capital of the world , ' said mr weins , who did not question whether a state government had the authority to confer such a title besides , none of that mattered to the 340 children carrying turtles in plastic buckets , cardboard boxes , ice coolers and metal washtubs who converged on wednesday in the middle of main street they were here for one reason to find out who owned or had rented the fastest turtle as they do every wednesday from early june through august , the contestants , most of whom were vacationers from nearby resorts , began lining up at 1 pm each one presented a turtle to the two registrars , who made sure no snapping turtles got in and spoiled the fun , and then attached a numbered sticker to each animal and a matching numbered button to each human some contestants , like mrs seymour s 13yearold son , john , had found their turtles on nearby roads he was fast , so i knew he was a winner , john said of the racer he had named jack others turned to turtle entrepreneurs like 10yearold nick vasko , who operated victory turtles from a plastic wading pool stationed just a few feet from the registration line nearby were six other turtle rental outfits , including nick s little league teammate , 11yearold nathan eck , who is the n in nm turtles the m is nathan s 8yearold brother , matt for 3 each , nick and his colleagues rent turtles that meet the fourinch minimum length for racing , along with plastic buckets for carrying them , to competitors if the turtle and bucket are returned undamaged , the renter gets 2 back of course , some contestants become so fond of their turtles that the animals find new homes in such exotic places as iowa and indiana the turtle population depletion of the state s more than 10 , 000 lakes is not noticeable two o'clock is racing time , and the contests always start promptly local officials allow main street , which leads to the firehouse , to be blocked off for only so long gary knox , the owner of the minne teepee resort , who has been calling the races for 15 years , summoned the first 10 contestants the first 10 who registered to the middle of the street turtle racing is a game of circles , and longville has three painted in a bull seye pattern on the street the smallest , a white one about 6 feet in diameter , serves as the starting line that is ringed by another white one about 30 feet in diameter it is the finish line just outside this is a yellow circle that serves as the line beyond which spectators namely parents , grandparents , aunts and uncles are not allowed for each race , 10 competitors start in the inner circle when mr knox says go , the children set down their turtles and run to the finish line with any luck , without stepping on the racers the first turtle that wanders across the finish line , which usually takes about a minute , wins a green ribbon the turtle that has moved the shortest distance receives a white slowpoke ribbon tyler and spencer seifert , 8yearold identical twins with identical brush cuts from nearby boy river , bounced up and down as they waited with their sister , 14yearold jenny , for their heat to come up when it was time for nos 238 , 239 and 240 to race , the seiferts hit the street tyler s turtle edged spencer s for the victory i 'd like to kiss my turtle , tyler said , but it s too dirty after the heats , all the slowpokes had a runoff to determine the grand slowpoke and all the winners had a runoff for the grand prize , which is a handmade wooden trophy , turtle on a stick a small stuffed animal went to the grand slowpoke both turtles and their handlers will get their pictures in the weekly newspaper , the pine cone press tom moran of new prague , minn , who won the grand prize , said the secret of his success was renting the right turtle , no 21 it was trying to get out of the bucket , he said the grand slowpoke , tom perlach , 5 of edina , minn , just shrugged even though the races on most wednesdays draw 300 or more contestants , whose parents then patronize matt s laundromat or judy s casuals or susan s top drawer or frosty s ice cream , there is no room for complacency turtle races have also started in nisswa , a nearby town , and in another town whose name no one could remember but we 're official , mr weins said photo haley reiter , 5 , of walker , minn , prepared her entry

in essex county , which has the largest welfare system in the state and the eighth largest in the country , debate is heating up as it is around the nation about how much of the program will remain in government hands and how much will fall into the private sector county executive james treffinger , a republican , has proposed placing all social services required under the new federal welfare law in the hands of nonprofit agencies , a proposal that worries government unions and local church groups in fact , texas and several other states have gone further , opening the door to bidding by forprofit private companies to handle their welfare programs and nothing is keeping essex county from doing the same we are not closing the door on anything , said county freeholder sheila y oliver , the democratic in charge of the committee that will make final recommendations after a jan 13 meeting involving 200 people interested in welfare the government and nonprofits cannot do it alone , she added it will require input from everyone , including the private sector right now the focus of welfare workers in essex county is getting benefits to their 75 , 000 clients changes in federal welfare law , as well as the state initiative called work first , require more extensive efforts to get people off welfare job and education placement , child care and counseling for drug , alcohol and psychological problems ms oliver said the freeholders are likely to vote in march on the proposal that emerges from her committee any change taking administration of the program out of county hands would need the approval of the state s human services commissioner , william waldman last year a bill that would have eased such a change stalled in the state senate the measure , which could be taken up again this year , would extend the time essex and hudson counties could contract welfare services to outside businesses from one year to five years it also would have allowed the two counties to contract out some services that government has historically handled , including determining who is eligible for benefits the essex freeholders passed a resolution opposing the legislation on the ground that it gave outside bidders too much leeway this does not mean , ms oliver said , that there is no role for outsiders if the county is going to meet the new state and federal goals i maintain that we cannot do this alone , she said we need the assistance of outside institutions mr treffinger supports the bill , calculating that it could save the county up to 10 million the county s share of the cost of its welfare program is now more than 25 million a year and at times its spending has topped 58 million , he said even if the legislation does n't pass , he wants to use nonprofit groups , though he does n't think the savings would be as great my goal is to replace a large and often unresponsive bureaucracy with communitybased organizations that have meaningful relationships and ties to their community , he said representatives from lockheed martin ims have contacted the county about delivering some welfare services , according to ron jury , a spokesman for the company , in teaneck , nj he said that the company is one of several interested in administering the texas welfare system and parts of those in other states we do not want to control policy but i think that with our experience , resources and technology we can run a welfare system , he said , adding that the company has 10 years experience in helping states run social service programs , including child support collection to and training none of this sits well with local 1081 of the communication workers of america , which includes 956 welfare workers in essex county david weiner , the president , said his union is being used as a scapegoat , that essex county has one of the lowest administrative costs per client in the state saying that a hiring freeze had left the welfare program short 300 workers , he asserted that the county should increase the staff , not farm out their work to outsiders or let the state take over the program , as it threatened to do in 1995 many church groups agree , including the 300member newark north jersey committee of black churchmen this is one of the largest welfare systems in the nation , said dr edward w verner , minister at st james ame church in newark to turn its duties over to communitybased organizations is inconceivable they do n't have the staff , the training , nor the expertise to do this it would be a grand mess other authorities on welfare say that whatever essex county does , the effectiveness of its welfare programs will depend more on the services provided rather than on who provides them judith m gueron , president of the manpower demonstration research corporation , a nonprofit study group , said that one of its recent studies in california found no discernible differences between privately run work programs and their staterun counterparts richard p nathan , director of rockefeller institute of government of the state university of new york , offered this analysis congress said give it to the states and new jersey passed it along to the counties and so forth there is great tension and frustration about welfare and what it stands for and this whole episode is really about people saying , 'we ca n't do it right and do n't want it , so who else can we give it to \?

prague andrej chalimon , age 5 , makes his film debut on the doorstep of a man old enough to be his grandfather the boy carries a small suitcase , has one shoelace untied and is sniffling because his mother has just deserted him the movie andrej appears in , kolya , a czech film set in the 1980 s , is about the transforming relationship between a russian boy and a rascally czech bachelor who is humanized by the responsibility of looking after the abandoned child but focusing a czech film on a russian boy with a russian child playing the part was risky , the film s director , jan sverak , said czechs did not look fondly on russians during the more than 40 years that czechoslovakia was part of the soviet empire everyone told us , 'do n't call the movie 'kolya' it s too obviously a russian name , ' mr sverak said in an interview at a restaurant in this city s old town he tried hundreds of other names , he said , but none worked as well the fact that kolya , released here last may , has become the first boxoffice smash since the fall of the communists is proof , he said , of how soon czechs forgive and forget kolya was made for 12 million and financed jointly by czech state television , the czech ministry of culture and a british company run by eric abraham called portobello pictures mr sverak , 31 , is the preeminent czech film maker of his generation his reputation is based on versatility as well as talent the elementary school , his first czech feature , was nominated for an academy award for best foreignlanguage film in 1992 he followed this with a scifi movie , accumulator 1 , and in 1994 made a popular czech road movie , the ride in an effort to reach a broader audience , mr abraham and mr sverak are making the director s next film , set in the czech republic , in english zdenek sverak , who is jan s father and one of the nation s most esteemed actors , wrote the script for kolya and stars as the czech bachelor the film has been heralded at the toronto and venice film festivals and is a nominee for a golden globe for best foreign film \( the awards ceremony is tonight \) miramax discovered kolya at the cannes international film festival last may and plans to release the film in the united states on friday kolya is also the official czech entry for the 1997 academy award for best foreignlanguage film the movie uses the velvet revolution of 1989 , when communism petered out here , as background for its rascalmeetsboy story but the prosperity this city has enjoyed since the russians decamped proved a disadvantage to the film makers they had to dress prague down with 15yearold cars and scatter leaves and weeds on the sidewalks politics aside , kolya tells the story of the boy and the bachelor , a cellist who in order to get enough money to buy a secondhand car agrees to marry a russian woman who needs czech papers when the woman flees to western europe , she leaves the boy behind the elder mr sverak , who has been admired by czechs for his comic roles and scripts since the 1970 s , wrote the screenplay based on a friend s synopsis about a librarian who befriends a young boy from the outset , both sveraks knew that hanging a movie on a 5yearold moreover a 5yearold from a different culture would be potentially troublesome you ca n't persuade a kid to work for more than 20 minutes , said the younger mr sverak , who has two children , ages 5 and 8 jan sverak is soft spoken but very precise in his nearperfect english after 20 minutes he has no power left and to make a scene eight times , either the same or better , is an ordeal together with mr abraham , his british coproducer , the director hired a russian casting company and gave instructions look for a pretty face , but not too pretty because then it s boring smart maybe older than 5 but looking like a 5yearold after five visits to moscow , including three with his father , mr sverak still had no boy a month before filming was to begin , new instructions went out we asked the casting people to go to the kindergartens with a video camera and look for the biggest troublemakers , jan sverak said often the troublemakers have the biggest personalities when he came across andrej , mr sverak said , he was charmed just as important , he was convinced that the child was intelligent enough to follow direction \( which would be given to him in russian , since he spoke no czech \) one week into the shooting , however , mr sverak wanted to look for another boy mr sverak needed andrej to do a crucial scene in a bathtub in which he makes a pretend phone call to an aunt and cries but the child looked too happy we asked him to put his mouth down and he did , mr sverak said but still , all the time , stars were dancing in his eyes he consulted with the boy s mother , who had accompanied her son , and she told andrej a sad story about his dog it did the trick then there was the fact that andrej kept looking into the camera lens eventually a russian assistant was able to coach him not to look at the camera , and at the same time , mr sverak said , the child learned the basic principles of acting indeed , as the shooting progressed , andrej began inquiring every morning whether the day s work would require more tears andrej also very quickly mastered the czech word for needing to use the toilet , mr sverak said with a laugh he knew with this one word he had enormous power that he could get 100 adults to stop and turn off the lights photo zdenek sverak , left , plays a czech bachelor and andrej chalimon a russian child in kolya \( miramax

montville , nj , aug 6 officer letitia cook s moment of reckoning came in a barroom one night in 1987 , when she and her partner broke up a fight before backup arrived she was new on the job and , as this town s first female police officer , anxious to prove her moxie to the male officers who showed up minutes later the men want to see if you can handle yourself , said officer cook , who was 21 when she got her job i got right down on the ground with everyone else that s when they stepped back and said 'all right , she can handle herself she can help us' ten years later , though , officer cook is still the only woman on the police force in montville , a town of 18 , 000 about 25 miles northwest of manhattan and montville is hardly an exception most suburban police departments still employ only a handful of female officers , and hundreds have none at all they lag far behind the major cities , where advocacy groups and lawsuits have put pressure on the police forces to change their ways approximately 15 percent of officers in the nation s largest departments are women , up from 3 percent 20 years ago but the hiring practices in small cities and towns have gone largely unchallenged as a result , suburban police chiefs are more likely to cling to tradition , advocates say , doing nothing to encourage women to apply for the handful of job openings each year in 1995 , the last year for which national figures are available , only 53 percent of police officers in new jersey were women that was one of the lowest percentages in the nation , according to the united states justice department in connecticut , it was 71 percent new york had a higher percentage , 119 , because of the numbers from new york city women represented about 15 percent of that police force , the largest in the nation nationally , 88 percent of officers were women suburban police chiefs say the situation is not all their fault most women still shun police work because of misperceptions about the job , they say as long as women make up only a fraction of the applicants , the chiefs say , most police jobs will go to men women seem intimidated about the job , apprehensive about the job , said chief william moffett of the cherry hill , nj , police department , where 6 of the 120 officers are women the hours are not always great dealing with violence , things of that nature , might not be attractive to them they may have the perception that they ca n't do it a few smaller departments around the country have worked hard to make women feel welcome in new haven , recruiters hand out fliers in malls and day care centers they hang posters in beauty parlors and advertise job openings in newsletters for women s groups around connecticut the department now has 66 female officers , 15 percent of its force , up from 4 percent just seven years ago women are not going out of their way to seek out nontraditional jobs , so you have to go after them , said kay d codish , the director of training for the new haven department , who helped overhaul its recruiting program you need to say in your advertising , 'we want women' you need a chief who is committed to the idea , but it s a very lonely position to take jennifer raymond , a police officer in new haven , said a flier in her doctor s office persuaded her to apply for the job the flier said the city wanted female officers , and that made the prospect less daunting , she said it made me feel like i was wanted , like there was a place for me , ms raymond said advocates say recruiting women is more than just a matter of ending discrimination they say women have a different approach to policing from men , tending to be less antagonistic that is particularly valuable in community policing because female officers are more likely to talk through a situation than use force , and they interact regularly with people in the neighborhood , the advocates say citizens' complaints go down because women tend to be better communicators , said penny e harrington , the director of the national center for women and policing , in los angeles they try to solve problems rather than make an arrest and go away but many women who apply for police jobs , she said , are thwarted by tests that emphasize physical strength in connecticut , where a state agency determines physical requirements for police candidates , women are not expected to complete as many situps and pushups as men , but ms codish said she would rather see no requirements at all new jersey eliminated a statewide physical test for police jobs after a group of women who failed it filed a lawsuit in 1985 but most departments in new jersey there are more than 500 still put applicants through their own fitness tests , with each chief deciding how rigorous it should be it s not advantageous for women , said donna roman , one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit , who is now the only female officer in caldwell , nj i'm not against a test to make sure applicants are in good shape , but let s come up with one reasonable test instead of letting everyone call their own shots

tokyo , thursday , july 3 japan mobilized more than 130 ships today to battle a major oil spill from a tanker that ran aground in tokyo bay on wednesday , spreading a huge slick through the heavily traveled waterway and sending fumes into tokyo and its suburbs the japanese maritime safety agency at first estimated that about four million gallons of crude oil had spilled from the japaneseowned diamond grace , but this morning said the total was about onetenth that amount by comparison , the exxon valdez spilled 11 million gallons off alaska in 1989 , but experts caution that the size of a spill alone is not a good indicator of potential damage by early this morning the slick was more than 11 miles wide , spanning the width of tokyo bay thin layers of oil had already hit a few miles of shoreline in yokohama and kawasaki on the western side of the bay and were within half a mile of points in chiba prefecture on the eastern shore the slick , more than nine miles long , had started out heading northeast toward downtown tokyo and nearby eastern suburbs but was not moving rapidly in that direction this morning the diamond grace ran aground about four miles southeast of a pier in yokohama shortly after 10 am wednesday morning , rupturing 2 of the ship s 14 oilcontaining compartments none of the crew of 25 were injured by 1 pm the oil leak had stopped the tanker , which was delivering 257 , 000 tons of crude oil from the united arab emirates to a mitsubishi oil company refinery near tokyo , was refloated with the help of tugboats and proceeded under its own power on wednesday night to its original destination the light crude oil began evaporating rapidly in the summer heat , creating foul odors thirteen children at a tokyo elementary school were taken to a hospital after falling ill from breathing the fumes , but they were not hurt seriously the government set up an emergency task force on wednesday , and by this morning more than 130 ships from the maritime safety agency , the japanese military and private contractors were deploying booms to contain the oil , spreading mats to absorb it and spraying chemicals to disperse it such barriers and cleanup methods are often ineffective , however the impact of an oil spill depends not only on the volume spilled but on the type of oil , the weather and other environmental conditions tokyo bay is far from pristine hardly any natural coastline is left , landfill having been dumped into the bay to extend the land area to accommodate the region s swelling population and heavy industry still , there are some tidal mud flats with wildlife and some parks along the shore , as well as other attractions , including tokyo disneyland , which is just east of tokyo fishermen are worried that catches of clams and sea bass and the harvest of seaweed will be disrupted damage could be commercial as much as environmental if shipping is badly disrupted , which has so far not been the case , it could hurt commerce in japan s major population and business center tokyo electric power company closed off the water intakes to its power plants along the bay on wednesday the tanker is registered in panama but is owned by affiliates of mitsubishi oil and nippon yusen kk , japan s largest shipping company the vessel was built in 1994 and has only a single steel hull an international agreement requires tankers built after july 1996 to have double hulls to help prevent spills a spokesman for the maritime safety agency said officials suspected human error as the cause of the accident the authorities questioned the ship s captain , hidenori tsunematsu , and the pilot , who was hired locally , on why the ship was traveling in a shallow area where the reefs come within about 40 feet of the surface the site of the accident has long been considered a dangerous spot , but it is marked by buoys the spill is the second serious one in japan this year in january a russian tanker broke apart in the sea of japan and released about 16 million gallons of fuel oil that eventually covered long stretches of japan s western coast with goo map of tokyo bay showing site where supertanker began to spill oil a tanker ran aground , spreading oil over tokyo bay yesterday
long way to go black and white in america by jonathan coleman 451 pp new york atlantic monthly press 2650 it has become possible , in the last few years , to glimpse the emerging outlines of a kind of guiltfree zone of racial conversation black scholars like randall kennedy and glenn loury , and black journalists like william raspberry and stanley crouch none of them , save perhaps loury , conservative have very consciously laid down the bludgeon of racial accusation this act of unilateral disarmament offers an invitation to liberal white scholars and journalists , accustomed to treading ever so gingerly , to think and write about vexing issues like poverty and crime and academic standards without looking over their shoulders at the racial proprieties this ought to be an exhilarating invitation but the impulse to see practically everything as an expression of racism is very deeply ingrained , in whites as well as blacks it s an impulse , or a need , that provides an unintended second meaning to the title of jonathan coleman s book , long way to go coleman is a white journalist , formerly with cbs news , who spent time in the early 1990 s in milwaukee , one of the most segregated and impoverished cities in the country the mission that he set himself was simply to talk to everyone leaders and led , white and black and thus come to understand how , despite the heroic gains of the civil rights struggle , the economic and psychic gulf between the races could remain so vast it s a serious and important task , and coleman is a very conscientious guide , a christian pilgrim of the inner city he has no ideology to vindicate he does , however , come equipped with a set of conventional liberal attitudes at the very outset of his journey , coleman arranges to meet with michael mcgee , an alderman and selfdescribed revolutionary , and jerrel jones , an entrepreneur who is mcgee s pal coleman gives mcgee a respectful hearing as he talks of taking up arms , and he s disturbed when jones declares that , no matter what his achievements , whites will always view him simply as a nigger but then he reflects that he was viewing the problem through my lens , not jones s it was a mistake i would have to keep in mind as time went on , a mistake that in large part had to do with the unconsciousness of being white our pilgrim turns out to be afflicted with a rather severe case of liberal guilt coleman insists on seeing mcgee as an authentic , if deeply troubling , tribune of black opinion , and at one point he taxes milwaukee s mayor , john norquist , with failing to conduct a dialogue with the alderman yet mcgee strikes the reader as the kind of dangerous huckster who makes a career out of exploiting racial anger , and it comes as not much of a shock to learn at the end of the book that he has formed a friendship with the head of the white aryan resistance coleman seems to lack the language of condemnation he writes that it was disappointing to hear him talk of sabotage coleman is so persuaded of the salience of race and the ubiquity of racism that sometimes he fails to notice his own evidence to the contrary one of mcgee s constituents , maron alexander , a proud but hardpressed member of the black working class , tells the author that when he died , he wanted his headstone to reflect that he was an american , not a black american , that as far as he was concerned way too much was made of race coleman passes over this profession of faith in a nonracial identity without comment but when , sadly , the alexanders' daughter , tennille , is arrested for bringing a gun to school to impress gang members , coleman observes the same stuff went on in the suburbs , but you simply did n't hear about it or read about it it was another form of inequity , another way in which white privilege quietly exerted itself this is , of course , untrue , and the reader has to wonder if the alexanders themselves would agree perhaps they would say that tennille had fallen in with a bad crowd coleman is so desperate not to blame tennille that he practically denies her the power of individual agency a form of condescension that borders on what jim sleeper describes as liberal racism in his recent book of the same name at times , coleman moves well beyond the platitudes the most intriguing character in long way to go is howard fuller , who became superintendent of milwaukee s schools while coleman was doing his research a former black nationalist , fuller opposes busing to achieve integration , and advocates an allblack school with an afrocentric curriculum he is a figure of stoical dignity and unshakable commitment a race man , as coleman writes and yet by accepting the superintendent s job , and by trying to enlist white businessmen in his campaign to reform a dismal school system , fuller becomes a target for black leaders who hold the views that he himself once did he s accused of selling out when he fires a black principal
college park , md , may 24 undefeated princeton and upstart maryland captured tense onegoal victories at byrd stadium today to reach the national collegiate athletic association division i tournament final the assembly of 30 , 580 , the biggest ever for lacrosse , saw the tigers freeze the ball for the last 4 minutes 40 seconds of their game against duke to seal a 109 victory maryland , ranked 10th in the tournament s field of 12 , failed to do the same for the last two minutes against syracuse but managed to hold on for an 1817 triumph so princeton \( 140 \) , seeded no 1 and the defending champion , will play maryland \( 114 \) here monday for the championship no 3 syracuse \( 113 \) , which played in an ncaa semifinal for the 15th season in a row , and no 5 duke \( 124 \) went home they both played well , but not quite well enough roy simmons jr , the syracuse coach , said we are used to a street fight , and we had a good one today we got thrown by maryland matt hahn scored the winning goal for the terrapins at 12 39 of the final period after syracuse had finally tied the score at 1717 it was hahn who had the winning goal in overtime last sunday in a quarterfinal upset of no 2 virginia , 109 warriors is how coach dick edell described his overachieving maryland athletes we did n't intend this to be a shootout with syracuse , for sure , he said but that is how the match turned out in the second half , when 19 goals were scored the game s total of 35 goals was 3 short of the ncaa tournament record after hahn s score , the terrapins twice lost the ball to syracuse , but the orange attackers never got off a good shot on the maryland goalie , sean keenan casey powell was an outstanding performer as usual for syracuse and scored four goals , as did his teammate rob kavovit ryan powell , casey s freshman brother , had three , his last the 17th for the orange , which trailed by 43 after one period and by 97 at halftime as for duke , the blue devils could have used basketball s shot clock to force princeton to take a shot in the final 4 40 of their contest after chris massey had scored princeton s 10th and final goal , the tigers' james mitchell won the subsequent faceoff his teammates then passed the ball for the remainder of the game , and the blue devils could not snatch it away this became a hard game for princeton after an easy beginning the tigers' first six shots went through goalie joe kirmser as they took a 61 lead jesse hubbard , lorne smith and massey seemed able to score at will then came a furious duke rally that tied the score at 66 at halftime and then gave the blue devils a twogoal lead , 97 , at the close of the third john fay and his brother , ed , from canton , ny , found crevices in the princeton defense and punched goals past patrick cairns duke outscored princeton by 81 in the second and third periods but it was all princeton in the final 15 minutes of play the tigers' discipline never wavered , and they produced three goals , by jason osier , todd eichelberger and massey , to none for the blue devils as 97 became 109 , tigers massey and john fay led their teams with three goals apiece
washington , march 26 a leading candidate for ambassador to france has withdrawn , tired of waiting for the call from the white house there is no american ambassador in important countries , like russia , japan and germany and many top jobs under secretary of state madeleine k albright await appointees two months into president clinton s second term , the selection of the senior diplomatic corps has bogged down , a victim of white house indecision caused in part by the furor over campaign financing with the administration under scrutiny for the favors that it may or may not have granted donors to last year s presidential campaign , white house lawyers are scrutinizing the backgrounds of potential nominees for anything that might drag mr clinton into a new controversy the awarding of ambassadorships has always been a game of spoils , with choice posts often going to top contributors , but now politics has further intruded , sowing confusion and anxiety and it has left some prospective appointees hanging , with jobs , businesses and reputations on the line as mr clinton makes up his mind and the lawyers make sure that his decisions create no new headaches now the process appears to have claimed its first victim frank g wisner , the ambassador to india and one of the nation s most respected career diplomats , has withdrawn from consideration to be ambassador to france , a senior administration official said today mr wisner , along with felix g rohatyn , the investment banker from new york , was considered a top contender to replace pamela harriman , who died on feb 5 but he informed president clinton and secretary albright last week that he would leave the foreign service and take a job with american international group , the insurance company , the official said \( the official added that it would be wrong to assume that mr wisner s withdrawal would guarantee the post for mr rohatyn \) the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said mr wisner had personal reasons to step down now but a close friend of his said today that mr wisner simply could not wait any longer for mr clinton s decision mr wisner , who recently returned to new delhi after a visit to the united states , could not be reached for comment tonight the embassy in paris is only one of 14 with no ambassadors , and dozens of others are expected to open when the current ambassadors rotate out this summer the system has lost common sense , said one person under consideration for an appointment , who , despite having clearance to see some of the country s top secrets , still faces an arduous background check by the white house everybody is so afraid of scandal richard n haass , the director of foreign policy studies at the brookings institution , said the delays in appointing people to the senior diplomatic posts not to mention the hurdle of senate confirmation could hamper mr clinton s foreign policy initiatives by the time you get people named , vetted and through the confirmation process , you 'll be lucky to get people into place by the summer , many by the fall , he said in that case you 've lost most of the year , which traditionally is the best year for foreign policy in a second term for her part , ms albright said delays in appointments would not affect the state department s work she noted that many top officials , like deputy secretary of state strobe talbott , are staying on , and that even vacant embassies have capable chiefs of mission serving in lieu of ambassadors obviously it would be better if we had everybody in place , ms albright said in a telephone interview the other day but we 're doing fine now some officials play down any delay by noting that prolonged jockeying for foreign policy posts is not new to mr clinton s administration but in the two months since ms albright became secretary , the president has announced only two members of her team thomas r pickering , another respected career diplomat who retired from the foreign service last year , as under secretary of state for political affairs , and stuart e eizenstat , who was domestic policy adviser to president carter and is now an under secretary of commerce , as under secretary of state for economic affairs but at least a dozen more of ms albright s choices were sent to the white house for approval more than a month ago and remain in the vetting process , white house and state department officials said among them , the officials said , is ms albright s choice to be under secretary of state for management , bonnie r cohen , who is now serving as an assistant secretary at the interior department ms albright has also tapped a number of assistant secretaries , including susan rice , a national security council director , for african affairs

james f collins , the state department s special adviser for the former nations of the soviet union , to russia , and john kornblum , the assistant secretary for canadian and european affairs , to germany none of these appointees appear to be in danger , but in washington s hyperpartisan mood these days , the white house is taking nothing for granted people are very careful right now in ways that they have n't been in the past , a white house official said
the detroit newspaper strike that ended last week has been called the strike to end all newspaper strikes as many as 2 , 000 people are out of work because of it , careers were cut short or shunted on to new , less gratifying paths , homes were forced onto the market , any sense of community and solidarity among journalists there was shattered , and for what \? ten days ago , the strikers offered to go back to work , and not even under the terms of their old contract , but under the more restrictive staffing and benefits rules the management adopted during the 19month walkout even so , many of those workers will not get their jobs back , at least not right away , because management , which used replacement workers to publish during the strike , said it would hire the strikers back only as opportunities arise dozens of newspaper labor contracts have expired since 2 , 500 reporters , editors , drivers , pressmen , mailers and others walked out of the detroit free press and the detroit news in july 1995 nowhere else are many union men and women talking about taking a walk to speed up negotiations the detroit strike came at the end of the third wave of newspaper strikes , said robert g picard , chairman of the department of communications at california state university in fullerton , a wave that included the bitter strike at the daily news in new york in 1990 and the walkout at the pittsburgh press and the pittsburgh postgazette in 1992 that resulted in the closing of the press in all three cases , the unions struck to try to hang on to laborfriendly contract terms that management had agreed to a few decades before , at the time of the second phase of strikes at that time , in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s , new technology had started to make a variety of jobs typesetters , mail room newspaper assemblers and bundlers , for example redundant in 1962 local 6 of the international typographical union shut down new york city s newspaper industry over the new technology that would rapidly replace skilled , highly paid typesetters with a machine that spit out ribbons of cameraready newspaper columns but times were flush and most newspapers were still owned by wealthy , publicminded families as a kind of community trust in exchange for peace with the unions , which had largely formed during the first wave of strikes , in the 1930 s , management provided concessions called job security measures by the unions and featherbedding by the employers in the form of restrictive and often lucrative work rules there s no question in the world that a lot of papers were overstaffed no question , professor picard said featherbedding sounds bad these days , but it amounted to another way of making a buyout , except that you pay them over a long period instead of all at once and do n't forget , management signed the contract they made a deal thirty years later , management at some newspapers no longer liked the deal the industry was not as rich as it once was , and newspaper chains , driven by bottomlineoriented professionals , were offended by rules that , taking new york city newspaper wholesale drivers for example , allowed a worker with a 40 , 000 base salary to be paid 80 , 000 a year through rulerequired overtime enough , management said at some papers , including the new york times , unions and management agreed to voluntary buyouts , costing the papers millions of dollars in the short term but preserving labor peace and saving money in the long term detroit newspapers inc , the joint business and production arm of the free press and the news , also made what it called a goodfaith offer of voluntary buyouts but the unions , led by the teamsters , who controlled the papers' distribution , were wary of the offer , perhaps in part because it would deplete union membership the resulting strike may have been lost by the unions the moment management , with elaborate planning and a private security force in place , decided to continue to publish given detroit s brawny labor history , this was easily the nastiest of the modern newspaper strikes time and again , management complained to the national labor relations board that strikers were damaging delivery trucks , wrecking newspaper boxes and harassing the replacement workers and management sometimes displayed a swaggering attitude that was present in the daily news strike but largely absent in pittsburgh twice the work , half the people , none of the whining , a sign in one of the newspaper s newsrooms reportedly said at a newspaper conference this winter , according to the trade weekly editor publisher , the head of security for detroit newspapers used a vulgar spanish anatomical term to describe the ability of frank vega , the company s head , to resist the strikers' unavailing efforts to block publication so the unions , which are pursuing a case against detroit newspapers through the national labor relations board , lost the longest modern newspaper strike but knightridder inc , owner of the free press , and the gannett company , owner of the news , also lost tens of millions of dollars , and , some people believe , may have put the survival of the smaller news in jeopardy with the end of the strike , professor picard said , the legacy of the generous labor settlements of 30 and 40 years ago is also at an end this is the last setting where you have a bigcity paper and the kind of labor structure that produced this strike , he said there may be some little actions here and there , but this one scared the unions too much , and it scared the owners , too
it could have been the hot dogs they ate for lunch or the stuffed shells or perhaps the chocolate milk whatever it was , more than a dozen students in a bronx fourthgrade class became sick to their stomachs yesterday and had to be taken by ambulance to hospitals as of early last evening , investigators from the city department of health had not fixed on a culprit but doctors at bronx lebanon hospital , where eight of the children were treated and then released , concluded that they were suffering from mild food poisoning , lisa garcia , a hospital spokeswoman , said the students , who attend public school 79 at the corner of 181st street and creston avenue in university heights , went to lunch together just after noon , karen crowe , a board of education spokeswoman , said and all ate the lunch being served by the school hot dogs , rotini with vegetables , stuffed shells and chocolate milk soon after finishing lunch , 18 of the students began clutching their stomachs in pain , some of them gagging , others vomiting , ms crowe said while some became sick in the cafeteria , others were not sick until a halfhour later , after they returned to their classroom all but three were taken to hospitals the meals were prepared by the office of school food and nutrition services , a board of education division that serves 800 , 000 meals a day and was the subject of a 15month investigation two years ago in that inquiry , edward f stancick , the special commissioner of investigation for the city schools , concluded that food service officials had allowed cartons of beef , chicken and turkey to be stored months past their expiration dates the meat became rancid , but school officials said none of it was ever served in school cafeterias in yesterday s incident , nearly 1 , 000 students at ps 79 ate the schoolsupplied lunch , ms crowe said she could not explain why only those in one class were sickened , other than they went through the lunch line at the same time one of the fourthgraders sickened yesterday , kelvin ortiz , 10 , said he was stricken before he had finished eating in an interview at the emergency room at lincoln hospital yesterday afternoon , kelvin said he believed the chocolate milk was responsible he said he had stopped drinking it after only a few sips because it tasted salty and because he had noticed the expiration date was thursday s moments later , he said , he began vomiting as a hospital administrator translated his remarks from spanish to english , kelvin was asked whether he had been scared he smiled and said , no , but his stomach was sore four hours later fourteen of kelvin s classmates were taken to the hospital none were held overnight in an armada of ambulances that lined up outside the school , causing a ripple of panic among other students and parents in the neighborhood jessie figueroa , 28 , a parent who came to the school to pick up her son , who was not affected by the outbreak , said the scene had been frightening those kids were coming out in pain with tears in their eyes and holding their stomachs , like they were going to blow up , she said
grozny , russia , tuesday , jan 27 voters pushed and jostled in crowded polling places all over the secessionist republic of chechnya on monday with the kind of anxious zeal usually reserved for airport checkins and white sales at macy s for independence , of course , zarema amerkhanova , 22 , said when asked why she and so many others had shown up to vote in the southern village of shalazhi she was bobbing in a sea of people lining up to register and pick up their ballots this is incredibly important , she said these are our first democratic elections this is freedom after 21 months of devastating war with moscow s forces , chechens are in a hurry to pick a new president and speed on with the moment of reckoning they are racing down an almost inevitable collision course with moscow russia , which withdrew its last troops in december , still maintains that chechnya must remain a part of russia and stipulated in a peace treaty signed in august that the issue of sovereignty should be delayed five years but all 13 candidates favor independence from russia even the candidate considered most moderate the frontrunner , aslan maskhadov , 45 , chief of staff of the chechen forces in the war and the leader who signed the peace treaty now says independence cannot wait that long voters were not choosing between sovereignty and fealty , but rather a style of leadership the two leading candidates , mr maskhadov and shamil basayev , 32 , the rebel commander who led the daring , deadly hostage raid in budyonnovsk in southern russia in june 1995 , share the same goal but mr basayev , considered a terrorist in russia , is viewed here as more brazen and intransigent he is the candidate most likely to affront and enrage moscow some voters , particularly among the young , like that basayev , he s a mujik , said loma dudurkayev , 20 , using the russian expression for real man he said he could not vote for mr maskhadov because the russians like him too much mr maskhadov , who late in the campaign tried to shake the image that he is too congenial to moscow , would vigorously object but many voters said they liked the fact that he could deal with the kremlin i wanted to vote for basayev , but i voted for maskhadov , said lazis vagayev , 30 , a teacher who is running in the parliamentary elections maskhadov has seen more of life , he s a better diplomat if basayev wins , it will allow russia to tell the world that he is a terrorist and that they wo n't deal with terrorists he added of course he is not a terrorist he s a great national hero with a third of the ballots counted today , mr maskhadov may well have a commanding enough lead to win in the first round , election officials said final results will not be available until the end of the day , they said if none of the five leading candidates win 51 percent of the vote on monday , a second round will be held in midfebruary mr vagayev , like many others , said he dreaded it there is enough danger today , he said we have to try to understand the risk of provocations or disorder before a second round i really hope it does n't happen security in the first round was the greatest concern of chechen officials foreigners working in chechnya have been abducted and held for ransom after six red cross workers were killed in their sleep last month , all western aid organizations pulled out of chechnya the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which has a mission in grozny , sent in an evaluation team after the killings before deciding to proceed with the monitoring of the vote and each of the 72 observers of the security organization who fanned out across nearly half of the republic s 437 voting places on monday were accompanied by armed guards medical teams were put on alert

international observers also patrolled polling places , without bodyguards against a backdrop of urban ruin and desperate economic need , the central election commission registered 513 , 000 voters , including more than 60 , 000 refugees who were allowed to vote in polling places on the borders of the neighboring republics of ingushetia and dagestan after voters cast their ballots , their hands were stamped with special ink that can be read by infrared light , a device given by the security organization to all polling places to prevent people from voting more than once the organization has spent more than 600 , 000 to bring in observers and assist the chechen election commission after the polls closed , more than two dozen local election committee members , candidates' representatives and security guards from polling station no 6 solemnly boarded a bus carrying the sealed presidential ballot box to the district headquarters to be counted there , as an observer from the security organization looked on , the men and women painstakingly counted and recounted the votes , while the local chairman kept reminding them to keep the ballots clean overcrowding , not security , turned out to be officials' biggest headache at 2 pm the chechen central election committee in grozny decided to keep polling places open an extra two hours , to 10 pm , to insure that all voters would get a chance to vote if we had known there would be such a crowd , we would have divided people into groups , anzor amerkhanov , 24 , chief of police of the village of shalazhi , said as he stared wideeyed at the milling throng we were n't expecting it frankly , i did n't think people would be so disciplined photo a chechen exhorted residents of the village of vedeno to cast ballots yesterday polling

albany , july 29 gov george e pataki and leaders of the state legislature announced a tentative agreement tonight on a budget of nearly 68 billion that includes billions of dollars for new school programs and school construction , billions more for property tax relief , and a statefinanced cut in the new york city income tax after setting a record for lateness 120 days past the deadline the lawmakers emerged from the governor s office with a handshake agreement on a budget that reflects a surge in tax revenues , largely driven by wall street and not seen since the heady days of the mid1980 s the accord cuts taxes on property , on estates , on utilities and on clothing and increases spending on school construction and education programs for the early grades it also includes a 24 billion bond act on the november ballot for school construction and has none of the deep cuts in medicaid and higher education that mr pataki proposed at the start of the year it includes a compromise on one of the most contentious issues in the budget prison construction the leaders agreed to build a new 750cell prison and add 800 more cells to existing prisons i'm very pleased to announce that we are done , mr pataki said the budget is agreed to we are going to continue leading this nation in progressing in all the right areas the budget , 5 percent larger than last year s and nearly 2 billion more than mr pataki proposed in january , is a sharp turnaround from his administration s first two years , when he struggled to rein in expenses and make inroads in the state s structural deficit , the chronic tendency of expenses to outstrip income the agreements on tax cuts and school spending will not produce noticeable changes in the 199798 fiscal year , but they lock the state into spending more and more money in those areas over the next five years , which will present a challenge to budget writers in the future the budget does , at the governor s insistence , set aside 530 million as a reserve to make balancing next year s budget easier but independent budget monitors criticized the agreement , saying that the tax cuts and spending increases would create huge deficits in a few years if any of our leaders were fiscally responsible , they would renege on the deal , said cynthia b green , vice president of the citizens budget commission , a nonprofit group that closely monitors the city and state budgets mr pataki and the legislative leaders brushed aside such concerns and chose to focus on the tax cuts and increases in school spending the bond act would help repair hundreds of dilapidated schools , mostly in new york city , and build new ones in addition , the governor , assembly speaker sheldon silver and the senate majority leader , joseph l bruno , made a fiveyear commitment , which would be worth 15 billion a year when fully in effect , to lowering elementary school class sizes , providing prekindergarten classes for all 4yearolds and a host of other education programs it s been a long , hard fight , said mr silver , a manhattan democrat , who pushed for the education package the budget deal , he said , contains historic investments in our childrens' future there was ample room for all sides to claim victory mr bruno , a rensselaer county republican , said , the announcement that is made tonight will represent for the people of this state the largest tax cut in the history of new york state all the tax cuts , when fully in effect , would save new yorkers 5 billion a year , or about 270 a person the budget provides for broad property tax cuts , phased in from 1998 to 2002 , worth 22 billion a year essentially , the state will be paying local school districts to cap or lower the real estate taxes they charge homeowners will not see any of the cuts this fiscal year they will see the first benefits in tax bills sent in august and september of 1998 , just as mr pataki and other lawmakers are campaigning for reelection to counter complaints that new york city residents , who pay relatively little in direct property taxes , would receive little of the benefit from the tax relief package , the state will pay for a reduction in the city s income tax , worth 464 million a year or about 62 per person when fully in effect in 200102 the budget also includes a 30 percent reduction , worth 440 million a year , in the tax on utilities , which is passed on to customers this cut will be phased in over five years and there will be reductions in estate taxes , also to be phased in over five years , worth 400 million a year the agreement eliminates the 4 percent state sales tax on clothing , up to 100 in price for each article , beginning in december 1999 mayor rudolph w giuliani had lobbied hard for this cut , and wanted to see it go into effect this year instead , the leaders agreed to two taxfree weeks for clothes like the one tried earlier this year , this september and again in september 1998 when the state tax on clothes is eliminated , local governments , which generally assess their own 4 percent sales taxes , will be allowed to follow the state s lead and exempt clothing
pete carroll was named coach of the new england patriots yesterday and announced himself not as a cook who must purchase the groceries but as a relationship kind of guy who does n't mind pushing the cart the way he does for his wife not far from foxboro , in a downtown boston hotel , stu jackson of the vancouver grizzlies considered the question and said he would rather do the shopping and let someone else serve the beef these men one inheriting a super bowl football team the other trying to stop the bleeding on the worst team in professional basketball were , in effect , agreeing that two jobs require two people not necessarily one named bill and the other named parcells everybody you talk to says , 'get all the control you can , ' carroll said during his news conference he mentioned that there had been lesser teams that might have given him personnel power , but he preferred to sit tight , wait for parcells s expected exit , land a job with a team on the cusp of something great my job is to fit in , carroll said , alongside a the smiling owner robert k kraft be on the same page , part of an organization with a plan back at copley square , jackson was insisting that he has no scheme to retain the position of grizzlies coach he gave himself 10 days ago upon dismissing brian winters , no desire to be the doitall coach of the nineties i'm interim until the end of the season , said jackson , the grizzlies' president and general manager i harbor no illusions about being a coach and a frontoffice guy because i do n't know how you balance that jackson was once named coach of the knicks after rick pitino s eyepoking contest with general manager al bianchi ended predictably with the highstrung coach fleeing south to kentucky pitino versus bianchi parcells versus george young the recycled names may change but the tiresome stories of controlfreak coaches never do if only they could just go about their business of being brilliant from the time i coached the knicks , i know that preparing for games on a daily basis , dealing with the players , the media , the fans , makes it extremely difficult to worry about anything else , jackson said organizations need a chain of command because as coach and i'm speaking from experience your main concern every day is getting a win and that s all you think about jackson s secondyear expansionists , without a victory in his first four games on the bench , finally broke through sunday night in boston against a team run and coached , nonetooproductively , by one man , m l carr tonight s opponents for the grizzlies are the nets at continental arena , where the all purpose savior john calipari occasionally sounds like a frontoffice guy , most times whines like a coach and always looks like he wished he had stayed at u mass instead of graduating to a mess nets , of course , rhymes with jets , the first team to jettison its head of the family coach this season and as of yesterday the last team stuck if only temporarily with a vacancy say what you will about how kraft has handled the parcells affair , but he has moved fast , efficiently , and yesterday held his new coach s signed contract in one hand and a hammer in the other the jets , meanwhile , were still grasping at air , like some 300pound offensive tackle chasing a bouncing football near his goal line , panting to turn their front office over to a man who could n't manage his way out of his own contract carroll , onetime coach for the basement tenants at giants stadium , who got lucky and was fired , emerged from the protective cocoon of the san francisco 49er staff with a fiveyear contract if the jets could finagle a compensation deal with kraft without surrendering their no 1 pick , then they would have the man with two super bowl rings , but that would not necessarily mean they would automatically have carved out a new identity and scripted a longterm plan play in the giants' house , sign their brokendown players , try to hand over the keys to their former coach it s worth noting that not one team in the four major professional sports reached a championship game this year by going with a savior instead of a system but then , teams with as little sense as the jets do n't necessarily shop they look for a fastfood fix
there are more than 1 , 000 film festivals every year , but only a small number are truly important cannes is still the most highly regarded , followed in europe by venice and berlin but at least four north american festivals have international significance what these four festivals offer are different approaches for different people , said bingham ray , who handles acquisitions for october films with his partner , amir malin they have each been around for so long because they have been positioned strategically , both in the calendar and in the films they show here are the four the figures are from last year sundance film festival founded 1978 dates 10 days in january films 120 prizes 10 attendance 75 , 000 tickets sold press 500 hot films in 1996 shine , big night , the spitfire grill robert redford s sundance institute took over the already existing united states film festival in park city , utah , as a way to promote american independent films since 1989 , when steven soderbergh s sex , lies and videotape surfaced here , the festival has become the place to make discoveries sundance has evolved into an industryfocused event , said tony safford , once the program director at sundance and now senior vice president for acquisitions and production of 20th century fox it s a crucial way to find new films and film makers toronto international film festival founded 1976 dates 10 days in september films 300 prizes 5 attendance 250 , 000 tickets sold press 700 hot films in 1996 mother , kissed large and well run , toronto seems to generate the most good will within the industry not only can executives see a wide range of movies , but there is a considerable audience to test films on at toronto you can catch up on what you missed at cannes and venice , said mike maggiore , who programs movies at film forum in new york toronto is onestop shopping telluride film festival founded 1974 dates labor day weekend films 60 prizes none attendance 5 , 000 tickets sold press 100 hot film in 1996 swingers this small festival , set in a colorado valley , does not issue press passes or release its program until opening day and insists that film makers accompany their work as a result , it has become known as a place for purists even though little business is done at the festival , having a film selected for it is considered an honor telluride is not so much an industry festival , said jonathan weisgal , executive vice president of fine line features , but it does give a film an almost academic credit new york film festival founded 1963 dates 17 days in september and october films 60 prizes none attendance 50 , 000 tickets sold press 300 hot film in 1996 the people vs larry flynt unlike sundance , whose films are often subsequently released in a slightly different form , the films in new york are polished , because new york is where the movies are reviewed by the major critics any movie that gets rave reviews in new york will surely get to a national distributor , said the critic and author molly haskell in addition , the film society of lincoln center , which runs the new york festival , cooperates with the museum of modern art to present the new directors new films series , which is new york s homegrown version of sundance without the skiing , the glamour or the cellular phones new directors will take place this year in march and april edward lewine
port st lucie , fla , feb 17 there is no question that the yankees' mariano rivera put the setup spot on the map more than any bullpen artist of his era did but stoppers like john franco do not need a reminder of how valuable setup men like rivera can be for seven years on the mets , franco has rarely had the equivalent of a rivera alejandro pena came close , but his time at shea stadium was fleeting mostly though , the mets handed out the role only to watch legions fail now the mets and franco hope that sad piece of recent history is over greg mcmichael , the reliever acquired from atlanta for pitcher paul byrd in november , is here and expectations are high it s the first time in a long time we have a guy here who knows that job , franco said with greg out there , it s going to add depth we 'll have another veteran guy out there besides myself and it should help the mets have to hope that should help is the understatement of the spring their bullpen tied for 26th worst in the majors with 24 blown saves \( only 8 by franco \) and 17 of the club s 91 losses came in games in which the mets were either leading or tied after the seventh inning , a mark that general manager joe mcilvaine thought was much worse we were a good , competitive team for five innings , but we lost a majority of games in the sixth , seventh and eighth innings , said mcilvaine , who after the season made it a priority to blow up the bullpen mcilvaine did , keeping only franco and the stopperinwaiting derek wallace so mcmichael is only one of many new faces filling out a relief corps that now also includes the former phillies toby borland and ricardo jordan mcmichael , the pitcher in whom the mets have already invested 3275 million in a twoyear contract , should be the most intriguing simply because of his potential to give the mets the setup man they crave he brings a good track record his experience on a championship team , manager bobby valentine said of mcmichael , whose teams in the majors and minors made the playoffs eight of nine years and most of his experience has been in games they 've been winning and that s good experience , to know what to do when the team is ahead the 30yearold mcmichael knows of the expectations and hopes that accompanied him into mets camp he knows what rivera was able to accomplish in front of john wetteland and how it made an indelible impression on new york fans a year ago none of that , he vows , will shake him i'm not going to compare myself to anybody because i think that the things i 've done for the last four years speak for themselves , said mcmichael , who ended his braves career with an 1814 record and a 289 earned run average his 44 saves , in 265 consecutive relief appearances , rank fifth in franchise history so for me , my only goal is to be the best that greg mcmichael can be you ca n't help but be compared , but if you start worrying about that kind of stuff , you 're not going to be able to perform last year as the setup man for mark wohlers , mcmichael was 53 with two saves and a 322 earned run average he tied for eighth in the national league with 73 appearances he held righthanded hitters to a 212 batting average i hated facing him , said carl everett , a switchhitting outfielder for the mets that funky delivery , everything looks like a changeup for john smoltz , mcmichael s pitches were only part of the picture the 1996 cy young award winner said earlier this month that mcmichael is the one player whose presence will be missed most by the braves that , everett said , is another aspect that can only help the offense had veterans last year to look to , the outfielder said on the pitching side , though , everyone was real young so it s good to get more veterans and show the young guys a little more leadership inside pitch the first shutdown of the spring because of injuries occurred monday morning juan acevedo was examined by dr david altchek , who determined that the righthander has a muscle strain in his right shoulder altchek , the team physician , told acevedo to back off a little it s the same stiffness he had this winter that it took five days of rest to make go away , valentine said valentine was also examined , and it was determined that he has a probable tear in his right shoulder valentine , who injured himself in a variety of ways catching a child who was falling last month , skiing , and trying to lift his computer will not have surgery he probably wo n't be able to throw batting practice for another two weeks valentine would not fuel speculation that paul wilson will need the whole season to recuperate from arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder maybe when we have an idea we 'll say something , the manager said alex ochoa reported monday , bringing the number of potential starting right fielders in camp early to three carl everett and jay payton , both invited to camp early because they are rehabilitating from injuries , have participated in workouts since saturday photo greg mcmichael , who had a 322 era and 53 record in 1996 for the atlanta braves , could help the mets as a setup man for john franco \( rick silva for the new york times

as a building boom supplants farms and open space on the east end , a new coalition of environmental , business and civic groups is promoting a 2 percent realestate transfer tax to preserve open lands influential realestate and builders' groups strongly oppose the proposal , complaining that it would unfairly penalize buyers the new coalition whose leaders include environmentalists , individual farmers , some builders and realestate and bank officials said the tax was urgently needed to enhance preservation programs that they contend are falling short officials in east hampton are moving to submit the tax to a vote in november the tax , which would apply to transactions of more than 250 , 000 for house sales and 100 , 000 for unimproved land , would finance measures like buying land and development rights the proposal would mean that a buyer paying 500 , 000 for a house would pay a transfer tax of 5 , 000 a buyer of a 1 million house would pay 15 , 000 the money would go to a fund in that town the tax , which would not apply to sales less than the thresholds , would be tailored to exempt transactions where land remains in agriculture supporters said the tax would be modeled after a similar tax on nantucket that they said had been successful in preserving that resort island the proponents said the tax would wrest benefit from a tide of development that threatens to rob the area of character , environmental and esthetic assets and rural ways of life the premise is that you capture the realestatemarket activity in each of the east end towns , so that if there is a hot market there will be more money available for preservation , said kevin mcdonald , vice president of the group for the south fork , an environmental group in bridgehampton mr mcdonald said the coalition estimated that it would cost 375 million to preserve significant areas of farms and open spaces that make up 35 percent of the total land area in the five towns in addition to east hampton , the towns include riverhead , southampton , southold and shelter island imposing the tax would require state permission and approval by a majority of local residents in townbytown referendums last week , in a major advance for the tax , the east hampton town board requested state permission for a referendum supervisor catherine h lester said she expected broad support from voters who had backed other preservation programs onethird of the land in the town is protected , mrs lester said , adding , right now , with the building boom on the east end , it s more critical than ever to take steps to maintain our character money from the transfer tax would protect our open space , drinking water , harbors , bays and farmlands , she added state senator kenneth p lavalle , republican of port jefferson , said he was introducing a bill in albany that would authorize the referendum in east hampton a companion bill is to be introduced in the assembly with backing from fred w thiele jr , republican of sag harbor , and thomas p dinapoli , democrat of thomaston mr lavalle said if east hampton approved the tax that could be a model for other east end towns , none of which have requested permission for a referendum we chose east hampton because we had the greatest support there from government , realestate and development people , mr lavalle said the other towns need to go through a longer gestation period but east hampton seemed poised to go ahead the long island builders institute , the long island board of realtors and their statewide parent organizations have pledged to fight the bills officials of the groups said that the tax could spread to other parts of the state and country and that it might finance programs other than preservation the executive director of the long island builders institute , robert a wieboldt , said the tax was an admission fee charged to new buyers , at no cost to landowners or residents it s so easy to pass something like this , mr wieboldt said you are taxing people that are n't there yet mr wieboldt said programs that transferred development rights from areas to be preserved to areas that would be developed more intensively had proved successful in preserving 45 , 000 acres in montgomery county , md , where he recently took coalition members on a tour he said transferring development rights , already in use on the east end , was a way to preserve space without taxes or public spending mr mcdonald , who went to montgomery county , said it was disingenuous to suggest that the transfer of rights was a solution we are headed for suburbia with a few spots of open space in between , he said and the people who are opposed to measures like the transfer tax know that , and they are content to let it happen in southampton , where development has been the most rapid , supervisor vincent j cannuscio , a republican , said he would decide soon whether to support the tax i will probably come down on the side of supporting it , but with certain limitations , said mr cannuscio , adding that they included a time limit on the tax or provisions that it would be suspended if the market cooled
wide receiver anthony miller , a new addition to what may be the best offense in football right now , was talking recently about how well the dallas cowboys' offense is working he suddenly switched topics and went into a somewhat startling diatribe about negative comments he says denver broncos coach mike shanahan has been making about him i came to dallas to play and have fun , miller said and i guess because of the way shanahan is badmouthing me to people back in denver and around the league that i have to restore my reputation shanahan is telling everyone that i'm a bad guy , but he s the bad guy for saying the things he says about me i still talk to a lot of my friends on the broncos and they tell me he is saying i was this horrible person well , a lot of those guys are upset about it because they know me i guess shanahan is saying these things to justify losing me , but a lot of players in denver do n't like what is going on when asked what exactly was being said about him , miller said , he is saying i'm a bad character guy , but those are just lies you ask anyone in this locker room if i'm a bad guy , said miller , waving his arms i have done nothing but work hard and be a complete professional he s trying to destroy my character for no reason at all by telling lies about me where is all of this coming from \? there were definitely problems between miller and quarterback john elway last year and that strain may now somehow involve shanahan earlier this summer , miller was asked what was the difference between elway and troy aikman and miller said aikman has three super bowl rings and elway has none in the october issue of inside sports magazine , elway responded to miller by saying that while teams feared miller s speed the broncos never got any big plays out of him elway said that last season miller was selfish and did n't care about winning he added when you 're the no 1 offense in the league and you 're 133 and you have home field clinched and you 've got a guy complaining about getting the ball , that s a problem that shows what anthony miller is all about miller s remarks , made during an interview with the new york times , prompted shanahan to call him , and the two spoke late friday shanahan said he felt pretty good about our conversation shanahan , clearly puzzled by the remarks , explained that he had actually called the cowboys' owner , jerry jones , in the off season when dallas was pursuing miller , and he gave the receiver a good recommendation this is miller s 10th season in the national football league , and he is a fivetime pro bowl selection miller joined the broncos in 1994 as a free agent from san diego , and that season he had 60 catches for 1 , 107 yards and 5 touchdowns to become only the fourth bronco to pass the 1 , 000yardreceiving barrier miller , a high school and college track star who once finished second in the nfl s fastest man competition , is what the cowboys have been looking for as he will take the heat off michael irvin it will take some time for miller and quarterback troy aikman to get their timing down the two misfired on several attempts last week against pittsburgh miller also had problems at first with his timing with elway but miller is out to prove the broncos were wrong in letting him go , and so far he is off to a good start it is possible that the cowboys and the broncos could meet in the super bowl imagine then just how fired up miller would be the 49ers' falling fortunes the san francisco 49ers have a new fight on their hands they are usually gunning for dominance in the national conference , but now they just want to stay competitive with the st louis rams in their division the 49ers trying stay competitive with the rams \? in the name of joe montana , what s going on here \? injuries , that s what the future hall of fame receiver jerry rice tore ligaments in his knee that will very likely put him out for the season but perhaps even scarier is what happened to quarterback steve young , who received his third concussion in 10 months after he received a knee to the head against tampa bay the backup jim druckenmiller , a rookie from virginia tech , gets the start today against the rams in st louis young is one of the most competitive players in the league , and while that is indeed honorable when it comes to concussions , that drive to stay on the field at all costs can be dangerous has young learned from this experience \? denial has been a part of his life , said leigh steinberg , the quarterback s agent from pop warner football to the nfl , it is drilled into the heads of players , 'real men play with pain' but finally , with steve , i think his denial has been punctured steinberg has sponsored seminars to study the effects of head injuries on players he feels the league does not take the issue seriously enough it is a horrendous thought , steinberg said , but it might take someone to die on the field before the league takes this issue seriously what would steinberg do to try and cut down on these injuries \? based on his interviews with specialists and players , he said the nfl should eliminate the artificial surface , which is less forgiving than grass when the head hits the ground stop allowing the quarterback to get hit after he delivers the ball have a neurologist on the sideline at all times during a game we talked with the 49ers about having one on the sidelines during a game and they were not willing , steinberg said if they do n't want to pay for it , i will improve the helmets so they provide more protection there are more sophisticated ways to test brain functions than holding up two fingers and asking how many there are to a player with a concussion steinberg s advice is to use them the league has a curiously ambivalent point of view when it comes to concussions , steinberg said the symbol on 'monday night football' is two helmets colliding in an explosion , he said , adding that bit of symbolism shows what a dangerous game the nfl is playing i guess the bottom line is we need real changes , steinberg said , and we need them now in steve s case , if he has one more concussion , there is going to be a serious discussion about retirement i mean , very serious staying healthy , the favre way why does it seem that green bay quarterback brett favre is able to stay so injuryfree despite being one of the most wanted quarterbacks in the nfl \? it is because of something he does that is very smart and defensive lineman are beginning to notice most quarterbacks , after throwing the ball , stay in the pocket and brace for a hit they get pounded because they are stationary targets favre has developed a technique that has frustrated some defensive linemen because they ca n't get a good shot at him after throwing the ball , favre pedals out of the pocket fast that way , he is hit less he throws the ball and then rockets out of there , said giants defensive end michael strahan , who actually got a rare sack of favre in an exhibition game that s why he rarely gets hit after he lets go of the ball the way a lot of quarterbacks do it s pretty smart , actually more quarterbacks should do it photo david meggett being chased by mike horan , the giants' punter , during a return for a touchdown last season \( jose r lopez the new york times \)
baltimore , aug 31 the trade that steve phillips announced after the mets defeated the orioles , 41 , today is virtually meaningless , in terms of what he gave up and what he received phillips , the mets' general manager , sent a pitcher with no victories to milwaukee for a class a outfielder batting 223 but the pitcher s name is pete harnisch , who leaves the mets firing verbal shots at manager bobby valentine some that he delivered in person saturday night , others that he generated today from his home in new jersey harnisch said he had no respect for valentine , and that the manager demonstrated little empathy for harnisch when the pitcher began suffering from depression early in the season on saturday night , valentine called harnisch s criticism the end of a very frustrating period for the pitcher after today s game , the manager seemed relieved to be able to discuss baseball the solid pitching of rick reed , who allowed baltimore only four hits and a run over seven innings , and how the mets won two of three games from the team with the best record in the majors bernard gilkey , batting 565 over his last six games , hit a solo homer in the first inning , and butch huskey hit a tworun homer two innings later taking two of three from these guys is saying a lot , reed said in return for harnisch , the mets received a 21yearold outfielder , donnie moore , and will assume almost every dime of the about 500 , 000 still owed to harnisch the trade was inevitable after saturday s events soon after harnisch shouted profanely at valentine saturday in a lounge at the hotel where the team is staying with 20 to 30 people around them , according to a witness the 30yearold pitcher called wfan radio and severely criticized his manager there s not really a guy on this team that respects bobby valentine , said harnisch , who also lashed out at valentine s staff , in particular the pitching coach , bob apodaca today , none of harnisch s former teammates who were asked agreed with his assessment i ca n't back him on that , said catcher todd hundley , who recently had a public spat with his manager over valentine s criticism of his sleeping habits i respect bobby and the staff huskey said i can only speak for myself , but i have a better relationship with him than any manager i 've had i have no communication problems with him i love playing for him not that dallas green was a bad guy he was n't but i played for bobby in the minors carl everett said he s the only manager i ever had who listened to me i have n't had any problems pete was n't talking for me i feel bad for him i wish it would 've worked out better for him john franco , among harnisch s closest friends , avoided the fray that s his opinion , franco said that s between pete and bobby i'm not going to tell you if he was right or if he was wrong it does n't concern me gilkey said of harnisch s criticism i do n't see it i do n't know , though bobby s doing a good job putting my name in the lineup he has n't done everything right , but he has n't done everything wrong , either the team has turned around from last year evidently something is going right gilkey s relationship with valentine is strong enough that this morning he walked into the manager s office , picked up a plastic fork and handed it to valentine a joking reference to harnisch s assertion that valentine speaks with a forked tongue i 've heard things about how he used to be , gilkey said but he respects me as a ballplayer , and i respect him as a manager today , harnisch said of his comments i said what all the veteran guys are saying i do n't expect them to say anything i had some guys saying they were glad i was saying what i said hundley strongly disagreed with harnisch s criticism of the coaching staff i like the staff a lot it s one of the best staffs i played for , he said they treat the veterans great , let us do what we need to do to get ready to play bob apodaca is the best pitching coach i 've been around and i 've ever seen he s been one of the best in the game taken off the team in a roster move after saturday s game , harnisch said nothing to valentine in the meeting with the manager and phillips , speaking only to the general manager talking with reporters right after , he sanitized his comments , indicating only that he was unhappy with , and had little respect for , valentine but at the team hotel later , valentine , meeting friends , encountered harnisch and his wife , donna according to valentine , donna harnisch indicated she was disappointed that he had not sent flowers or a card when harnisch was out with depression valentine answered that he was under orders from a physician treating harnisch not to contact the pitcher because it might be construed as pressure \( other mets players and executives said they , too , were under similar orders at the time \) harnisch , according to valentine , swore at him , calling him a liar and continued yelling there was not a yelling match , valentine said i never cursed i asked him to be quiet and to go in private , and he did n't want to do anything in private it was n't confrontational it was one person yelling i did n't send flowers or a card that s a fact maybe that was a mistake harnisch spoke saturday of an april meeting with valentine and apodaca in san francisco before harnisch was found to have depression in which he said valentine insinuated he was scared to pitch valentine vehemently denied this he maintained that he said almost nothing to harnisch because dr allan lans , a counselor working with the team , had told him to watch everything i say and do because harnisch was in an emotionally fragile state harnisch said valentine was contradicting himself with his many comments i do n't think i can think of anything lower than what i think about bobby valentine , he said every time he opens his mouth , he makes a jerk of himself photo bernard gilkey , left , greeting butch huskey

social security may not be getting a face lift this year , but the report from a federal advisory panel released monday insures that washington , for the first time in more than a decade , will be forced to look long and hard at what ails the giant public pension system a host of radically different proposals with radically varying effects on the economy , on the financial markets and on the incentives for americans to save for retirement are now on the table each of the plans to shift into private securities some of the money that social security now invests exclusively in government bonds would give a lift to the stock market but the effects would be modest , probably temporary and raise new questions about whether pensioners or taxpayers are prepared to absorb the consequences of market volatility shuffling the ownership of stocks between public and private hands redistributes risk , but not much else , said barry bosworth , an economist at the brookings institution indeed , those who see the partial privatization of social security and the subsequent flood of cash into private securities as a way to keep the good times rolling on wall street may be frustrated for one thing , nothing is likely to change in the immediate future for another , there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom that money going into 401 \( k \) s and other private pension accounts is the principal reason the market has experienced its stunning runup since the early 1980 s indeed , private savings have not , in fact , increased much in the last few years more plausibly , rising stock prices have been driven by the expectation that american business will continue to increase its profits in the future an expectation linked to low inflation and the lack of a recession in recent memory we really do n't know what would happen to securities prices if the stock market began to get social security money , said stephen ross , a specialist in finance at the yale school of management , but we do n't expect the impact would be large after all , the flows of new investment in stocks that could be expected if one of the plans was established would be large but not without parallel in the early going , each plan would be expected to generate new investment in stocks similar to the amounts now being contributed to 401 \( k \) plans each year about 69 billion in 1992 , the latest for which figures are available that is little more than the volume of new public offerings of stock , which was 59 billion last year once a plan is fully established , cash flowing from it into the stock market would resemble the amount investors are now putting into stock mutual funds each year in the first 11 months of 1996 , mutual funds that invest in american stocks took in 165 billion in net new money from investors none of the three plans outlined by the council would yield a similar volume of new investment until the year 2010 or later and by that time , inflation and a larger economy would dilute the impact of any additional flow of funds more significant , the plans could have a large and not entirely predictable effect on savings and growth increased savings , which yields increased wealth , lies at the core of politically and economically sustainable reform , argues carolyn weaver , director of pension studies at the american enterprise institute and one of the 13 members of the advisory council on social security that panel split into three factions over how to rescue social security from future bankruptcy in one sense the social security crisis is synthetic today , with payroll tax revenues far outpacing pension outlays , the government faces no imminent cash squeeze indeed , narrowly viewed as a pay as you go system , social security is viable for another two decades but seen through the lens of a future retiree , social security is wildly askew because the big baby boom generation is owed some 9 trillion more than following generations are obliged to pay in social security taxes and unless the economic pie grows far more rapidly than is now predicted , the only way to meet the system s obligations will be to transfer trillions in income throughout the 21st century from the young to those who will be old one plausible political solution is neglect indeed , pay as you go might well be rationalized as a way to focus limited political energies on more pressing budgetary problems in particular , the need to raise revenue or cut outlays for medicare and medicaid but delay means even more drastic change down the road in 2011 , projected outlays will equal payroll taxes collected at current rates in 2025 , however , the pay as you go deficit would reach 3 percent of national income forcing sharp tax increases or raising budget deficits while reducing national savings another idea , rejected by the panel but popular among many of those who want to preserve social security as it is , would be a payroll tax increase today that is large enough to pay for the boomers' retirement and beyond a 22percentagepoint increase would go a long way , explained peter diamond , an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology \( currently , workers and employers together pay 124 percent on salaries up to about 70 , 000 to finance social security \)
brindisi , italy smoking is such a part of italian life that consumption is not measured in cigarettes , packs or cartons , but in tons more than 25 , 000 tons last year and in a country where organized crime and smuggling are part of the landscape it is not surprising that a substantial portion of the cigarettes here nearly one in five , or 4 , 693 tons are contraband cigarette smuggling in italy has flourished for several reasons including an illfated decision in 1992 to ban the sale of marlboros after the authorities concluded that the philip morris companies , which makes the brand , had some complicity in the smuggling the ban led to a surge in smuggling before it was lifted still , smuggling continues because of high tobacco taxes and because italy has long tolerated street vendors hawking contraband cigarettes two criminal cases provide some unusual detail of how smuggling operates in italy in one broad racketeering case that is on trial in this adriatic city , some 60 defendants are described in an arrest warrant as members of a mafialike association , which buys enormous quantities of cigarettes directly from the tobacco companies the criminal organizations sign contracts with the tobacco companies , and the criminals have so much economic power that they insist that the company not sell to any of the gang s competitors , according to an arrest warrant in the case in another case , augusto arcellaschi , who is described by law enforcement officials as one of europe s major cigarette smugglers , goes on trial in belgium this month on charges that he was involved in smuggling a billion marlboros from antwerp , belgium , through switzerland into italy over two months in 1993 , mr arcellaschi smuggled 113 truckloads of marlboros to italy each truck held 10 million cigarettes according to the formal charges against him mr arcellaschi has been smuggling marlboros into italy for more than a decade , according to criminal records in italy and investigators with the european union s antifraud unit philip morris , which makes marlboro , denied that it had sold cigarettes to mr arcellaschi or to any of the other individuals who have been charged mr arcellaschi declined to comment , and his lawyer , filippo ferrari , refused to discuss any of the accusations i absolutely have no comment , he said while philip morris says it does not knowingly sell to smugglers , it benefits from the trade marlboro s market share in italy jumps 15 points , to 70 percent , when contraband is included , italian officials said on the street , a pack of contraband marlboros sells for about a third less than a legal pack i am personally sure that they know the final destination of their cigarettes , nicola piacente , a prosecutor in the racketeering case here , said about philip morris and other tobacco companies but they have excuses and arguments that they do n't in fact , none of the companies have been charged with wrongdoing by mr piacente essentially , the companies say that they sell to middlemen and are not responsible for what happens with the cigarettes after that two organized criminal groups in italy take in more than 600 million a year from the illegal trade in cigarettes , said mr piacente , sitting in his office , one wall covered with plaques and photographs from australia , his desk piled with papers that just about engulfed a computer along with a colleague , cataldo motta , mr piacente has waged a relentless war against organized crime in italy as a result , when he plays tennis , goes to the movies , eats , even when he sleeps , bodyguards hover about evidence in the racketeering case that mr piacente is pursuing includes wiretaps in which a purchase of cigarettes from philip morris is discussed , according to official documents in one conversation monitored by the police , at 11 44 am on june 20 , 1993 , the warrant said , benito leo received a phone call from cosimo pupino , who informs him that he has just concluded a deal directly with philip morris to buy original 05 marlboro and merit both mr leo and mr pupino are defendants two weeks later , at 7 40 pm on july 3 , according to the warrant , mr leo received another call from mr pupino this time mr pupino reported that he had reached an accord with philip morris to buy 10 , 000 cases of original marlboro 05 at the price of 230 a case mr pupino said that he managed to get favorable conditions both for the price and for the terms of payment , but that the deal is conditioned on the payment of a security deposit to a bank account in switzerland get moving , this is a good deal , directly with philip morris , mr pupino told mr leo , according to the warrant philip morris denies that it ever sold cigarettes to mr pupino or mr leo neither of these men is or has been a customer of philip morris , or , to the best of our knowledge , a customer of any of our customers , said andre reiman , a senior vice president with philip morris europe , which is based in lausanne , switzerland as to mr arcellaschi , a decade ago , he was convicted in italy of smuggling more than 2 , 000 tons of cigarettes , mostly marlboros , into italy and he was sentenced to six years in jail after serving part of his sentence , mr arcellaschi moved to lugano , switzerland , where he still lives as long as he remains in switzerland , mr arcellaschi may be safe from prosecutors in italy or belgium because he is unlikely to be extradited there is no cooperation from switzerland on these matters , said mr piacente , the brindisi prosecutor in the racketeering case he said that he had not even been able to get the authorities in switzerland , where cigarette smuggling to avoid taxes is not a crime and where there are strict commercial secrecy laws , to provide a list of philip morris s units and clients operating in switzerland
toronto , jan 17 the commander of the canadian army said today that 47 soldiers in canada s peacekeeping mission to bosnia have been accused of drinking while on duty , having sexual relations with nurses and interpreters and physically abusing patients at a mental hospital in 1993 and early 1994 because the misconduct is said to have taken place more than three years ago , the commander , lieut gen maurice baril , said , a military statute of limitations excluded the soldiers from disciplinary actions by courtmartial but he said the cases would be investigated by a special career review board with the power to freeze the soldiers' ranks or force them out of the army earlier in the day , the army released a report of more than 7 , 000 pages that outlined how the canadian peacekeepers drank beer while they were guarding the mental hospital , west of sarajevo some soldiers were also charged with black market activities , and with breaking military rules by having sexual relations with civilians at the hospital the report denied charges that canadian soldiers had raped patients , and rejected accusations that canadians had refused to help a wounded serbian soldier the allegations against canadian peacekeeping troops are just the latest in a series of painful revelations of misconduct , the most damaging of which involved the killing of a somali teenager by canadian commandos in 1993 and later attempts by the military to cover up the incident such misconduct has forced canada to rethink not only its customary role in peacekeeping operations but the size , shape and discipline of a 65 , 000strong army whose military mission has shifted from national defense to peacekeeping it is clear , general baril told reporters in ottawa , that we need to do business in new ways the general blamed alcohol and a lack of leadership for many of the problems that have recently come to light an army is made up of people , the general said , and people make mistakes the conditions under which canadian troops served in bosnia stand in sharp contrast to what united states soldiers encountered there most of the soldiers from the united states were kept on posts and rarely allowed to venture into the surrounding communities alcohol was strictly prohibited the written report made public this morning recommends that alcohol be restricted on future missions , but general baril told reporters that drinking should be banned completely the problems in bosnia were first mentioned by army officers last july , but general baril said it was only during a subsequent investigation that details were uncovered he said that , in all , 57 canadian soldiers were involved , none of them senior officers ten of the 57 have already left the army , but based on the results of the investigations their discharge records could be changed to reflect the charges of misconduct the canadian unit had been praised in the past for protecting the bakovici hospital during some of the most savage fighting in bosnia in 1993 and 1994
beijing , march 18 china defused a fiveweek diplomatic crisis today by spiriting a senior north korean defector out of the country and sending him by special plane to the philippines , where he is expected to stay for a decent diplomatic interval before traveling to south korea the defector , hwang jang yop , an ideological mentor to kim jong il , the north korean leader , was the most senior member of his country s hardline elite ever to defect he arrived at the clark special economic zone , a former american military base in the philippines , just after noon aboard a china southern airlines boeing 737 that had carried him and three escorts from the south china port of xiamen what i can tell you is that through consultations among all sides , the problem has already been solved , a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry , cui tiankai , told reporters at a news conference this afternoon shortly after that , the official new china news agency reported that mr hwang left china today for a third country none of the governments involved in the arrangements for mr hwang s departure from china disclosed the conditions for his safe passage to south korea on monday , a senior south korean official said mr hwang would remain in a third country for a considerable period of time before going on to seoul that condition was presumably intended as a gesture to spare china the image of having its territory used as an escape route from north korea mr hwang , who is believed to be 74 , sought political asylum at the south korean consulate in beijing on feb 12 he was passing through the chinese capital on the way home from a conference in japan north korea initially accused south korean agents of kidnapping mr hwang and threatened unspecified retaliation fears that north korean intelligence agents would try to seize or kill the defector set off a sizable security alarm here and led to the deployment of chinese troops backed by armored personnel carriers to beijing s diplomatic quarter the highsecurity operation today ended five weeks of drama around the south korean consulate that served as mr hwang s sanctuary as diplomatic negotiations were carried out in several asian capitals to pave the way for his departure mr hwang s departure was a significant diplomatic victory for china , whose leaders were aghast at suddenly finding beijing a battleground in a highstakes struggle over a defector his intimate knowledge of the north korean leadership makes his desertion as embarrassing to the north as it is valued by the south and by those asian and western governments that will profit from the treasure of intelligence that mr hwang brings with him in managing the defection crisis , the goal of china s communist party leaders was to prevent violence in beijing as intelligence operatives from both koreas circled each other warily behind the police cordons that were thrown up to protect the south korean consulate but beijing also demonstrated that it has balanced its relations between its longstanding communist allies in the north and its newfound capitalist allies in south korea china said today that it had acted according to hwang s own will in aiding his departure , but had also taken into account the positions taken by the parties concerned and a desire to safeguard peace and stability on the korean peninsula after north korea s initial strong protests , its propaganda outlets fell silent as the standoff in beijing wore on , indicating that the north s leaders had become resigned to the fact that china was not going to hand over the defector mr hwang s arrival in the philippines was surrounded by the same secrecy as his departure from china , and government officials refused to confirm that he was there when asked mr hwang s whereabouts , foreign under secretary rodolfo severino insisted , i have no idea officials at the clark special economic zone confirmed that mr hwang had arrived there on a chartered chinese aircraft airport officials said south korean and philippine officials had met him but beyond that , his location was unclear there were no signs of unusual activity at the south korean embassy in manila like most other southeast asian countries , the philippines does not have diplomatic relations with north korea but relations between the two countries are friendly , and last year the philippines sent 20 , 000 in food and medical aid to north korea in seoul , south korea s foreign ministry spokesman , lee kyu hyung , said of mr hwang he is under our control with the cooperation of a third country , we have him staying in a secure and safe place mr lee reiterated that hwang jang yop himself wanted to defect , and the arrangements were made after negotiations with china , so i hope no new tensions will develop between south and north korea

it s been a better year than rockwell had a right to expect its older modem technologies sold well , a technological glitch with its newer ones was easily solved , and robust economies in europe and north america translated into great sales for its factory automation systems the barrage of small , sweet surprises pushed secondquarter earnings way above predictions wait a minute rockwell s earnings dependent on modem sales \? on economic fluctuations \? what s the maker of the b1 bomber doing in a commercial world like this \? hyperventilating , actually we 're in high profit businesses with a lot of flexibility , but we sure do n't have the buffers we once had , said donald r beall , the rockwell international corporation s chief executive they sure do n't late last year rockwell sold its 31 billion aerospace business to the boeing company , thus jettisoning its military work , with its moneyinthebank longterm contracts and rich cash flow , and its highgrowth commercial satellite business and mr beall says that come september , he will spin off rockwell s automotive business to shareholders , removing another 31 billion in revenues and rockwell s last vestige of predictability its remaining businesses semiconductors , automation and avionics have hitched their futures to the star of electronics , a star that , as apple computer inc has learned , can go nova as easily as it can shine they 're now depending on really volatile businesses for a huge part of their growth , said howard a rubel , an analyst at goldman , sachs company added lior bregman , an analyst with oppenheimer company , they can have a little booboo , and the quarter goes up in smoke the prospect does not seem to faze mr beall none of the businesses that make up the nearly 8 billion miniconglomerate that is the new rockwell are global leaders , but he insists they will be five years from now we 'll be twice our size , and a worldclass player in commercial electronics , he said making good on that promise will require a sea change unlike the space and military worlds , where safety and quality are prized above speed and cost , rockwell has entered a world where a day late and a dollar short is not a cliche , it is a recipe for bankruptcy mr beall insists rockwell is as nimble as any company , and some of his competitors and customers concede that for a defense contractor , it is but for an electronics player \? real speed and urgency are just not things you become proficient in overnight , warned iain morris , a vice president at motorola inc , which uses rockwell s modem chips rockwell is not new to any of its businesses its automation business revolves around allenbradley , which rockwell bought in 1985 , and much of its avionics business has grown out of collins radio , a 1973 acquisition it has made chip sets for modems for 20 years and its nonaerospace research investments have grown steadily , to 691 million last year from 571 million in 1994 but until now , these divisions were icing on a government contracting and automotive cake now , they and customers as disparate as makers of consumer packaging , airplanes and cellular telephones represent rockwell s future thus , each is seeking new ways to cut costs , grab market share and otherwise assume the role of nobleman , not serf european offices now must coordinate with the home office in seal beach , calif engineers now must develop components that can be used in several product lines people who only considered their own balance sheet now must take the whole company into account , said don h davis jr , rockwell s president nor is the trauma abating rockwell is adding new companies and thus , new cultures at a brisk pace , even as it digests reliance electric , the huge electric motor company it bought in 1995 it just bought brooktree , which makes modem chips , and is buying himedia , which makes boxes that link televisions to the internet and , with 700 million in cash and almost no debt , rockwell is still shopping we hold discussions all the time , is all mr beall would say such huge corporate reinventions are unusual in healthy companies like rockwell , whose bottom line has held firm for years \( rockwell closed friday at 6450 on the new york stock exchange , down 150 \) yet even before the last b1 bomber rolled off the line in 1988 , rockwell s board was talking about branching out we did n't plan to get out of aerospace entirely , but we wanted to be less dependent on government business , said william s sneath , a director since 1979 that feeling was underscored in the late 1980 s , when the government started pressuring contractors to shoulder precontract development costs you could spend 1 billion and still lose the bid , said charles h harff , who retired last year as rockwell s general counsel rockwell was not the only government contractor to grow leery some transferred their military technology to commercial products textron inc , for example , turned its aircraft compartment latches into quickrelease rollerblades , its guided missile motioncontrol system into a robotic gas pump , and so on

minneapolis , july 22 earlier this month , trucks pulled up to a warehouse here already swollen with cigarette company records and unloaded more than 200 , 000 documents that may represent the tobacco industry s bestkept secrets and its biggest vulnerability the new documents have been seen by only a handful of people who are legally barred from speaking about them but lawyers for the state of minnesota , which is suing the tobacco industry , claim that the documents , which have been disclosed to them only in summary form , contain evidence of a decadeslong conspiracy by cigarette makers and their lawyers to suppress evidence and deceive the public about the dangers of smoking in the wave of smokingrelated lawsuits filed by states in recent years , minnesota can claim two distinctions in the talks leading to last month s 3685 billion tobacco settlement proposal , its attorney general , hubert h humphrey 3d , emerged as the plan s principal opponent after losing that round , mr humphrey seized on a unique aspect of minnesota s case no other state has plumbed the padlocked files of the tobacco companies with such intensity and singlemindedness two weeks ago , mr humphrey , in an effort to influence the congressional debate over the proposal , urged the senate judiciary committee to subpoena key records from his state s case so that congress could review them as it considers turning the proposal into legislation i want congress to know the facts to the greatest extent possible before a bargain is made with the american people , mr humphrey said in an interview critics of mr humphrey , who is running for governor , see his proposal as little more than political grandstanding and a continuation of the obstructionist role that he played in the settlement talks but his suggestion has not fallen on deaf ears senator orrin g hatch of utah , the judiciary committee s ranking republican , and senator patrick j leahy of vermont , its ranking democrat , have said they want to see the most important minnesota documents and even those involved in crafting the plan , like stanley chesley , a classaction plaintiffs' lawyer , have recently scrambled to provide some 200 selected industry documents to committee members under the proposed settlement , cigarette companies would be required to disclose healthrelated documents except those that they claim involve trade secrets or are protected by attorneyclient privilege but the comments of mr humphrey have broadened the debate from criticisms of the recordsdisclosure provision to larger questions about which industry documents congress should have as it weighs the monetary value and public health benefits of the agreement recently , for example , senator leahy said he could not back a settlement that provided cigarette producers with immunity against punitive damages and classaction lawsuits , as the proposed settlement would , unless they reveal everything they know about their products' dangers i offer one simple and direct principle to guide us , senator leahy said at a recent judiciary committee hearing no immunity without full disclosure industry officials and others involved in the accord said demands for document disclosure are unrealistic tobacco companies , they said , must shield some documents because of future lawsuits and one industry lawyer said new documents suggesting deceptive activity by tobacco companies would not produce revelations but would only reinforce existing public opinion the bad stuff about the industry is already out there , said the lawyer , who insisted on anonymity whatever the case , the breadth of industry documents collected by lawyers for robins , kaplan , miller and ciresi , a firm here that represents the state and blue cross and blue shield of minnesota , is unrivaled in the history of tobacco litigation for example , in all previous smokingrelated lawsuits , the brown williamson tobacco corporation , a subsidiary of plc , produced about 5 , 000 records , said david bernick , a company lawyer but since the start of the minnesota case in 1994 , the cigarette maker has disclosed four million pages of documents after reviewing some 30 million pages of documents produced by all major tobacco companies , lawyers for the state eventually chose about 2 percent of those records to form the basis of their lawsuit , which seeks to recover billions of dollars in medicaid money spent treating smokingrelated illnesses the document collection also was used as part of the underpinning of similar medicaidrelated lawsuits filed by other states because of a court order in minnesota affecting the confidentiality of the industry documents , few of the records have been made public last year , lawyers for the state filed a nowpublicized document written in the early 1970 s by researchers for the r j reynolds tobacco company , which is owned by rjr nabisco holdings corporation it suggested that the popularity of the philip morris companies' marlboro brand was attributable to the company s manipulation of nicotine levels
the diamond project , a festival of new works that the new york city ballet does not call a festival , continues apace , and the third entry , circle of fifths , is a winner christopher d'amboise , a former principal in the company , who directed the pennsylvania ballet from 1990 to 1994 , has taken philip glass s 1987 concerto for violin and orchestra and choreographed an astringent puredance work full of surprises working in an alltoofamiliar style , descended from george balanchine s ballets to stravinsky s music \( notably symphony in three movements and agon \) , mr d'amboise nonetheless exhibits his own fierce originality the world premiere of circle of fifths on friday night at the new york state theater left many a blazing afterimage there was wendy whelan seemingly covering the diagonal of the entire stage in one jete or being tossed halfway across that stage back to a cluster of men in the rear there was peter boal , in what must be the most restful role since franz in coppelia gets to sleep through the entire second act after he is drugged by dr coppelius during the second movement of the glass concerto , mr boal lies on the floor while ms whelan and albert evans fit the angular lines of their bodies into the astonishingly inventive duet that makes circle of fifths so striking within its selfimposed conventions for essentially mr d'amboise has taken a risk kevin o 'day and angelin preljocaj , the choreographers who preceded him in this third diamond project \( the earlier series ran in 1992 and 1994 \) are not members of the city ballet like the three other choreographers still to come , mr d'amboise has absorbed the balanchine repertory in his bones as a dancer but as a secondgeneration city ballet member , he absorbed the tradition more deeply than most a little prince in the nutcracker , and a son of the city ballet dancers jacques d'amboise and carolyn george , he became a principal dancer in the company that is , he grew up without the need to question the value of ballet s classical idiom or its formal value circle of fifths is a plotless ballet that is about its movement , although the lighting , especially well designed by mark stanley , and the gorgeous metallic blue or green leotard tops by holly hynes , can contribute to an implied dramatic imagery in the choreography the literal beauty of the ballet reveals itself only in the duet , which becomes a trio , and this lies largely in mr d'amboise s play with structure choreographic motifs recur and acquire different meaning in a new context mr boal dives more than once to the floor , and he is not the only one to do so a phrase that ends with two dancers palm to palm looks fresh when it is part of an accelerated sequence the risk is that circle of fifths will look like so many other neobalanchine ballets in the master s contemporary style in those works to 20thcentury music , the academic vocabulary is the reference point but is just as often inverted and so the first movement of circle promises its own share of cliches feet are flexed as well as pointed , legs are held parallel as well as turned out but as the ballet progresses , a simple image of dancers bouncing up and down with legs held parallel takes on a creative edge toward the end , the three principals \( mr boal , ms whelan and mr evans \) and eight ensemble dancers \( cara copeland , michele gifford , pauline golbin , jennifer tinsley , stuart capps , james fayette , benjamin millepied and robert wersinger \) jump up and down in this position but also spread into different floor patterns here is reductive movement that translates mr glass s minimalism with appropriate flair the glass score is atypical , free of the expected chugging modular rhythms of the composer s theatrical works and recognizable as a violin concerto with classical antecedents with richard moredock conducting , guillermo figueroa brought mr glass s long melodic line into vibrant relief with his violin solos , especially in the second movement the first section introduces a standing group mr boal dives to the floor while mr evans and ms whelan begin some dolllike gestures that , frankly , do not promise much structure raises its head , however , when ms whelan does a more centered version of the weightshifting solo with which mr evans opened the ballet mr stanley bathes the stage in blue light , and there is an aquatic fluidity to the ensemble dancing , especially during the jagged fiddling that precedes the second movement here , the ballet shifts to a higher level as ms whelan and mr evans , dancing superbly , are seen in the equivalent of a closeup , a duet in an enlarged spotlight mr evans encloses his partner from behind or claps his hands overhead \( she and mr boal will do the same later \) torsos , wrists and ankles are rotated and there is a striking image when ms whelan bends down and swings her leg around like the hand of an invisible clock mr evans lies under her legs as she points her foot and yet none of this looks artificial when mr boal rises from his rest , he executes the same movements as mr evans at one point , the three principals seem to perform fragments of a composite sequence mr evans runs in a circle as the repeated bowing of the violin solo is heard against the background of the cellos the third section brings back the ensemble with four pairs prancing in emboite there are knockkneed shapes and plies but the ruling image is that of ms whelan in her flying leap across the stage mr d'amboise has magnified her normal energy what a dancer there were three balanchine ballets on the program kyra nichols repeated pavane and margaret tracey and a romantic nilas martins displayed the same line , dancing in harmony in allegro brillante helene alexopoulos , as a showgirl siren , seduced mr boal in prodigal son as the antihero he fused his country bumpkin portrayal with his heroic dancing praise is in order for michael byars and mr wersinger , both making something out of the thankless roles of the son s servants , once called friends

there are no restaurants like this in rio , say my brazilian friends , seating themselves in the warm and festive room that is circus nobody wants to go out to eat the food they cook at home the recent spate of churrascarias , where meat in copious quantities is the main thing , is giving us a very odd idea of brazilian cooking an entire generation now thinks the people of south america s largest nation sit down to vast amounts of steak and potatoes every night but while places like churrascaria plataforma faithfully reproduce a form of restaurant popular in brazil , circus serves the food your mother might cook if you were raised in sao paulo or bahia picadinho and muqueca de camarao might not have many takers in an upscale rio restaurant , but new york is a different story circus is usually packed with brazilians eager for a taste of home they jump up to embrace each time the door opens , gorgeous women in impossibly tight clothes and elegant men with a nonchalant air the charming circus drawings on the wall acrobats , prancing horses and adorable tigers add to the festive feeling this increases with the hour brazilians eat late , and as the night gets older , the restaurant takes on the air of a party brazilians speak portuguese with a soft accent , erasing the edges their food has the same quality it is easy to like the dominant ingredients \( other than beef \) are seafood , coconut , rice and beans , often combined in fascinating ways my favorite dish on the current menu is camarao na moranga , a heap of tiny , tender rock shrimp sauteed with fresh corn , hearts of palm , shallots , peas and coconut milk , mixed with cheese and baked in an acorn squash the squash becomes soft enough to eat with a spoon , adding its own note to the rich , elusive flavors , which change with each bite served with a side dish of rice , it is completely appealing i like picadinho , too , beef sauteed with wine and thyme , topped with a poached egg and accompanied by rice , beans and cooked bananas it tastes like earthy home cooking , and if it were only a little spicier it would be fabulous oh , say my friends shrugging , brazilians think americans do n't like salt and spice , so they tend to leave them out when they cook for you i certainly wish they would n't another particularly satisfying dish on the menu is an appetizer , bolo de milho e rabada , little polenta cakes baked with manchego cheese and served with a robust oxtail sauce a single large and meaty oxtail shares the plate the textures are soft , the flavors gentle this is just the sort of food that would be good to find on the table after a hard day at the office i like casquinha de siri , too , sauteed crab meat baked in a shell and topped with cheese and toasted farofa , the manioc flour that is found in almost every brazilian recipe and feijoada , brazil s famously meaty black bean stew , is worth a weekend trip circus serves it only on saturdays and sundays but circus has a tendency to prettify the food , making it fancier than it would normally be muqueca de camarao , a stew from the northeast of the country , is a delightful mush in its natural form , but here it becomes too elegant shrimp are grilled , fanned out around a mound of rice , embellished with a tomato , red pepper and coconut milk sauce , decorated with shreds of coconut and topped with a mere sprinkle of farofa the flavors are muted and the dish loses its authenticity salmon is another nouvelle creation the menu promises a sauce of shrimp and dende , the highly concentrated palm oil that is the true taste of the country i liked the fish fillet , neatly folded into a crust of shredded potatoes and set on a bed of cabbage , but i could not make out the forceful punch of dende by the time we got to frango com quiabo , chicken with okra and saffron sauce , i was starting to regret the kitchen s tendency to deconstruct plain food what might have been a tasty stew on a bed of mashed potatoes had turned into a finicky dish of chicken with a side dish of okra it was a disappointment another disappointment was that the caipirinhas , the national drink of brazil , are made with vodka instead of the more powerful cachaca , which makes them wimpy on the other hand , the unusual wine list concentrates on spain , portugal and argentina prices tend to be high for the less expensive wines , but there are some bargains among the older , bigticket bottles brazilian desserts are sweet and tropical circus executes them faithfully the passion fruit mousse is too sweet for me , but i love the caramelized bananas with ice cream and i like the soft coconut mousse with fresh coconut called maria mole , a classic children s dessert you finish , of course , with cafezinho , the potent little cups of coffee that fuel the country it reminds your mouth that you have just spent some time in brazil circus \( rating two stars \) 808 lexington avenue , near 62d street , manhattan , \( 212

race and human evolution by milford wolpoff and rachel caspari illustrated 462 pp new york simon schuster 26 for ages , confronting the ineffable mystery of their very being , people have conceived of cosmologies to satisfy a hunger to know where they came from in modern western societies , the search for origins has taken a scientific turn , often undermining traditional beliefs but leaving many questions unanswered indeed , the catechism of paleoanthropology , the study of human origins and evolution , seems in some respects to be a series of questions without firm answers nowhere is this provisional quality of knowledge more evident than in the current controversy over the origins of modern humans , the first people anatomically and mentally like us the dispute centers on two fundamentally different concepts the outofafrica theory versus the multiregional theory simply , one theory holds that modern homo sapiens is a relatively young species that evolved in one place , africa this population then expanded through the world , replacing related species the other theory posits multiple origins for the human species at different places archaic populations originating in africa migrated to distant regions and there evolved into modern humans separately , though not in total genetic isolation in this theory lies an explanation for human biological diversity as reflected in what are known as the different races recent research in molecular biology finding dna evidence that the eve of modern humanity seems to have lived in africa 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 years ago lends support to the outofafrica hypothesis but fossils can yield contradictory interpretations so scientists of equal accomplishment take opposite sides , while others hope some new discovery will resolve the issue the authors of race and human evolution are ardent multiregionalists , and their book is the first comprehensive exposition of that theory for a general audience its publication comes none too soon , for multiregionalism has been reduced to the role of foil to the evocative eve in most popular writing and scientific forums a recent article in an archeology journal even called the outofafrica theory effectively the only game in town milford wolpoff , a professor of anthropology at the university of michigan , is an architect \( with alan thorne of australia and wu xinzhi of china \) of the multiregional concept of human origins , and its most provocative defender his coauthor , rachel caspari , is a researcher in anthropology at michigan , and his wife their collaboration has produced a spirited book , at times personal and combative , always earnest and thorough they leave no doubt where they stand we predict we will never find a cradle of modern humanity , because a single source for modern humans does not exist one comes away from the book with many insights into the dynamics of developing , elaborating and defending a scientific thesis even the frustration overtaking the authors as they saw multiregionalism being either ignored or misunderstood and thus losing the public battle eve was glamorous and sexy , they concede eve was a simple theory that made science reporting easy and fun eve gave answers and represented 20thcentury technology providing answers telling us about our origins eve implied the brotherhood of all humankind and was politically correct so , as the eve theorists claimed the high moral ground , the authors write , multiregionalists were left behind trying to explain a more complex concept and defend it against possible misinterpretation as another example of racist thinking it was then that they realized how thoroughly we had inadvertently grasped the tar baby of racial politics mr wolpoff and ms caspari go to great lengths almost half of the book to distinguish their theory from the predarwinian concept of polygenism , which at various times served as an intellectual justification for colonialism , slavery and nazism s master race polygenism postulated the separate origins and independent evolution of the races along different , isolated lines among its influential exponents were the german scientist ernst haeckel in the 19th century , the harvard anthropologist earnest hooton in the early 20th century and , most recently , carleton coon , the harvardtrained author of the origin of races , published in 1962 polygenism is not to be confused with polycentrism , which the authors call the intellectual precursor of multiregionalism in his work with early human fossils from china and java in the 1930 s , franz weidenreich , a refugee from nazi germany , came to the central realization of polycentrism races reflect regional variations but are not the product of totally isolated , parallel evolutions , for regional populations never stopped exchanging genes the chapters of historical background , replete with fascinating accounts of past wars in anthropology , are a book within a book one sympathizes with the authors' conscientious effort to put distance between their theory and anthropology s racist past , but wishes there had been more streamlining here the authors seek to rebut the dna evidence for a recent origin only in africa , stressing flaws in data analysis cited by other scientists they also deal with the seeming paradox at the heart of polycentrismmultiregionalism how did populations retain regional distinctions and yet evolve together as one species , modern homo sapiens \? gene flow is the answer fossils preserve early traces of regional variations and what is interpreted as a gradual evolution toward modern humans but a certain amount of gene exchange insured that human evolution followed a common pattern and kept the variations from leading to separate regional species one source of misunderstanding about the theory , the authors believe , is its characterization as parallel evolution from a single common base long ago instead , they think of races as dynamic , changing entities with temporal depth because they are not the diverging branches on an evolutionary bush but the constantly separating and merging channels in a stream how close does this book take us to satisfying answers to the questions of how , when and where modern humans emerged \? supporters of the outofafrica theory are not likely to be swayed by the arguments here , but they are put on notice that the debate is far from over

loveland , colo , june 14 a struggle went on inside the jury room , in the hours and days leading up to timothy j mcveigh s conviction and death sentence , but the conflict was not one among the jurors themselves instead , it was a battle between the raw emotion they felt at the testimony about the carnage caused by the april 19 , 1995 , bombing in oklahoma city , which spilled over into frequent tears for some , and the stern judicial injunctions to keep sentiment and reasoning strictly separate this common internal conflict bound them together , several jurors suggested in interviews today , as did a shared bafflement at the mystery of mr mcveigh and his murderous act the result , the jurors suggested , was an unusual degree of closeness throughout the deliberations , and a final decision that was wrenching but hardly contentious from the start , they said , there was little dissension on the central questions of guilt and punishment we were a very closeknit group , said vera chubb , 65 , sitting in her living room in this pleasant lakefront city 50 miles north of denver from day 1 , our personalities were very close we meshed well together if we had questions , we could always sit down and talk it out in a last show of unity , 11 of the 12 jurors gathered this afternoon for a relaxed , cheerful news conference at a downtown denver hotel the foreman , james osgood , an engineer , made a point of thanking his colleagues for working together as such a cohesive team i think it embodied the true spirit of teamwork he spoke of the careful sifting and weighing that had taken place in the jury room when he said , i was compelled by the absolute plethora of evidence , none of his fellow jurors disagreed another juror , fred clarke , 42 , a computer programmer and retired air force veteran , said , it was not tense by any stretch of the imagination a third juror , tonya stedman , 24 , a waitress , connected tension inside the room to the testimony s emotional freight , but agreed on the essential unity of the jurors so tension , yes , emotion , yes , but i think we were very unified in the sense that we worked well together and we appreciated everyone s opinion , and we agreed to disagree at times , ms stedman said in an interview outside her denver home there were plenty of surface differences among the jurors one was a deadhead , an ardent fan of the grateful dead others were straightarrow military veterans or offspring of veterans , and one professed himself an enthusiast of rush limbaugh , the conservative radio show host but even before the five women and seven men began their deliberations , a number of elements appeared to bind them together most seemed to pay close attention throughout the weeks of testimony all developed great respect for judge richard p matsch , as was evident at this afternoon s press conference it was evident from day 1 he was in control , mr osgood said all expressed varying degrees of willingness to impose the death penalty most expressed a lack of interest in , or disdain for , the news media these ties served well once deliberations began the jurors shared a common sense that a terrible mystery lay at the heart of the case , even as they methodically reviewed , day by day , year by year , the events of the young man s life we all sat there and tried to figure out why a young man would do this , mrs chubb said , shaking her head slowly i 'd like to know what really got him started this way it s just a mystery a lot of us said , we just do n't understand , she added he planned this for almost two years he could have stopped at any time along the way the mystery was compounded by mr mcveigh s stony demeanor in court this upset a number of jurors i was very bothered that he showed no emotion , said john candelaria , a landscaper , at the afternoon press conference the horror at the crime that had been so intricately laid out for them mingled with the knowledge of the wrenching decision they would have to make at the end for the jurors , the deliberations were heavy with emotion we 're talking of convicting a man of guilt for a huge crime , no 1 , ms stedman said no 2 , proceeding to make a determination on whether he should live or die i mean , emotional is an understatement at times , mrs chubb said , the effect of the day s testimony was overwhelming some days , you would come home and think , i'm all right , then for some strange reason , tears would come to your eyes mr clarke , for one , was conscious of the need to keep feeling and analysis apart i might have shed a tear or two during the victims' testimony , but nothing i needed a tissue for , he said my job was just to sit there and listen , not to get emotional , but to listen and assimilate the information i equate it to putting together a puzzle when the time came for the final decision about mr mcveigh s fate , the jurors became especially methodical , mrs chubb said we said , this is a young man s life , she said we have got to give it every thought , every prayer everything we could think of , we went over you know what a terrible thing he did but when you have never had to do it , she said , referring to imposing the death sentence , it weighs a little heavy finally , after lunch on friday , the decision was made , and the final vote taken the room was quiet , mrs chubb said , very quiet the jurors sat in silence for a moment but they had made each other a promise , she said we all said , when they ask you , you will look him straight in the eye and say ,

a new study of mad cow disease is casting doubt on what sort of infectious agent causes this and similar illnesses the study , being published today in the journal science , questions the leading hypothesis about the cause of the disease this hypothesis holds that the disease is caused by abnormal forms of proteins called prions that enter the brain and cause a sort of chain reaction first , the hypothesis holds , the prions touch normal prion proteins in the brain then , in a process that is still not understood , they force the normal proteins to change their shapes and become like the abnormal ones this results in disease in the paper , dr dominique dormont of the neurovirology laboratory at the french atomic energy commission in fontenayauxroses and his colleagues asked whether abnormal prion proteins were always present in the brains of mice that had the illnesses the researchers infected healthy mice with brain tissue from cattle with mad cow disease , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy all the mice became ill with the degenerative brain disease but , dr dormont reported , about half the mice did not have abnormal prion proteins in the parts of their brains examined by the researchers the researchers then ground up the brains of the infected mice and used them to infect healthy mice the process was repeated with a third set of mice by that time , dr dormont reported , all the mice had abnormal prion proteins in their brains and the infectious agent , whatever it was , had become adapted to growing in the mice , so it was deadlier than ever dr dormont wrote in his paper that abnormal prion proteins might be part of the body s response to infection with a conventional agent , like a virus they might cling to a virus , coating it , in an effort to block it if that was so , abnormal prion proteins might be intimately associated with diseases like mad cow disease , yet not cause them dr ashley haase , the head of the microbiology department at the university of minnesota , said dr dormont s research destroys the simple notion that somehow the abnormal prion proteins could cause mad cow disease by themselves it does n't fit at all with the standard prion hypothesis , dr haase said it suggests there may be more to the story but nothing in the contentious field of prion research is simple dr dormont himself sought to tread a fine line in his paper , he wrote that an unidentified agent , rather than prions , may actually transmit mad cow disease in a telephone interview , however , he said that his paper is not an article that goes against the prion hypothesis it may be , he said , that the abnormal prions were present but that he failed to detect them until recently , prion arguments would have been consigned to the letters columns of scientific journals there were examples of prion diseases , but the ones that afflicted humans were so rare as to be medical oddities but with the apparent spread of mad cow disease from animals to humans , medical researchers say there is an urgent need to find out what infectious agent is causing the disease because an answer could show the way to diagnosis and possibly treatment the disease destroys the brain and is invariably fatal the greatest champion of the prions hypothesis is dr stanley prusiner of the university of california in san francisco dr prusiner coined the term prion , for proteinaceous infectious particle , in 1981 , and he has worked to demonstrate the hypothesis ever since dr prusiner s office said he declined to be interviewed about the new paper , and one of his colleagues , dr glenn telling , said it was dr prusiner s wish that none of his associates speak to the press dr paul brown , a researcher at the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke , who studies diseases like mad cow disease , said he would be won over to the prion hypothesis if anyone ever transmitted a disease by inoculating animals with pure prions but , dr brown said , that has not been done instead , investigators inoculate animals with brain tissue from infected animals , tissue that contains prions but that may also contain viruses there is not a shred of direct evidence , he said , that abnormal prion proteins in the brain force normal ones to change their shapes yet , dr brown said , the new paper does not disprove the prion hypothesis dr dormont , he said , did not examine every part of the animals' brains instead , he examined chunks of brain tissue , leaving open the possibility that he may have inadvertently disregarded the brain tissue that had the prions
washington , sept 3 several hundred district of columbia residents today protested the shift of power from the city s elected officials to a financial control board with a rally and march to the capitol the protesters listened to speeches for nearly two hours below the western front of the capitol before marching up constitution avenue to the hart senate office building though representative maxine waters , democrat of california , had urged the demonstrators to risk arrest with a sitin , no one entered the building to confront senator lauch faircloth , the north carolina republican whom many city residents blame for the loss of power instead , they listened to more speeches , prayed and vowed to march another day we made our point , said the rev graylan ellishagler of the plymouth congregation united church of christ , one of the speakers to go into this office at this point would be to dignify those people too much we 've already been seen the rally was part of a new grassroots opposition to the powers congress gave to the control board , which was created in 1995 to pull the district out of fiscal and management upheaval by law , only when the city has balanced its budget for four consecutive years will the mayor and other elected city officials regain their powers in its brief term so far , the board has replaced the elected school board with appointed trustees , installed new heads of the city s major agencies and made every major decision on contracting , employment and city operations , marginalizing mayor marion s barry jr and other city leaders it was mr faircloth , chairman of the senate district subcommittee , who insisted that greater managerial restraints on city officials be included in the 1998 federal budget in exchange for republican support of an administration rescue package for the district the package is worth nearly 1 billion for the district and includes a federal takeover of the city s pension liability , an increase in the federal share of the city s medicaid expenses and a series of federal tax cuts for district residents many citizens saw it as an unfair swap , and residents' groups have begun voicing displeasure , although the size of today s crowd , around 500 , hardly suggested that a city of 540 , 000 was up in arms even so , organizers said the rally s sponsors included 80 community groups , churches , unions and student organizations this movement is in its incipient stage , said jim cooper , a rally organizer it s just beginning to mobilize the city revolutions do take time to jell and formulate the crowd today heard from more than a dozen speakers , including the rev jesse l jackson and dick gregory but not mayor barry , who did not attend and none was so strident as ms waters , who implored the crowd to take stronger action you ought to be in the halls , lying down , she said , referring to congressional office buildings this struggle , this fight requires civil disobedience there were no sitins , and according to the metropolitan police department and the united states capitol police , no arrests photo several hundred district of columbia residents yesterday protested the shift of power to a financial control board protesters bowed their heads in prayer in front of the hart senate office building on capitol hill \( stephen crowley the new york times \)
cairo , march 14 the egyptian government recently seemed on the verge of declaring victory in its war against islamic militants who have been engaged in a campaign of violence for more than five years but a series of attacks that left 23 civilians dead in central egypt in the last month has undercut the government s claims of triumph when gunmen killed nine young people in a coptic christian church on feb 12 , the authorities tried to portray the attack as an isolated incident then on thursday night , the militants struck again , in a rampage 300 miles south of cairo that left 13 men dead , 9 of them copts , and was followed an hour later by an ambush that killed a woman traveling on a northbound train after five years in which the government has exacted heavy losses from the armed groups that have carried out such attacks , it is not known whether the latest strikes reflect mostly tenacity and resolve or might be a sign of the militants' resurgent power but the massacres that have bloodied first st george s church in abu qurqas and then the dirt roads of nag dawoud , a mostly christian hamlet , have left much of egypt shaken by the militants' willingness to commit sacrilege and coldblooded murder in the name of religion how can i feel safe when my daughter died as she prayed \? boutros shakir , 41 , asked in grief of a recent visitor to abu qurqas the daughter , olfat shakir , 17 , was to have been married at easter , but her father had come to the church for a different reason to collect a 600 cash grant offered by the government to help assuage his loss about the price of a cow , he said with about 10 percent of egypt s population of 62 million , coptic christians are a small minority in a country dominated by islam , and some have felt persecuted since long before they became targets of the militants' campaign , whose other targets have been police officers , informants and occasionally tourists militant leaders have in the past denounced the copts as nonbelievers , and top egyptian officials have said the militants may be trying to embarrass the government by setting off sectarian strife in an interview late last year , interior minister hassan alalfi asserted that the government had regained full control over its internal affairs in the face of the campaign begun by the militants more than five years ago to topple egypt s mostly secular government and install an islamic state while more than 1 , 100 people have died in the campaign , the annual death toll peaked in 1995 , at nearly 400 and until the attack in abu qurqas , nearly all the violence of the last 18 months had been confined to gun battles between the police and the militants in central egypt , far from the capital and most tourist sites since the militants declared war on the government in 1992 , thousands of egyptians have been jailed on suspicion of being linked to the militants scores have been sentenced to death , and more than 50 have been executed but egypt has seen past lulls interrupted by gruesome violence , most notably with an attack in cairo last april that left 18 greek tourists dead , and experts say the latest assaults make clear that the hardened government strategy has still not uprooted the passions that have driven the wave of violence the militants have been hit hard by the government , said hala mustafa , an expert on political militancy at the governmentsupported al ahram strategic studies center but they have compensated by hiding out and then staging heavy strikes , either a highprofile ambush or now by targeting the copts never before in egypt had gunmen committed so violent an act in a house of worship as they did in abu qurqas last month , and that has compounded the sadness and anger felt in the aftermath of the slayings on thursday , among the deadliest in more than half a decade of violence witnesses and security officials said the rampage lasted half an hour after three men armed with automatic weapons emerged from sugarcane fields and strode into the mostly christian village of nag dawoud the gunmen first opened fire at a tailor s shop , killing its owner and another man , the security officials said , then moved down the dirt main street , rattling off round after round from their automatic weapons until 11 more people were dead both in brazenness and in its apparent randomness , the attack was similar to the one a month earlier when four gunmen burst into st george s church in the middle of a youth meeting , and pulled machine guns from their jackets interviewed in abu qurqas recently , witnesses said two of the men had acted as sentries , while the other two advanced toward the altar , spraying fire left and right the bullets shattered windows and gouged walls , the witnesses said , and they ripped into the young people who had sat listening boys on one side , girls on the other as a deacon read from the book of luke in both cases , the attackers vanished into the night , but the authorities have said they have no doubt that all were islamic militants
east rutherford , nj , april 19 the devils put on an exhibition tonight on how to play defense in the stanley cup playoffs they limited the canadiens to just two shots in a span of 23 minutes , setting the tone for a 41 triumph at continental arena that gave new jersey a twogamestonone lead in this firstround matchup martin brodeur , who two nights ago became the second goaltender in the history of the playoffs to score a goal , had only one blemish tonight brian savage s goal , 1 of 22 shots he faced savage s goal came with 5 minutes 27 seconds left , after the devils had scored all their goals on 41 shots against jocelyn thibault we went for 60 minutes tonight and it made my job a lot easier , brodeur said of the solid defense by his teammates while brodeur and the defense carried out their duties almost to perfection , john maclean led the devils' offense with the game s first two goals scores by bill guerin and bob carpenter then sealed the victory the first three goals by the devils came on the power play , with dave manson of the canadiens in the penalty box in each instance after finishing tied for 22d in the league with the man advantage during the regular season , the devils did a whole lot better in this game in fact , the sudden improvement is reminiscent of what happened when new jersey won the stanley cup two years ago that season , they were one of the worst teams in the league with the man advantage in the regular season and one of the best in the playoffs what i see is that we 're working harder , coach jacques lemaire said about the team s new effectiveness on the power play we looked organized , we got the shots and guys were going to the net the triumph gave the devils a clear edge in the series , which will shift to montreal for the next two games , and brought something new to hockey fans in the area and the entire national hockey league when maclean scored his second goal of the game , 11 29 into the middle period , a boar s head was thrown onto the ice near the montreal goal it was taken away in a shovel to the delight of the sellout crowd let detroit fans have their live octopuses and florida fans their plastic rats one of the devils' advocates came up with his own idea the danger , of course , is that if it catches on , the devils will end up drawing a twominute bench penalty for delaying the game , a provision enacted by the nhl because of all the rats in florida in fact , a warning to that effect was announced over the publicaddress system tonight after the boar s head hit the ice but for the moment , there was laughter in the devils' locker room was that a pig s head \? maclean asked after the game maybe it was sammy the bull , he added with a laugh in a reference to sammy gravano , the mobster who turned informer on john gotti the devils took 15 shots in the opening period against thibault , and converted on their seventh attempt , which came from maclean during the first manpower advantage for the home team with less than six minutes gone in the game maclean s goal came when he onetimed a blistering shot from the spot inside the left circle that beat thibault through the legs maclean s second goal was again scored through thibault s legs , but this time it was from the lower part of the left circle and from a pass by scott niedermayer guerin , who scored the winner in the 52 triumph in the first game of the series two nights ago , gave the devils a threegoal cushion with a shot from the top of the right circle with 4 11 left in the second period carpenter s goal came from close range on the right side after a pass by maclean early in the last period and ended any hope for the canadiens the victory was the eighth in a row in the playoffs for the devils they beat philadelphia in the last two games of the eastern conference finals two years ago before sweeping detroit in the stanley cup finals i felt that we played very well tonight , lemaire said all three periods we were solid slap shots the devils announced before the game that dave andreychuk underwent surgery on his broken left ankle friday andreychuk had a pin put in his ankle to stabilize the broken bone the successful procedure was performed by dr barry fisher , the team orthopedist , at st barnabas medical center in livingston , nj the surgery did not change the prognosis on andreychuk s return , which is estimated to be around four weeks eric houde of the canadiens played in place of benoit brunet , who was a late scratch because of the flu photo canadiens goalie jocelyn thibault facing a shot by the devils' john maclean last night maclean scored on the play for the first of his two goals \( norman y lono for the new york times \)
montreal , april 7 nobody , as coach rick bowness pointed out , can accuse the islanders of going down without a fight but down they went anyway to a crushing 21 defeat to the montreal canadiens tonight on a deflected benoit brunet backhander with 3 minutes 10 seconds left and down with them almost certainly went any hopes for the postseason the winning goal was set up by the former islander vladimir malakhov , who scored the canadiens' only other goal tonight with overtime rapidly approaching , malakhov s shot from the left point was intercepted by brunet , whose own low shot from the slot skipped off islanders defenseman scott lachance and went up and over a game tommy salo the goal enabled the seventhplace canadiens to pull 6 points ahead of the islanders in the eastern conference with three games to play to make matters worse , the hartford whalers rallied for a 42 victory at home over buffalo to take sole possession of the eighth and final playoff spot with 73 points , 1 fewer than the canadiens and 5 more than the islanders \( 283912 \) , who are 031 in their last four games and who can only accumulate 6 more points , provided they win the rest of their games the islanders , who face the canadiens again at home on wednesday , still have a mathematical chance to advance to the postseason for the first time in three seasons but that chance is rapidly approaching zero after yet another heartbreaking loss not that the islanders folded up this is the second game in a row now where a fluky goal has beaten us , bowness lamented afterward we 're 5 points behind hartford they 're going to have to lose all their games montreal is going to have to lose all its games and we 'll go from there but we 're certainly not going down without a fight in fact , just when it was almost safe to write off the islanders' playoff hopes for another season , ken belanger and todd bertuzzi delayed the inevitable by teaming up for the tying goal 6 48 into the final period , setting the stage for a frenetic , nerveracking finish bertuzzi s 10th goal of the season came less than a minute after the islanders had dodged a serious bullet an unheard of fouronnone rush on salo , with darcy tucker , who was leading the way , hitting the crossbar meanwhile , jocelyn thibault \( who finished with 25 saves \) was outstanding at the other end , trying to protect a 10 lead thibault had just stopped zigmund palffy on a shorthanded onetimer \( he had denied palffy on an earlier breakaway \) and appeared to be on his way to a shutout but belanger , an enforcer , scooped up a loose puck , slipped past defenseman stephane quintal along the left boards with a nifty move in the neutral zone , drove in on thibault , spun and found bertuzzi with a backhand pass bertuzzi onetimed the feed home and , after nearly 47 scoreless minutes , the islanders had a pulse again they could only prolong the agony by 10 minutes , however salo , who made 33 saves in a strong outing despite allowing a soft early goal to malakhov , would later say , this hurts as bad as any loss i 've ever had disheartening , was the word lachance used to describe the defeat lachance said of the winning goal we were kind of running around , and malakhov took the shot from the point brunet picked it off and i went at him it went off my skate and my glove at the same time and dropped over tommy s head it was a tough break it s frustrating because of the way we came back which has been a seasonlong story for the islanders we should be in the playoffs , said salo , who added that he never saw the puck after it skipped up off of lachance we lost so many games with less than five minutes left that s the difference right there if there were any signs of tightness at the morning skate , or even before the game , they were not evident the islanders appeared loose , even though they were facing a mustwin situation but once the game started , the islanders were rarely able to get untracked over the first two periods and when they did , thibault was there to stop them yet the islanders trailed by only a goal going into the final period the irony was that that goal was scored by malakhov the brooding defenseman had not scored a goal since feb 25 , and had just three assists in that span , before he beat salo on the power play 7 15 into the game it was not much of a goal malakhov threw it on net from all the way above the left circle but the puck caromed off the inside of salo s right leg and in and that was the scoring over the first two periods all while the whalers were rallying past the sabres in hartford you looked around the room after the game , everybody knew what this game meant , lachance said i think we played well we missed some golden chances , a few breakaways it s disheartening , the way we lost photo islanders goalie tommy salo making one of his 33 saves last night two montreal goals were enough , though \( reuters \)
the hot line volunteers at the national women s health network were prepared for a deluge of calls this week from confused women asking what to do about mammograms but the calls did not come , and a recent survey , as well as comments by practicing doctors and some social scientists , suggest that the reason is that when it comes to mammograms , women pay attention to what their doctors say , not to panels of experts on thursday , the national cancer institute announced that it was recommending that women in their 40 s have mammograms every one to two years , saying that the screening test could cut the breast cancer death rate by 17 percent also last week , the american cancer society urged yearly mammograms for women in their 40 s both recommendations went against findings announced in january by a consensus panel of experts convened to advise the national institutes of health on mammograms that panel declined to recommend that women have mammograms , an xray screening test , before 50 , when its benefits are clear the group said there were no convincing data showing that mammograms saved the lives of younger women the cancer institute s conclusion last week was also a reversal of the decision it reached in 1993 not to recommend regular mammograms for women in their 40 s but there were no calls to the national women s health network about mammograms , said lisa cox , the group s program director individual doctors also said their telephones had been silent on the issue dr mary beard , an obstetrician and gynecologist in private practice in salt lake city , said no one had called her about the conflicting mammogram recommendations , as did dr carolyn v brown , an obstetrician and gynecologist in south burlington , vt none of my patients have called me , said dr ezra davidson , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at drew university school of medicine and science in los angeles it is , ms cox said , a puzzlement in this age of patient advocacy , in this time of fear of breast cancer , should n't women be utterly confused by conflicting advice from three different panels of experts \? i hope this is n't a trend , ms cox said but what has been overlooked , some social scientists and doctors said , is that most patients are not eager to review medical data and then tell their doctors what they want to do instead , they look for caring , informed doctors who will make the decision for them and those doctors largely seem to have been convinced for years that women in their 40 s should have regular mammograms they seem to have paid little heed to groups like the consensus panel in january or the national cancer institute in 1993 when they said the test had not been shown to benefit younger women the national cancer institute said it had no data yet on whether its 1993 decision to drop its mammography recommendation for women in their 40 s had resulted in fewer women having the screening test but there is some evidence that the advice has been widely ignored dr sarah fox , a health services researcher at the university of california at los angeles , said she had surveyed doctors to ask them how they advised younger women when i ask doctors , 'what s the average age that you get women into screening \? ' it comes out to be 45 , she said dr beard she has always told women in their 40 s to have mammograms , she said , because she has been persuaded of their benefit by her own clinical experience she said she had had a number of patients who had mammograms in their 40 s and discovered that they had tiny tumors their cancers were found so early that they could be treated easily with lumpectomies , she said , and the women s lives were probably saved our whole goal is to detect lesions early , dr beard said so when the cancer institute in 1993 and the consensus panel in january said there was no demonstrable benefit of routine mammography for women in their 40 s , dr beard did not change her practice , she said i said , 'hey , what i'm seeing and what they 're seeing is not the same , ' she said although many doctors and women would have the same reaction as dr beard , many scientists shudder at the tyranny of the anecdote the reason researchers do clinical trials with tens of thousands of women is that the benefits of mammograms are too subtle to be determined by simply noticing what happens to a few women , whose tumors might or might not have turned out to be deadly even if they had not had a mammogram one of the hardest things for women and doctors to understand is that catching small tumors does n't necessarily save lives , said dr suzanne w fletcher , a professor of ambulatory care and preventive medicine at harvard medical school recommending mammograms for women in their 40 s may also be the simplest course for doctors after all , this lets them avoid possible lawsuits from women who were not screened and who turned out to have cancer dr brown said it s very much defensive medicine to recommend mammograms nonetheless , dr brown said , she personally believes in mammograms for younger women she said her patients are looking for a clinician who they trust to tell them what to do dr fox agreed she said her work and that of others indicated that women relied on their doctors and tended to follow doctors' recommendations , especially if the doctor seems to care about them dr nicole urban , a statistician at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle , said that her work surveying women in the state of washington , as well as similar survey work by others , was very consistent that the physician s recommendation is the most powerful predictor of whether a woman will have a mammogram in dr urban s studies of a number of controversial screening tests , including mammograms , she found that physicians tend not to pay much attention to patient requests if doctors think that a test is important , they do not spend much time asking patients their opinion they simply recommend the test dr urban said she had concluded that guidelines really were important , but for doctors , not patients
the warning by a federal aviation agency that the boeing 737 , the workhorse of the american air transport system , is less safe than other aircraft is being greeted with a collective shrug of indifference by passengers travel agents , corporate travel managers and other industry officials said yesterday that most passengers demonstrated unshaken confidence in the overall safety of air travel and appear to feel that the government would have grounded the nation s fleet of 1 , 100 737 s if they were truly dangerous while the national transportation safety board noted thursday that failure of a valve that controls the plane s rudder could cause the plane to crash , it also called such failures rare nonetheless , without saying so in its letter to the federal aviation administration , the safety agency strongly suggested that it had found the cause of two crashes that killed a total of 157 people a usair flight in pittsburgh in 1994 and a united airlines flight in colorado springs in 1991 boeing , the plane s manufacturer , disputed any conclusion that the 737 was less airworthy than other aircraft airlines continue to use it , although the faa announced last month that it would propose replacing the valves however , boeing has yet to design new ones meantime , airlines have been making changes in their emergency manuals and have been training pilots in how to deal with the valve problem should it occur the safety board did its job , said judie shyman , president of the national business travel association , but there s no proof that the rudder problem caused those two crashes ms shyman said none of the presidents of her association s 41 local chapters , who were attending a regularly scheduled meeting yesterday in tampa , fla , had heard of passengers expressing any concern about the safety of the 737 likewise , patty mcmenamin , a spokeswoman for rosenbluth international , the large business travel agency with headquarters in philadelphia , said its agents were not aware of anyone who had asked to be booked on other aircraft fares and what seat they 're in , those are the two most frequent questions , said andrea ritchie , president of northwestern business travel , a large agency in minneapolis she added that passengers appeared confident in the government s regulatory oversight of the industry they think that if there really is a problem with an airplane , the government will take it out of the air , she said mark a johnson , travel manager at cessna aircraft in wichita , kan , said he had no concern whatever about the 737 , which the faa said in a 1995 report had one of the best safety records in the fleet of transport category airplanes even though it would require two years to replace the valves in all 737 s , mr johnson said , it does n't seem to us to be a major problem , where we 'd want to redirect our travelers onto different airplanes passenger reaction to concerns about the 737 is in sharp contrast to the fallout from crashes of the dc10 in the 1970 s when an american airlines dc10 crashed and killed 273 in may 1979 , the faa grounded all dc10 s for 37 days government reports subsequently blamed design deficiencies and maintenance procedures for the crash passengers booked flights on other aircraft airlines are also expressing confidence in their 737 fleets linda rutherford , a spokeswoman for southwest airlines , whose entire fleet of 245 planes is composed of 737 s , said , we have a 26year legacy operating only 737 s , and we have never had a single fatality or a major accident she added that there were a few inquiries yesterday from customers asking about southwest s rudder system and maintenance program , but not anything like last month , when vice president al gore said the faa planned to propose changing the valves several other big owners of 737 s , including usair , continental airlines and united , a unit of ual , said yesterday that they started training their pilots several years ago in socalled advance maneuvers to guard against rudder problems that result from valves that jam in its report , the ntsb said valves could jam and then reverse , causing the rudder to move in the opposite direction commanded by the pilot boeing has estimated that replacement hardware would cost 50 , 000 a plane the company said airlines would have to pay the cost of installation united estimated that the labor cost of replacing the part in its fleet of 219 737 s would be about 400 , 000 on many routes , passengers have no choice but to fly on 737 s , and on other routes propeller planes are the only alternative with many people accustomed to smaller , less sophisticated turboprops , they are less likely to fear the larger 737 s we 're not hesitant at all about flying the 737 , said jane jordan , the owner of mainstream travel in greenville , miss we 're so used to having small commuter airplanes that people just feel safer on those big planes while the regional airline association insists that commuter airlines are as safe as the bigger carriers , many passengers still prefer the bigger planes , especially jets
gaza , aug 20 defying israeli and american demands that he crack down on islamic militants , yasir arafat kissed and applauded leaders of the hamas and islamic holy war movements today and warned that palestinians were prepared to resume their violent revolt against israel at a conference of palestinian factions here , mr arafat returned to the combative language of the sevenyear uprising against israeli occupation , which ended in 1994 with the beginning of palestinian self rule there was an uprising for seven years , mr arafat told the conference , which he called to protest the policies of prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel who did it \? the lion cubs , our children this glorious uprising seven years we can erase and do it again from the beginning there is nothing far from us all options are open to us as he has many times in his career , mr arafat was fighting on several fronts at once his remarks came just days after dennis b ross , the american mediator , prodded him to renew security cooperation with the israelis and take action against hamas and other hardline islamic groups that have carried out terrorist bombings in israel mr arafat met tuesday with the head of shin bet , the israeli domestic security agency , as he began to comply with that request but at today s session in gaza , called the national unity conference to confront the challenges , mr arafat was lining up support from a broad array of factions , including the militant islamic groups who favor a more confrontational stance toward the israelis the islamic groups said they saw the meeting as a means of resisting the crackdown by the palestinian authority that israel and the united states are demanding \( in washington , senior american officials were dismayed by mr arafat s remarks it simply makes an already difficult situation more difficult , one official said we have a crisis of confidence , so no party should do or say things that undermine confidence about a peaceful resolution of their differences \( james p rubin , the state department spokesman , said the united states remained convinced that mr arafat s would carry out his pledge to cooperate with the israelis against terrorism we are going to judge , in the area of security cooperation and antiterrorist cooperation , chairman arafat by deeds , he said deeds are the coin of the realm when it comes to fighting terrorism \) today s conference in gaza was significant because it marked the first time islamic holy war , a militant group that operates primarily in gaza , had joined a meeting of palestinian factions under mr arafat s leadership unlike hamas , which has both social programs and a military wing , islamic holy war has devoted itself almost exclusively to attacks on israel at the conference , representatives of hamas and islamic holy war , who are political leaders of their organizations , not members of their clandestine military wings , exchanged customary kisses with mr arafat after their speeches they said later that their participation in mr arafat s conference did not mean they were renouncing violence , as the palestinian leader did in reaching an accord with the israelis the delegates said they remain implacably opposed to the agreement reached in oslo in 1993 between israel and the palestine liberation organization this is not a conference to support oslo , but to support the stance of our people against the american and israeli pressures on the palestinian authority to arrest and crack down on the islamic movements , said abdel aziz alrantisi , a hamas leader the relationship between mr arafat and the israeli government , which had been strained , worsened considerably last month after a suicide bombing in a jerusalem market on july 30 in which 14 people and the two attackers were killed israel demanded that mr arafat take action against hamas and islamic holy war and it imposed economic sanctions and other punitive measures that the palestinian leader condemned as a declaration of war against his people the measures included closing borders , demolishing houses of palestinians on the grounds that they were built without permits , and freezing payments of taxes and other money to the palestinian authority israel s moves united palestinians of all political stripes behind mr arafat many perceive him as standing up to heavy israeli and american pressures to suppress the militants united states officials have backed the israeli demands , but they have also urged israel to rescind economic sanctions that are not directly linked to its security to ease the economic pressure , president hosni mubarak of egypt pledged tuesday to give the palestinian authority 10 million israeli officials criticized mr arafat for inviting hamas and islamic holy war to the gaza conference , asserting that his invitation of groups responsible for bombings that killed scores of israelis contradicted his commitment to fight terrorism mr arafat is giving the terrorist organizations a stamp of approval , said david barillan , communications director for prime minister netanyahu mr arafat and his aides might think that appeasing , pacifying and placating these organizations will do the trick , mr barillan added , but they already tried that , and we found that all this dialogue does is give these organizations the respectability and legitimacy which makes it easier for them to continue their terrorist activity with impunity but tayeb abdel rahim , a close aide of mr arafat who was chairman of the conference , rejected the israeli criticism none of the speakers advocated explosions or terrorism , he said they all protested the israeli policy that disregards the peace process they agreed on a common denominator of rejecting the policy of dictation the speakers , apparently following rules agreed upon in advance , did not call explicitly for violence against israel , but instead urged resistance , confrontation and struggle against the israeli enemy many called on mr arafat to stop security cooperation and negotiations with the israelis , and urged a boycott of israeli products in response to the israeli border closures they criticized american officials for what they described as a stance that favors israel , and they urged mr arafat to resist israeli dictates backed by the americans to crack down on militant groups mr arafat has recently renewed security contacts at the urging of the americans , and he met on tuesday with ami ayalon , the head of shin bet , the israeli security service but before the conference delegates he vowed never to submit to israeli economic and political pressures in the name of our children , he said , the children of the uprising , i say no one can

washington , may 27 the central intelligence agency , plotting to overthrow the guatemalan government in the early 1950 s , drew up a disposal list of at least 58 key leaders , and it trained assassins to kill them , newly declassified documents show the coup , codenamed operation success , toppled the freely elected president of guatemala , jacobo arbenz guzman , and installed the first of a series of rightwing leaders friendly to the united states the assassination plans were never carried out , according to an official cia history of the coup until the day that arbenz resigned in june 1954 the option of assassination was still being considered , the history concludes the 1 , 400 pages of newly declassified documents represent fewer than 1 percent of the cia s files on the coup a former cia official , clair e george , testified in 1983 that the agency s records on the coup ran to about 180 , 000 pages the cia also deleted the names of the americans who carried out the coup those whose titles show up , but whose names were stricken from the records , include agency officials whose identities have long been public , like frank wisner , then the agency s chief of covert operations , and his field commander for the coup , col albert haney this censorship drew a statement of regret on sunday from guatemala s minister of foreign affairs , eduardo stein the documents add at least three sets of important new information to the historical record the existence of the assassination plans of the agency , aspects of its propaganda campaign against mr arbenz , and details of the agency s early efforts to recruit members of the guatemalan military the planning began in 1952 , after the president of nicaragua , anastasio somoza debayle , proposed to president harry s truman that they work together to overthrow mr arbenz , who had been elected in 1950 mr arbenz s leftwing politics angered the united states mr truman told the cia to go forward the agency launched a shortlived operation , shipping guns and money to guatemalan exiles the operation s cover was blown within five weeks and it was abandoned in october 1952 but the plan lived on in 1953 , under president eisenhower , the cia drew up plans for assassinations , sabotage and propaganda to overthrow mr arbenz the assassination list contained the names of at least 58 guatemalan supporters of mr guzman who the cia suspected were communists late that year , the national security council gave operation success the goahead the state department , by then led by john foster dulles , the brother of the director of central intelligence , allen w dulles , worked closely with the cia the coup went quickly , from june 16 through june 27 , 1954 , with radio propaganda and political subversion proving to be the most effective weapons mr arbenz resigned , denounced the united states and took refuge in mexico cia plans for operation success called for the assassinations , and the plans were discussed in great detail at very high levels of the agency and the state department , the records show no record of the formal approval or disapproval of the plans by president eisenhower or the dulles brothers has been made public none likely exists the newly released files include a 22page howto manual on murder that says , no assassination instructions should ever be written or recorded the cia records show that it conducted what it called a nerve war against some of these targets government officials , unfriendly army officers and the like in 1953 and 1954 its plans included sending them death threats telephoning them , preferably between 2 and 5 am , with bloodcurdling warnings , and denouncing them to their superiors with accusations ranging from treason to tax evasion and they show that the agency considered the guatemalan military the only organized element in guatemala through which political change could take place that change , says a 1953 cia document , had to begin with the subversion and defection of army leaders the agency has had guatemalan military men on its payroll ever since the 1954 coup was the first chapter in the cia s long and continuing liaison with the guatemalan military those ties deepened over the decades during a scorchedearth campaign against a small communist insurgency the civil war in guatemala , touched off in part by the coup , ended only five months ago more than 100 , 000 civilians were killed

washington so how weird is this \? the clinton presidency that began with such grandiose designs has become so becalmed , so shrunken , so defeated , so aimless , so anomic , so technical that george bush now looms as a giant who bestrode the earth clinton white house reporters tell me they envy my time covering mr bush , that he seems more interesting the bush domestic policy , known as statusquo plus , suddenly looks retroactively ambitious , compared with clinton drift it turns out that was an activist presidency , says michael duffy , a time reporter who cowrote a book on the bush years called marching in place after briefings with erskine bowles , you begin to yearn for five minutes of good , oldfashioned abuse from john sununu compared with the listless president hobbled by crutches and investigations , paralyzed by the fear of offending anyone , his 72yearold predecessor appears the master of his fate skydiving and holding up rabbit ears behind his wife s head at the gerald ford museum rededication mr bush laid the groundwork for the new budget deal and points of light , much mocked by democrats in '92 , is practically all that remains of bill clinton s social policy i faxed the expresident in houston to tell him he was looming large looming large \? with whom , for whom \? he faxed back , in one of his famous freeform letters \( self typed i might add \) he requested that i read the note and then eat it before addressing my questions , mr bush asked about a biting description of him in '88 but why am i like every girl s first husband \? unfair ! i wondered if he was appalled that mr clinton was reduced to purloining conservative premises i'm glad about that , he faxed back volunteerism , less government , china , haiti boat people , nafta i like it that our policies made some sense to those who came along after me we did leave a very strong economy in 1992 , but did n't your colleagues want 'change' and was n't i , to them , 'out of touch' \? i was curious about the deeper meaning of those rabbit ears fun , strictly fun , and i do n't have to worry now how the press corps will analyze this i used to but now , i am free at last make that relatively free at last i do n't want the washington ny corps charging down to texas and florida saying to my boys 'defend your old man has he lost it these days \? ' yesterday at a maui photo op , the silver fox rabbit eared me could n't even let me go one up without retaliation so what did he learn at the conference on his presidency at hofstra \? i learned there are some real whacko professors scattered out around the country mistakes \? i wish i had been a reaganesque communicator but then do i \? for life is good now , it really is he said he had not expected so much fascination about his jump at 12 , 500 feet out of a plane the only fear i felt was fear itself but once in free fall it was heaven i 'd do it again but i'm not sure this second one would n't be written off by the wispy libs and oh so serious pundits as 'look at the old guy , trying to garner more good press' asked about bob dole s comment that he had considered asking mr bush to help pay off newt gingrich s debt , he said he probably would have if asked did he give any advice to mr clinton at the volunteerism summit \? are you kidding \? he asked as for democrats arguing , at news of the clintons auctioning off the lincoln bedroom and air force one , that both parties did that sort of fundraising , mr bush noted everybody did not do it honest ! he said he missed some things about washington the white house staff and camp david to some degree , i miss making decisions that matter but , bpb and i are both very happy i have no desire to shape history none no memoirs lie ahead only the scowcroftbush treatise , which will interest foreign policy wonks and name droppers i think it will be ok , though i expect some critics will trash us it will say what it was like dealing with gorby , mt , mitterrand , major , mulroney , kaifu and miyazawa , the guy i threw up on ! it will explain why i think saddam hussein is a really nice guy and why i regret not 'letting sanctions work' no , no wrong book
chicago , july 3 as president clinton spoke at a rally at the daley plaza here , days before his reelection last november , a senior white house aide groused privately that the president had had no choice but to share the stage with senator carol moseleybraun , once the pride of the democratic party and now one of its bigger embarrassments ms moseleybraun was an electoral sensation in 1992 when she catapulted from obscurity as the cook county recorder of deeds to became the first africanamerican woman elected to the senate but her tenure as illinois' senior senator has been marred by a rash of miscues and episodes of questionable judgment , including disclosures about her financial practices and her private life and her secret visit to nigeria last summer to meet with the country s brutal dictator , drawing negative publicity just as her party was about to assemble for its national convention in this city now , ms moseleybraun , a 49yearold lawyer , is viewed as perhaps the most endangered senator running for reelection next year so much so that senator trent lott of mississippi , the republican leader , summoned this state s popular governor , jim edgar , to washington last week to entice him to challenge her days earlier , the chicago tribune had published a poll that found that among people who usually vote in illinois elections , only a third wanted ms moseleybraun reelected the survey said her support among white suburban women , who were crucial to her election , had hemorrhaged and her favorable rating was a rockbottom 37 percent , compared with 64 percent for governor edgar yet for all of her vulnerability , democrats from here to washington have acted early to embrace ms moseleybraun and discourage democrats from challenging her in a crucial move that has scared off rivals , mayor richard m daley bestowed an early endorsement on ms moseleybraun and mr clinton , returning last week for a fundraising event that helped her erase a fouryearold campaign debt , declared that she deserves your support the turnabout among democrats reflects the sensitive politics of race rather than the accomplishments of ms moseleybraun many democrats said they would be wary of the backlash if they took her on , particularly since this state has no other highly visible black politicians several democrats also said they had no appetite to reopen the racial tensions of a decade ago , when a black mayor , harold washington , was elected in chicago over two white challengers and the politics of race upended the city s oncemonolithic democratic machine some said they were acting out of selfinterest if black voters were alienated , they might not turn out for other democratic candidates the decision to close ranks around ms moseleybraun so early also reflects the democratic party s problems in recruiting appealing candidates the illinois democratic party has been little more than a shell since many of the state s most promising democratic elected officials were wiped out in the 1994 elections moreover , several democrats said that finding a more formidable candidate was not worth the upheaval it would cause the state party there s this aura of having messed up , said dawn clark netsch , an illinois democrat who unsuccessfully challenged governor edgar in 1994 and who once introduced ms moseleybraun in the 1992 campaign as a national heroine all of these distractions have clearly crippled her effectiveness the way you hear it expressed most often is that she messes up her personal life' and 'if she 'd just get her act together' what substance she s been involved with she has a hard time getting out because the rest of it overwhelms explaining that she would still vote for ms moseleybraun against a republican , ms netsch said , what else can we do \? in an interview here , ms moseleybraun was lively and composed , and dismissed her missteps with hearty laughter for every blessing you get , she said , the devil s going to try to take it away ms moseleybraun \( pronounced moseleebrawn \) acknowledged that she had had difficulty making the switch to a national stage , and she still appears surprised that united states senators are held to higher expectations than ordinary citizens one of the most wrenching parts of the transition to the senate has been coming to grips with not having a private life , she said , largely attributing her misfortune to having not been a very good self promoter she said her meeting with gen sani abacha , nigeria s dictator , for which she was rebuked by the state department and criticized by humanrights advocates for lending legitimacy to that regime , was a mistake only because she had not announced it at news conference first it frankly did not occur to me at all , she said it was like going to the hardware store with no makeup on it was n't a secret then , turning to a reporter , she asked , do you call a press conference when you go on vacation \? she has described the nigerian trip as an effort at quiet diplomacy on environmental and human rights issues the senator s companion on the trip was kgosie matthews , her former fiance and former campaign manager , who has been tied to many of her troubles and who has been registered with the justice department as an agent for nigeria among the tempests that have swirled around ms moseleybraun
london reconstructed in a studio in london s east end , soho s colony room club looks seedily authentic and as always , the champagne is flowing , the mood bohemian , the language florid then , in walks francis bacon , already in the mid1960 s hailed as britain s greatest postwar painter or rather , in walks the shakespearean actor derek jacobi looking sufficiently like bacon to shock some extras who knew the stocky broadfaced artist bacon is a regular in the club that he nicknamed a concentration of camp and he is promptly welcomed by his drinking mates with a roar of jokes and gossip trailing him is a darkhaired young man this is george , he says introduce yourselves george is a little shy as it happens , the newcomer , george dyer , played here by daniel craig , would soon become a familiar face at the colony room because over the next seven years he was bacon s principal lover and most important model and it is their stormy relationship that the british director and screenwriter john maybury has chosen to focus on in love is the devil , the first feature film about bacon , whose paintings are distinguished by their anguished and tortured human forms the movie , which is to be released early next year , ends with dyer s suicide on the eve of bacon s major retrospective at the grand palais in paris in october 1971 bacon himself lived another 21 years it s as much the george dyer story as it is the francis bacon story , although i see bacon as the central character , mr maybury , 39 , said in an interview in paris on the eve of completing seven weeks of filming in london and paris earlier this summer bacon is an incredibly fascinating character , as a painter , as an englishirishman and as a character in london the idea of turning the lives of great artists into movies has been an attractive one for a long time in the 1930 s , charles laughton played the title role in rembrandt in the 1950 s , kirk douglas was van gogh in lust for life in the 1960 s , charlton heston took on michelangelo and the sistine chapel in the agony and the ecstasy and the list goes on movies good and bad , over the years , about caravaggio , modigliani , camille claudel , munch , toulouselautrec and warhol , plus two more about van gogh , one more about rembrandt and many others a good many of those movies were arthouse films the new film about bacon , however , seems to be part of a new wave of film portraits of painters intended for larger audiences , in europe and the united states of late , there have been christopher hampton s carrington , about the english painter leonora carrington s relationship with the writer lytton strachey ismail merchant and james ivory s surviving picasso , about picasso s 10year liaison with francoise gilot , and basquiat , the painter julian schnabel s tribute to the young new york graffiti artist jeanmichel basquiat , who died of a drug overdose in 1988 in addition to love is the devil , movies are being prepared about the mexican artist frida kahlo , the abstract expressionist master jackson pollock and \( again \) rembrandt there is also talk of movies about georgia o'keeffe \( michelle pfeiffer is interested \) , diane arbus , robert mapplethorpe and , again , modigliani what gives these films a new sort of audience appeal is that like many of today s biographies , they are not simply paeans rather , the artists are being portrayed as flawed human beings , people whose emotional torments , personal tragedies , assorted addictions or sexual unorthodoxies are as important as their art true , without their art , their private dramas and frequent forms of selfdestruction might seem tawdry , even commonplace but it is evidently easier to understand their pain than it is to fathom their genius and it is often pain or some form of inner turmoil that drives the creative process how often can you take shots of a painter painting \? james ivory asked during the making of surviving picasso what s interesting is how their lives shaped their art , what caused the art to be the kind of thing that it was certainly , in surviving picasso and carrington , the artist is rarely seen at work basquiat gives a better idea of the young painter s vision , although the film dwells on how fame , money and greed eventually crush him in love is the devil , while the director tries to balance life and art , the screenplay shows bacon more often at play drinking , gambling , cooking , watching boxing , making love than at the easel mr maybury , who studied art in london before turning to avantgarde and experimental films , said he was first invited by the bbc a couple of years ago to direct a conventional biopic , what he calls a francis bacon was born in dublin in 1909 movie , but he quickly lost interest and withdrew three months later , he was invited back to write his own screenplay about bacon this time , he jumped he said he had always liked bacon s paintings of dyer and had wondered what lay behind them he also felt a certain identity with the painter
to timbuktu a journey down the niger by mark jenkins illustrated 224 pages william morrow 25 the plain truth is that there are very few inaccessible destinations anymore , not , at any rate , in a world where lhasa and katmandu , khartoum and kashgar have become easy to get to on your retirement tours but timbuktu there s a name that has a ring to it as mark jenkins makes clear in to timbuktu , his laconically engaging account of a trip to some of the less frequented parts of west and central africa , timbuktu has had a mythical quality since the early 14th century it was then that mansa musa , emperor of mali , emerged from there at the head of a caravan so laden with gold that his camels stumbled in the egyptian desert mr jenkins , who has done his background reading , intersperses his own quest to reach timbuktu , by kayaking down the niger river , with the illfated efforts of a series of 18th and 19thcentury european explorers to reach the same destination most of them died , some at the hands of fierce tuareg warriors , more of them from malaria or dysentery when maj gordon laing , crippled and scarred from a tuareg attack , entered the city in 1826 , he did not let on that the fabled metropolis failed to live up to expectations laing was beheaded 30 miles north of timbuktu at the beginning of his journey back to england it was n't until three years later that the frenchman rene caillie arrived in the city and announced to a disbelieving world that timbuktu was a standard trading town in central africa , a poor collection of mud buildings and no gold at all in any case , mr jenkins , an outdoorsman and traveler from wyoming , had few illusions about timbuktu himself he and his closest friend , mike moe , decided in 1991 to be the first westerners to explore the headwaters of the niger in the mountains of guinea and then to make their way by kayak to timbuktu and beyond they decided to do this even though both their wives were pregnant with their first children joined by two other wyoming friends , a carpenter and a banker , they set off on an eventful and sobering journey they did not generally succeed in their mission , except for the niger headwaters part of their plan they did not even have a very good time hundreds of miles from timbuktu , the four divided up , two to continue down the river , mr jenkins to go on to timbuktu overland by motorcycle , mr moe to return to his wife back home but the trip , as recounted by mr jenkins , has an enjoyably picaresque quality as our voyagers meet various africans en route , including people who show them remarkable kindness the travelers have some close calls with obstacles in the water , with guntoting soldiers , with crocodiles and hippopotamuses , kayakdestroying waterfalls , searing stretches of desert and swarms of killer bees , all of this told with aplomb by mr jenkins but the best feature of to timbuktu consists of mr jenkins s delight in the small and notsosmall elements of the african spectacle , which he treats with distanced , unsentimental , often esthetic appreciation the men will be mute and rigid as animals , mr jenkins writes of some people with river blindness he encounters along the banks of the niger , men whose blindness was not the only mysterious thing about them they have rough dusty legs of muscle and bodies of muscle and inscrutable faces one of the men uses a stick to draw a circle in the sand with wavy lines inside of it when we ask them questions , they will not respond to us , mr jenkins continues they will be blank human pillars supporting the weight of the african sky mike and i will go back to our boats out on the river we will slide into an eddy to wait for rick and john and wonder why the old man drew a picture in the sand that none of them could see but it was not drawn for them it was drawn for us later mr jenkins transforms a common sight into a moment of pure magic he watches as a girl of 8 or so appears along the river with a baby tied to her waist and a basin on her head her grace is effortless and shocking , mr jenkins writes she dips the gourd , gently raises it above her head out over the lip of the basin , and empties it she cannot see where she is pouring the water it is somewhere above her head , only her hand knows where nothing moves on her body but one arm she repeats the motion again and again it is a very large basin and the gourd is small and still later yet our traveler argues with a local chief about clitoridectomy , which the chief calmly justifies in the face of mr jenkins s rage the chief , who was wounded while serving in the french army during world war ii and spent a few years in england recovering , tells mr jenkins about his london landlady , a mrs rollins , who insisted to him that underneath we are all the same the story is the chief s indirect , yet ultimate defense of african custom do you know what i think \? the chief says i think mrs rollins needed to believe this i think all white people need to believe this i do n't know why it is not true we are not the same mr jenkins gives the impression of being a reliable narrator , so that when , stuck on endless stretches of the niger , paddling day after day , he is not afraid to admit that he is bored and dissatisfied there is a melancholy to this , the sense , implicit in mr jenkins s writing , that travel involves something futile , a disregard of pascal s epigram about all evil things coming from man s being unable to sit still in a room but it is just that touch of melancholy , of regret , of the hopelessness of the quest that gives to timbuktu its resonance photo mark jenkins \( dan moe william morrow \)
damariscotta , me , jan 4 biking over a bridge here last august , lisa knobel spotted a gold necklace on the ground and unexpectedly ignited a controversy over maine s law concerning lost valuables 'lost goods and stray beasts' are what this strange old law is about and it taxes someone finding something , said ms knobel , a warehouse supervisor at the maine yankee nuclear power plant , who may owe the town of damariscotta about 300 for her find i did the right thing , she added i notified the police they held on to it for a while no one claimed it i took it back and now they want to tax me that s just plain not right ms knobel , 32 , wanted the necklace for herself when no one had claimed it more than a month after she turned it in the town clerk told her she could be billed by the town for half the necklace s value if she took it she objected , setting off a storm of publicity and commentary i told them i'm not doing this , ms knobel said none of this about owing money was told to me when i turned it in it seems absurd and then the kicker was , the rules also said something about how , if i failed to turn over half the value of the necklace , they could go after me for the money oh , great ! i could become a criminal the law in question is believed to have been enacted in 1820 , when maine became a state it says if someone finds a lost item or animal worth more than 10 and turns it over to local authorities , hoping to claim it if the owner fails to , the finder must pay to advertise having found it the finder must also pay to have the item appraised and pay town processing charges in addition , the law says if the item is unclaimed for six months and the finder hopes to take possession of it , he or she must pay the town half the item s value the necklace has been informally valued at about 600 ms knobel , who lives in nobleboro , three miles north of damariscotta , currently has the necklace town officials returned it to her recently with the warning that she may be billed for the money damariscotta selectmen say the town may have no choice but to enforce the law but they , too , find fault with it i think the law is ridiculous , first selectman charles ault said it makes people want to steal what they find i hope we have better things to do with our time than pursue this also complicating ms knobel s situation is the state s abandoned property law , which says the state should hold lost items for five years and then , if they are unclaimed , sell them for now , the state s abandoned property manager , denise ducharme , said she would not press the issue i have to go with the law that s more clear , ms ducharme said and at this point , that s the stray beasts law ms knobel said she was waiting for the town to press charges against her , since she has already broken the law by failing to have the necklace officially appraised and failing to pay the town its share i would n't mind paying the town something , if i could designate where the money would go , like maybe the library or something , she said
it is wednesday , 8 pm , uptown , the opening night of the raucous comedy booty call at the nova cinema , 147th and broadway , in harlem there are no crowds outside the old movie house inside theater 1 , about 30 customers have gathered , mostly black young men waiting for the show to begin they sit through trailers for volcano , anaconda , murder at 1600 and hoodlum films that play well uptown , where the teenage boys , like teenagers everywhere , are inveterate moviegoers a few more patrons drift into the theater , dressed in puffy north face jackets and knit hats they are chased to their seats by the beam of the heavyduty flashlight wielded by an intimidating , large usher eighty minutes later the show is over the patrons have had a good time for their 650 , sometimes laughing so loud and so long considerable chunks of dialogue were lost but never mind it is a wednesday night in urban america , and another movie aimed at its young black audience has had a midweek opening timed to keep crowds , and trouble , to a minimum for the entertainment industry , films aimed at the young black urban market represent a threat and a promise a threat to safety but a promise of cash the wednesday opening , first used by new line cinema in october 1991 for the urban comedy house party 2 , and widely copied since , has become the preferred way of balancing the riskreward ratio across the country on its opening night , booty call took in only 750 , 000 from 1 , 272 screens but by sunday night , march 2 , it had brought in 8 million and come in fourth in the weekend boxoffice sweepstakes most important , the movie opened without incident most movies open on fridays to insure the largest possible audience for the first , crucial days of a film s release but in the case of certain black urban films , the studios try to diffuse the crowds and lessen the prospect of angry patrons being turned away at a soldout opening the goal is to avoid the gang violence and shootings that plagued the fridaynight premieres in march 1991 of new jack city and that july for boyz 'n the hood since then , films for a similar audience have tended to open in midweek the wednesday openings have not avoided trouble entirely , however official statistics are hard to come by , but last november , on the wednesdaynight premiere of set it off , a sort of girlz 'n the hood starring the rap artist queen latifah , there were , according to dale pollock , who produced the film with oren koules , three shootings , none inside the theater , but in parking lots outside the theaters fear of such violence has led to the wednesday opening , a custom little recognized by anyone outside the entertainment business movies like set it off have been redlined into their own universe , where the industry question what was the gross \? is followed almost immediately by was there any trouble \? because of their content and audience , such movies are given their own safe night of the week to open and sometimes provided with security guards , paid for by the studios there is heightened security with these films not for movies like 'waiting to exhale' but for some others , said jackie bazan , a black executive who runs bazan entertainment in jersey city theater owners are concerned mark gill , president of marketing and distribution for miramax films , a unit of walt disney which released rhyme and reason , a documentary about rap music that opened on wednesday , was at columbia pictures when it released boyz 'n the hood the total on 'boyz' was 33 wounded , 2 dead , mr gill , who is white , said those are serious numbers you have n't seen that again , because of the wednesday opening but jesus nova , a dominicanamerican who owns and manages the nova cinema , contends that the studios have become cautious to a fault they are happy to take your money , but too scared to meet you on a friday night , he insists , he can manage the opening of films like set it off i think it s now getting to the point where wednesday openings are hurting the studios , he said missing that friday harms the potential gross of the films and hurts the theaters although blacks represent only 125 percent of the population , they constitute 20 percent of american boxoffice receipts each year , according to industry data the young black male audience , in particular , is heavily represented but for films aimed squarely at young black men , said chris pula , president of theatrical marketing for warner brothers , a unit of time warner , there are a number of deaths and incidents , fights in the parking lot , setting the curtains on fire , ripping up seats , breaking toilets in restroom not always , of course such incidents do not seem to happen , for instance , at the magic johnson theaters , a blackowned theater chain where disruptive behavior and gang colors are prohibited the company , a joint venture between sony theaters and the nba star for whom it is named , operates in black or mixedethnicity neighborhoods and has theaters at the crenshaw plaza in southcentral los angeles , in atlanta , and is building one in houston the company has plans to move into new york in harlem and in jamaica , queens according to kenneth lombard , a black executive who is president of magic johnson theaters , the secret to opening any film is no tolerance for the things that disrupt the moviegoing experience at his theaters , he said , before the movie begins , a film of magic johnson comes on the screen , inviting the audience to leave their hostility and any gang loyalties outside
motorists in west palm beach , fla , were recently confronted by a billboard 100 yards from the wellington regional medical center why stop here \? it asked the sign advertised a nearby rival , the columbia palms west hospital , owned by the columbia hca healthcare corporation the billboard was a literal sign of the times from columbia , the world s largest health care company no other operator of hospitals has become so successful or so big so fast in the increasingly costconscious system of american medicine at the heart of that achievement is an aggressively competitive vision of medical care , one that applies the practices of corporate america to an industry still dominated by notforprofit institutions these practices include not only inyourface marketing , but hospital takeovers , costcutting and layoffs , volume purchasing , complex pricing strategies and large monetary incentives for managers who meet financial targets the formula has helped the company grow in a decade from nothing to 20 billion in revenues , with roughly 350 hospitals , 550 homehealthcare offices and scores of other medical businesses in 38 states columbia says it is a model for efficient , highquality health care and indeed , the company is widely admired for driving a longwasteful industry to change , and its strategies are often copied but now some of the very things that propelled columbia are troubling people inside and outside the company , in some cases producing a backlash the company intensely pressures managers to raise profits by cutting costs and increasing patient revenues administrators have been able to almost double their salaries through bonuses based almost entirely on meeting financial targets by contrast , about half of the industry does not offer bonuses , and hospitals that do usually tie them more closely to standards like mortality rates and programs that benefit the community some doctors , nurses and administrators , angered by rapid staff cuts that raise profits , are questioning whether care is being compromised an accusation that the company sharply disputes columbia markets itself with assertions that its prices are lower and its quality higher than its competitors' yet a computer analysis for the new york times shows that the median price paid for patients in columbia hospitals is 8 percent higher than the norm and there is no conclusive evidence that columbia s care is better than that provided elsewhere columbia has used bareknuckled competitive tactics once rarely seen in the hospital industry critics say the company can be unnecessarily ruthless and even petty when it does not get its way , from suing communities that reject its efforts to acquire hospitals to maintaining a skeletal hospital with only two inpatient beds , in order to avoid surrendering a valued operating license from san diego to providence , communities wary of columbia s hardball tactics have recently resisted its attempts to buy local hospitals on top of this , the company is the subject of several federal inquiries criminal investigators raided its operations in el paso two months ago and scores of federal agents have been interviewing doctors and others familiar with the company s practices around the country the federal agency that runs medicare is also investigating whether certain columbia hospitals have systematically overbilled the government by overstating the severity of the illnesses they treat it is also studying whether doctors who invest in columbia hospitals and regional health systems violate the law by referring patients to outpatient services , like home care , in which they have investments columbia executives dismiss criticism as anecdotal misinformation from disgruntled employees or others who do not understand the company they say that while columbia is aggressive , it plays fair richard l scott , chief executive of columbia , said his company was only responding to demands to curb runaway medical costs there s no way , as taxpayers , as employers , as employees , as individuals , people are going to pay what they paid in the past for health care , he said so if you say , 'ok , that s true , ' then we 've got to change a result , the company proclaims in advertisements , is health care that has never worked like this before the beginnings the entrepreneur as a maverick mr scott , 44 , is lean and driven , almost a personal model for his company he typically begins his days with 5 am workouts he neither smokes nor drinks i 've never heard him use a fourletter word , said david colby , a former chief financial officer with the company mr scott grew up in kansas city , mo , where his father was a truck driver and his mother worked , among other jobs , as a clerk at j c penney while in college , he made his first foray into business with his mother and brother , buying and reviving two kansas city doughnut shops after graduating from southern methodist university law school , he did legal work for hospital companies but he had other goals in 1987 , he created the columbia hospital corporation with richard e rainwater , a texas financier each invested 125 , 000 and sought money on wall street mr scott was the operations man , although he had never run a hospital

to the editor the last line of frederick allen s very interesting review of benson bobrick s angel in the whirlwind \( july 6 \) caught my eye allen quotes an unnamed historian as stating , all the men who signed the declaration of independence died in bed for the sake of historical accuracy , i am moved to point out that at least one of the signers , and perhaps two , did not thomas lynch of south carolina died at the age of 30 when his ship sank in a storm en route to the west indies , and button gwinnett of georgia was mortally wounded in a duel with the general who was chosen over him for command of the georgia militia of course , allen is making the point , quite correctly , that none of the signers died on the scaffold or in front of a firing squad in several cases , though , this was a near thing arthur middleton , thomas heyward and edward rutledge were captured by the british when they occupied charleston in 1780 , as was george walton of georgia in the fall of savannah fortunately for them , the british chose to regard them as prisoners of war rather than traitors however , richard stockton of new jersey was captured by the british in 1777 and imprisoned he died four years later , apparently as the result of the severe treatment he received at the hands of his captors meyer l block east northport , ny
ta khmau , cambodia , feb 9 when he was a police officer here in kandal province , criminal investigations were straightforward we beat the suspects , ouk vandath said if we wanted to get water from that glass over there , he added by way of illustration , pointing to a nearby table , we beat it until it gave us water without equipment , without training , without an education in legal procedures or human rights , the police force is the first point of contact in a primitive judicial process from arrests to trials to prisons that has operated for years with few rules or resources like so much in this broken and struggling country , the justice system is only beginning to recover from the mass killings of lawyers , doctors , teachers , monks and other educated people and the destruction of government institutions , including the courts , carried out by the radical communist khmer rouge from 1975 to 1979 they were among at least hundreds of thousands and possibly as many as two million people who died during the khmer rouge years when the united nations helped to set up a democratic government here in 1993 , there were only about five lawyers left in this country of seven million with the help of several international organizations , cambodia is now beginning to develop a small corps of lawyers and judges , to train its police officers in proper procedures and to revive the rudiments of a working legal system the task that the nation faces is an increasingly common one in the emerging democracies of asia , africa and latin america , where putting the rule of law into operation is a fundamental challenge they had to start a legal system literally from scratch , said francis j james , an american lawyer who helped to found a local nonprofit group called legal aid of cambodia no more beating , no more cigarette burns , no more hitting with a rifle butt you could clear out the prisons today if you reviewed the cases on the basis of procedural error when i came here in 1994 , the courthouses were in ruins some still had bullet holes , and birds were flying in and out of the buildings in the prisons there were people who had been completely forgotten nobody knew why they were there or whether they had already completed their sentences a year ago , mr ouk vandath , who had become increasingly uneasy about the beatings by his fellow officers , began a new career as one of a small corps of barefoot public defenders working in the innovative kandal provincial court , where prisoners are now assured of receiving a basic defense he has enrolled in cambodia s newly revived law school , which will graduate its first class of 170 students later this year mr ouk vandath was trained for his public defender s role by karen tse , 32 , a lawyer from los angeles she works as one of five expatriate judicial mentors in several provinces in a program run by the united nations center for human rights that trains lawyers , judges , prosecutors and police officers we look for areas where there are gaps , ms tse said , and we tailor our training to fit the needs for example , there are some defenses that are basic in law selfdefense , duress , necessity it s like a little light goes on and they come and ask us is this a selfdefense case \? progress here has been measured in small steps first , a bulletin board where court dates are posted for the public , then file cabinets for keeping court records , then permission for public defenders to attend the questioning of defendants and now , occasionally , the guilty looks that ms tse observes from police officers when they deliver a defendant bearing the signs of a beating in one significant step , she persuaded the chief prosecutor , chheng phath , to send arresting officers out of his office when he conducted his initial interviews with defendants the police would give the defendant the evil eye and intimidate him to give me certain answers , mr chheng phath said in the past the police arrested , the police detained , the police convicted some of them are angry about the changes but i tell them we have to change other countries are going to the moon , but we still use oxcarts the crowning achievements in kandal are the recent opening of a small , whitewashed room where defendants can speak with a public defender and the inauguration , scheduled for friday , of the country s first arraignment court , where a defendant can hear the charges against him , be advised of his rights and enter his plea along with the other courthouse improvements , these were financed by the united nations development program the arraignment court is a landmark , mr james said that is something that has not seen the light of day in cambodia the court s chief judge , hy sophea , hopes it will help him make his name as a judicial innovator if it is successful here , i will take it around the country and spread it through all the provinces , he said none of cambodia s 70 judges have sophisticated legal training , although a dozen or so have studied abroad in places like vietnam , east germany , ukraine and kazakstan threats and bribery are part of their working conditions , even under the new government one person who works with the legal system here , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said only the poor received a semblance of justice , for better or for worse the rich routinely buy their freedom and officials said one of two female inmates at kandal prison , nom saroeun , 19 , who was convicted of selling a girl into prostitution , was due to be released soon by judicial officials , not on legal grounds but on the basis of her ethereal beauty the prison warden , moung somath , is another of ms tse s converts to his surprise , he said , his prisoners became easier to handle when she persuaded him to permit them some exercise , reading matter and a better diet he has agreed to let more light into the cells , to erect screens to keep out the rain and to plant a large vegetable garden that prisoners are allowed to tend but conditions remain primitive and , like the police force and the court system , the prison struggles with a lack of equipment mr moung somath said his greatest needs were a new roof for one of the three crumbling cellblocks and a vehicle to transport prisoners to court it is humiliating to them when we have to take them to court handcuffed on the back of a motorcycle , he said it is with small details like this that people like ms tse hope to plant the seeds of a working justice system we started off talking about the standard police interview , she said nothing out of the ordinary just three basic steps introduce everybody in the room by name and rank , tell the prisoner why he is there , read him his rights this may seem overly simple , she said , but it may be having some effect it s a lot harder to beat people once you 've told them they have the right not to be tortured , she said photos while they remain primitive , conditions at kandal prison have improved somewhat under the influence of foreign justice experts \( pg a1 \) nom saroeun , 19 , is in kandal prison for selling a girl into prostitution the authorities who run the cambodian prison are being taught about proper legal procedure under a united nations program \( seth mydans the new york times \) \( pg a10 \) map of cambodia shows the location of ta khmau in ta khmau , the police are being taught not to beat suspects \( pg a10 \)
been there , done that , won that and there s no time like the present to do it again monica seles and andre agassi , both former united states open champions , are convinced that their stars are finally on the rise again and are tired of talking about how much more intrepid they were in their selfdescribed former lives back then seles had not been stabbed and was fearless , and agassi was balancing grand slam titles with celebrity now both are trying to get on with the business of reasserting , and reinventing , themselves on the grand slam front yesterday at the open , the secondseeded seles and the unseeded agassi punched in for their assignments at arthur ashe stadium and reclaimed a level of competitiveness that left their opponents drained , bedraggled and wishing they had caught the two revivalists on an off day though seles allowed the ninthseeded mary pierce to dictate the power plays in their opening set , the twotime open champion turned testy in the second up went the volume of her grunts , up went the velocity of her serves , and out went pierce , 16 , 62 , 62 after giving seles all manner of trouble in the opening set , pierce caused none in the next two once she s on a roll , she does n't let up , said pierce , who admitted that the hints of vintage seles the forehands jackhammered down the line , the nasty angles carved by her backhands were daunting over all , she s not as aggressive as she was before , but she still hits amazing shots seles , who is 23 , conceded that she does not have the sting that took her to the no 1 ranking and brought her eight grand slam titles while she was still a teenager back then she was on automatic pilot and unafraid of her destination these days , after the 1993 attack that changed her life and effectively cut her career in two , she does not have the luxury of thoughtlessness i pretty much was n't thinking , seles said of her early years , when she terrorized opponents with her twofisted shots and singleminded ambition i do n't think i would have started thinking if somebody would n't have stabbed me in the back sitting on the tennis court during a match i still believe i have the same mindset , but once somebody does that , they take your feeling of security away obviously the level i played was very different at that point , but that s the level i 'll hopefully get back , and maybe even better agassi has not yet set his sights on being better than he was before , but knowing he won the open while unseeded in 1994 has convinced him he can reprise that feat this year yesterday he roared past the australian mark woodforde , who confessed to being frightened by the quality of agassi s returns after completing his 62 , 62 , 64 rout , agassi proclaimed himself back in the grip of the tennis gods he regularly defies the fact is , i'm extreme in what i do , and my priorities , and when something shifts , my intensity does with it , agassi said i'm trying to give all to everything in my life , and it does n't seem to do anything but drain you , so i 've responded by focusing my attention intensely at different times barbra streisand was n't far offbase when she suggested agassi must be full of zen how else to explain him \?

it was a thursday night , hot and steamy , and masjid alfarah had no airconditioning still , the threestory building was packed , its 60 or 70 visitors spilling out onto the tribeca sidewalks , mingling with the rest of the evening crowd on west broadway , just below canal street , where most of the former warehouse and industrial buildings now house restaurants and bars but these visitors had not come downtown to just drink or dine masjid alfarah , meaning divine ease , is a mosque like millions of others around the world , the faithful were there to celebrate the birthday of the prophet mohammed the participants at masjid alfarah are sufis , members of a mystical branch of islam they are led by a woman , sheikha fariha friedrich , which is unheard of in traditional islamic circles , and many of the 150 members are aging baby boomers who are converts from christianity and judaism , which gives their gathering something of a woodstockrevival feeling masjid alfarah itself possesses none of the architectural features , like domes and minarets , usually associated with mosques tucked anonymously between a shuttered luncheonette and an upscale french restaurant , it looks like all the other small buildings in its neighborhood , with only a set of stainedglass windows , barely visible from the street , to distinguish it it has been on west broadway since 1985 , after five years in soho the order also runs sufi books , which has been just down the street since 1992 sufi is an ancient arabic word for the woolen garments worn by the first practitioners of sufism , which began along with islam itself in the seventh century sufis are technically sunnites , as are the majority of muslims , and there are hundreds of sufi orders members of the west broadway mosque , called dervishes , follow the teachings of muzaffer ozak , who brought the order to the united states in 1979 ann everds , the bookstore manager , said sufis draw upon islam and other influences , including buddhism and mystical jewish practices , in their search for a more personal relationship with god than is offered by traditional islam their numbers are small when compared with the many americans who have been drawn to traditional islam in recent years mrs friedrich puts membership in her order at perhaps 500 for the whole of north america mrs friedrich said there was no particular reason why tribeca was chosen for the site , except that a previous mosque was in soho , so the area was familiar , and real estate was affordable she said the mosque has good relations with neighbors , including officers in the first precinct , who provided protection after the 1993 trade center bombing , when antimuslim sentiment rose it s an excellent location , said maryam ashki , a performance artist who moved from chicago to new york this year to study with mrs friedrich historically , sufis have been artists and unconventional people with a lot of creativity down here , we fit right in bernard stamler photo stainedglass windows are a distinguishing feature of the building \( frances roberts for the new york times \)

shuttle diplomacy by president clinton s special envoy here , bill richardson , washington s representative to the united nations mr richardson said there were no conditions and no established agenda for the talks , although just hours earlier mr kabila had refused to meet unless mr mobutu s immediate resignation was assured even late today , mr mobutu clung to a refusal to meet on the ship , saying instead that he would meet mr kabila in neighboring gabon neither was there an agreement on a ceasefire , mr richardson said , something the envoy had said was a top priority , but which mr kabila , whose army of teenagers now faces no more major military obstacles on its long march to kinshasa , was quick to reject even though mr mobutu resisted mr kabila s demand that he step down immediately , the military reality of the situation , with rebel forces nearing the capital , is forcing the president to negotiate the terms of his departure although mr kabila could take power by force , he has apparently agreed to a meeting with the understanding that his image , battered by recent accusations that his troops have killed defenseless refugees , would be enhanced by trying to talk rather than simply overrunning kinshasa the negotiations are to take place under united nations auspices aboard the south african vessel , the outeniqua , in international waters off gabon several african heads of state are expected to be present , including president nelson mandela of south africa mr richardson said explicitly that he would attend the opening of the talks but would not stay through the session in announcing the breakthrough tonight , mr richardson said this is a historic occasion that we are hopeful will lead to a peaceful transition in zaire diplomats caution , however , that the prospects for successful negotiations are uncertain at best the agreement by the two leaders to meet could reduce the prospect for a violent struggle for control of a crowded , panicky capital of five million people in the past , kinshasa has been the scene of looting and rioting by government troops , who often have little training and even less compensation , and in this war , government troops have often fled before the rebels even entered some cities it was mr mobutu s 27yearold son , nzanga mobutu , his spokesman and lately his most trusted adviser , who ultimately persuaded his father to agree to talks on board the ship through much of the day today , mr mobutu had publicly rejected the idea of talks anywhere but in gabon mr mobutu , 66 , who has been weakened by prostate cancer , had invoked his frail health to refuse the shipboard meeting , saying it would require a lengthy helicopter ride , according to diplomats who participated in the negotiations at the same time mr richardson , meeting with mr kabila on tuesday night in the southern rebelheld city of lubumbashi , was unable to get him to accept gabon as a site officials involved in the talks said mr kabila invoked fears of being assassinated in gabon , which has french military bases and has close ties with paris from the beginning of zaire s war seven months ago , mr kabila s alliance of democratic forces for the liberation of congo , which now controls twothirds of this vast country , has accused france of supporting mr mobutu , and of trying to organize international intervention to prevent mr kabila from taking power mr richardson s successful effort to secure mr mobutu s agreement to the meeting came after one of the most dramatic touches in the 48 hours of hectic shuttle diplomacy returning to a tense kinshasa this afternoon after having met with mr kabila , mr richardson s raced with sirenscreaming motorcycle outriders through streets filled with curious bystanders gathering with his team at the home of the united states ambassador to zaire , daniel h simpson , mr richardson awaited a previously unannounced visit by mr mobutu s son entering the house for brief talks with the president s son , diplomats said they were able to impress upon him that there was no option other than to accept the meeting on the ship putting off the talks , diplomats argued , would mean a certain military victory by mr kabila s forces and potentially widespread loss of life and destruction in kinshasa the younger mr mobutu emerged from the house grimfaced , jumped into a fourwheeldrive vehicle and sped to his father s hilltop residence overlooking the rapids of the congo river announcing the agreement on talks tonight on the steps of mr mobutu s heavily guarded villa , as large , peacocklike birds cawed loudly on the lawn , mr richardson praised mr mobutu s statesmanship , saying he had submitted to mr kabila s choice out of a view that we must move ahead with a peaceful , inclusive transition

professional athletes are often perceived as rich , spoiled and out of control and why should that be surprising \? tales of flagrant misconduct are frequent dennis rodman kicks a television cameraman in the groin in the latest of a series of his outrageous acts david wells , newly signed to a 135 million contract with the yankees , breaks his pitching hand in a fight outside a bar roberto alomar spits in an umpire s face and then says the umpire has become embittered by the death of his son lawrence phillips and christian peter of the twotime collegiate champion nebraska football team are placed on court probation after engaging in separate attacks against women , but are signed to contracts with national football league teams , phillips with the st louis rams and peter with the giants michael irvin of the super bowl champion dallas cowboys pleads no contest to a felony charge of cocaine possession and four of his teammates fail drug tests despite the regularity of such acts , the punishment meted out rarely matches the offense rodman s 11game suspension last friday for kicking the cameraman might seem an exception but it is only 11 games out of an 82game season that is a prelude to the playoffs , and the loss of pay is only oneeighth of his 9 million salary that the league thinks of this as a tough sentence is only an indication of the leniency shown to rodman in 16 different episodes over the past five years a review of player contracts and collective bargaining agreements in baseball , basketball and football shows why any number of criminal events cocaine use , domestic violence , sexual assaults , fighting rarely result in significant punishment and often fail to match the offense complex playermanagement agreements have dramatically changed how players are disciplined sports commissioners , who once were empowered to make unilateral decisions regarding discipline , have seen their authority eroded the power to discipline is now a product of contract , said john weistart , a professor of sport and law at duke university law school but weistart said the issue is broader than that , attributing it to a fundamental change in our society s perceptions as to what is a serious offense forty years ago we talked more about strong moral behavior my hypothesis is that the moral quality has almost disappeared from the equation in the past , when owners or commissioners were in virtual control of the games , the players were lucky if they received more than a brisk starchamber proceeding no notice no lawyer no hearing often misconduct did not become public because the news media did not publicize it but when it did , discipline was meted out without the niceties of due process take the case of jack molinas in 1954 , he was a rookie for the fort wayne pistons he was summarily suspended by the national basketball association despite the league s requirements for a hearing after he admitted placing bets on his team his efforts at reinstatement through the federal courts failed , in part because courts typically will not interfere with the actions of a private sports organization contrast molinas s situation with that of steve howe , a former yankee pitcher who was suspended from baseball six times between 1982 and 1988 for drug use after his arrest in 1991 for cocaine possession , commissioner fay vincent imposed a lifetime ban , the strongest sanction however , under the collective bargaining agreement , howe was entitled to appeal the punishment to a grievance arbitrator the arbitrator overruled the commissioner , saying howe had not received help for an underlying psychiatric disorder , which turned out to be attention deficit hyperactive disorder in major league professional sports , discipline comes from two fronts either it is imposed by the commissioner or the team owner or both , or it comes by way of administrative sanction specified in the collective bargaining agreement on the administrative side , players are routinely sanctioned for what amounts to parking violations these are typically fines for being late , for missing practice , for missing transportation or a curfew these infractions are spelled out in the collective bargaining contract in the nfl , for example , the fines are in the 250 range , a trivial amount for players who are paid a minimum salary of 196 , 000 and often make millions not all fines are as trivial under the nba s labor agreement , for example , an unexcused absence from preseason training camp costs a player 5 , 000 a day commissioners still have strong discretionary powers to impose discipline in certain areas typically these powers fall under the best interests of the game provisions best interest clauses are subject to interpretation and a players' union may often have a view that differs from the commissioner if a commissioner believes a player s conduct has a detrimental impact on the game , the commissioner has the right to order sanctions for example , in the nba , the commissioner may suspend a player if his conduct does not conform to morality or fair play or does not comply at all times with federal , state and local laws
a combination of sleet , rain and snow covered the roads and highways of the new york city region with a thin sheet of ice yesterday , causing widespread traffic delays and scores of accidents during the afternoon rush , police and traffic officials said many sections of the long island expressway , the belt parkway in brooklyn and queens , and sunrise highway in suffolk county were periodically closed while icy sections were sanded and salted major problems were also reported on the cross bronx expressway the most serious accident occurred on the seafordoyster bay expressway near exit 3 in seaford , li , where one motorist was hospitalized in critical condition after his car slid off the road and overturned it s treacherous out there , and there s lots of black ice , which is hard to see , said sgt edward vanderhyde of the nassau county highway patrol the roads in general are pretty icy and we 've received reports of a lot of minor accidents of the fenderbender variety , he said luckily , most of them are not serious the state police reported at least 50 accidents caused by icy conditions in suffolk county , where traffic officials ordered various sections of the sunrise highway and the long island expressway closed for brief periods while the pavement was sanded and salted it made for some traffic tieups , but it also made for safer roads , said officer santo distefano , a spokesman for the suffolk county police none of the closures really lasted very long , but we had to do it , because we were getting accidents all over the place the same icy conditions plagued the streets and highways in new york city as officials prepared for new year s eve , fearful that the freezing temperatures and slippery roads would create extremely hazardous conditions , especially for those who drink and drive cars began sliding and bumping into one another shortly after 11 am , according to patrick muldowney , a spokesman for the new york city department of transportation reports of accidents have been coming in all day , including a fivecar fender bender on a westbound lane of the 59th street bridge , mr muldowney said fortunately there have been no serious injuries black ice has forced road closings all over the city , he said for example , the belt parkway has had several scattered closings he said the roads were being reopened as soon as the sanitation people can get in and throw some sand and salt down
for a parent of a new , young driver , perhaps the only thing more agonizing than handing the car keys to a teenager is handing a sizable check to an auto insurance company in fact , adding a minor to an auto policy can double the cost , and some parents will do just about anything to curb those increases , from fibbing about the miles driven in a year to lying about their address to simply not reporting that they have a teenage driver in the household we know that unreported new drivers are a problem , but it is difficult to estimate how many , said steve witmer , a spokesman for state farm insurance it is also often unclear what will happen if you do n't report your teenager to your insurer the big fear for parents , of course , is that junior will run the cherokee through the front window of tiffany s and the insurance company will ask , junior who \? that is a legitimate worry insurers insist that all drivers in a household be listed on a policy , and there are court rulings backing their decisions not to pay when an undeclared driver has an accident but insurance companies are also settling lawsuits from customers who contend that their policies as written cover teenagers , so there is no need to report them to insurers so what s the truth \? your insurance company probably wo n't tell you this , but under most circumstances , junior would be covered the insurer may send you a nasty letter or even cancel your coverage , but it would still cover your child s accident we would pay the claim , said john walmsley , a spokesman for usaa , an insurance company in san antonio our member , for sure , would get a letter saying do n't let it happen again allstate also said it would pay up , as did nationwide insurance and state farm why do insurance companies pay if they do n't have to \? these companies spend a lot on advertising that portrays them as a member of the family , said steven goldstein of the insurance information institute , a trade group in new york the last thing they want to be seen as is a corporation trying to hurt parents who are struggling to raise teenagers image aside , companies generally have a right to penalize fibbers they can go back and assess the premiums customers should have paid the insurers can also raise the premium on a new policy , or decline to renew they can also accuse a policyholder of fraud and refuse to pay , which is more likely after bigger accidents typically , firms do n't blanch when it comes to small claims , but when zeros are added to the dollar figure , they rethink their position , said lorelie masters , managing partner in the washington office of anderson , kill olick , a law firm that often represents policyholders ms masters noted a 1979 case in which a 20yearold who was not listed as a driver on his parents' policy drove his car into a light pole , two gates and a guardrail , causing 17 , 123 in damage the insurance company denied benefits because the family had said their son would not drive the car a chicago court agreed that the insurer did not have to pay the issue of when a parent is legally required to tell an insurance company about a teenage driver has long been murky in december , the cna insurance companies settled a classaction suit by agreeing to repay 31 million to about 15 , 000 policyholders whose rates increased when they added coverage for a teenage driver in the middle of a policy period lawyers for the policyholders said that the way the policy was written , all parents and children under 21 were already covered , whether or not the children were licensed the lawyers argued that rates could not increase until the oneyear or sixmonth policy was renewed they were charged for insurance they already had , said raymond simon of simon spitalli , the chicago law firm that represented the policyholders , who added that other law firms had won similar settlements so insurance companies have been rewriting contracts to close that loophole like other companies faced with these suits , cna says it already has that right to my knowledge no company has ever admitted there was a problem with the language of the policy , and to my knowledge , none of these suits has ever gone to court , said damian sepanik , general counsel for cna , which will pay an average of 147 to policyholders who seek reimbursement the company said it settled the case because it was cheaper than going to court a study by the insurance research council , a trade group in wheaton , ill , indicated that many americans are willing to lie to lower their rates about 20 percent of the 1 , 987 adults polled found it acceptable , to get a lower insurance rate , to list an older adult as the driver of a car actually driven by a minor another 23 percent said it was acceptable to lie about where the car was kept , and 32 percent said it was acceptable to underreport the miles driven annually most people negotiate in their minds the degree of acceptable cheating , mr goldstein of the insurance information institute said there are always people who will get away with it , but why take the chance \? william d smith of kenmore , ny , near buffalo , faced the reporting issue when it came time to insure his 17yearold son i heard from some acquaintances that you did n't have to tell the insurance company , mr smith said some said , 'i never told them , and as far as i am concerned my kid is someone whom i lend my car to' mr smith decided to insure his son , william , anyway , which added about 535 to his previous 1 , 545ayear payment to the auto mutual insurance company of america i decided to bite the bullet and report the new driver , he said i just thought if he got in an accident there could be trouble there are legitimate ways to lower the cost of insuring a teenager many insurance companies give discounts to good students and to graduates of certified drivereducation schools delaying when a child starts to drive , say , to age 17 from 16 , can also save a lot of money statistics from the insurance institute of highway safety indicate that waiting a year also decreases the probability of an accident the group s figures show that a 16yearold is 42 percent more likely to have an accident than a 17yearold insurance companies say they have an easy solution to the problem of undeclared young drivers getting the names and birth dates of all children in a family when first issuing insurance to the parents this being the computer age , we store this information , said bob sohovich , a spokesman for nationwide insurance and when the time comes , we ask if there is a new driver in the household photo although their annual insurance premium jumped 535 , william d and patricia smith of kenmore , ny , did not hesitate to add coverage for their 17yearold son , william \( mike groll for the new york times \) graph dangerous years shows the percentage of licensed drivers by age group who were involved in a traffic accident in 1990 \( source insurance institute for highway safety \)
frankfurt , april 26 leo kirch has taken many big gambles in the course of building up the german media conglomerate that carries his name , and he has rarely been wrong but the reclusive bavarian billionaire never placed a bet quite as big as the one he has made on digital paytelevision in germany , and there are many signs that he is sweating more now than ever before the kirch group , based in munich , has invested well in excess of 1 billion into a oneyearold digital television service called df1 , which beams about 25 channels of programming and payperview movies into homes by satellite but the service has attracted only 40 , 000 customers so far , about onefifth as many as it had hoped by this point industry experts believe the group needs one million to two million customers to break even by contrast , the french paytelevision company canal plus has signed more than 300 , 000 subscribers in france for its new digital service in just over a year and is moving ahead with similar systems in scandinavia , italy , poland and spain at the center of the kirch group s problems is a stalemate involving bertelsmann ag , germany s biggest publishing and broadcast company , and deutsche telekom ag , the german telephone and cable television company each company has visions of dominating the future of television , and none of them can quite manage without the others but instead of collaborating , the three are essentially paralyzing each other with machiavellian machinations of fabulous intricacy the stalemate boils down to programming and access to customers the kirch group controls german rights to a huge library of television shows and movies but bertelsmann and deutsche telekom each has a crucial base of customers such problems are not new in the entertainment industry , where big companies routinely find themselves bosom buddies in one venture and blood rivals in another but the stagnation is costing mr kirch millions of dollars kirch appears to be over a barrel , a recent report by credit suisse first boston said , concluding that the company faces formidable pressure on several fronts besides the money spent on movie rights , the report noted , the kirch group has also signed commitments to buy one million television settop boxes from the nokia corporation of finland compounding those problems are difficulties in the german market most households already get about 30 channels of television through cable or satellite dishes that pick up a wide range of broadcast television networks beamed in analog form that has dampened interest among consumers to pay more money for the bonus of payperview movies or a handful of new channels now the kirch group is hunting for new partners and new capital including possible partnerships with american companies and it is continuing to negotiate , although fitfully , with both of its rivals both the kirch group and deutsche telekom executives have said in recent days that they are optimistic about reaching a pact , which would allow them to transmit the df1 service over deutsche telekom s cable television network that reaches 12 million german households but deutsche telekom s chairman , ron sommer , made it clear in an interview that the companies are still wrestling over basic issues of control the kirch group s precise financial situation remains one of europe s bestkept secrets but there are many signs that the company is under intense pressure rupert murdoch s news corporation , which owns the fox television network and several big satellite television ventures , backed out of a plan to invest several hundred million dollars in df1 last month and an attempt to line up more than 500 million in loans from a governmentowned bank in bavaria collapsed two weeks ago after politicians accused the kirch group of getting special treatment kirch group executives now openly acknowledge that they are looking for new partners and new capital the kirch group is said to have held talks with general motors' directv , the biggest american directtohome satellite television service , as well as with the general electric company , the parent of nbc kirch group executives refused to discuss talks with particular companies we are a very interesting partner for everyone who wants to come into the european television market , said jan mojto , the kirch group s general manager , in an interview mr mojto brushed aside speculation that the kirch group was under pressure , saying the company has come through similar experiences many times before leo kirch always took risks and went far ahead of other people in anticipation of future developments , he said the kirch group , one of europe s biggest media conglomerates , owns three german television networks , as well as big stakes in paytelevision ventures in germany , italy and elsewhere in europe moreover , its vast libraries of television programming from hogan s heroes to star trek represent its main weapon in the push to roll out digital television the problem , of course , is that bertelsmann and deutsche telekom both hold several other vital elements for success the weapons in the struggle here include the television rights to soccer games \( owned by bertelsmann \) payperview rights to hit movies \( kirch group \) access to 12 million german households that subscribe to cable \( deutsche telekom \) , and control over germany s existing paytelevision service , which is analogous to home box office \( kirch group , bertelsmann and others \) bertelsmann now holds the livebroadcast rights to most german soccer games bertelsmann also owns a big share , with the kirch group and canal plus , in germany s existing pay television service , called premier the kirch group has been pressuring bertelsmann for more than a year to let premier become part of the df1 offering , because it would give df1 much better access to the 14 million people already willing to pay extra for premium television but bertelsmann has consistently refused , and no decision can be made about premier without its consent meanwhile , kirch group executives desperately want to transmit df1 over cable lines to deutsche telekom s 12 million customers , because relatively few households get their signals through satellite dishes but deutsche telekom has thus far insisted on being more than just a conduit for mr kirch s service american television and movie companies have a big interest in seeing the stalemate resolved , because payperview services could represent the next big channel of distribution after videocassettes for their products i think they will work it out , said jeffrey schlesinger , president of warner brothers international i do n't think any of them are going to get

fort lauderdale , fla , march 1 for 15 minutes , cal ripken takes ground balls to his glove side last season , ripken was removed for a pinchrunner in the eighth inning of a onerun game , marking the first time in the major leagues that he had been taken out with the outcome undecided for 15 minutes , cal ripken takes ground balls backhanded last season , ripken was temporarily moved to third base , ending his major league record string of 2 , 216 games at shortstop for 10 minutes , cal ripken fields bunts last season , ripken was joined in clubhouse controversy by bobby bonilla , whose words spoke louder than his bat when he blamed his poor early performance on his position as designated hitter , and by the nonetoopeaceful coexistence of mike mussina , the no 1 pitcher , and pat dobson , the pitching coach bonilla and dobson are no longer with the baltimore orioles ripken , after 15 years , is no longer the orioles' shortstop this spring , he is taking all of those grounders and bunts at third base mike bordick is the shortstop he was one of three frontline players \( outfielder eric davis and pitcher jimmy key are the others \) the orioles added in the off season to fortify themselves for a summer duel with the yankees besides finding out if they can rid themselves of their runnerup status , the orioles must learn if they have shed their status as a dysfunctional family there was a running battle of comments in the press , somewhat goodnatured , but nonetheless with an edge to it , peter angelos , the orioles' owner , said recently , discussing the dispute between bonilla and manager davey johnson i do n't think the team leveled off and started playing together until bobby was in right field and a lot of the conflict between the two had subsided i know bonilla gets more of the blame , but i beg to differ i think most of the provocation was coming from the other direction that s because davey is a combative guy he does n't back off i find bonilla to be a good team player and a good personality i heard that was n't the case in new york , but in baltimore you could n't ask for a better guy pat gillick , the general manager , offered a different view of bonilla , now a member of the florida marlins adding those three guys and moving those other two guys off the club will be a plus , gillick said , referring to bonilla and david wells , the pitcher now with the yankees not that i do n't like wells or i do n't like bobby , but there s a little more businesslike approach to what key and bordick do the way they go about their business is more serious and determined bobby and david are good guys , but they 've kind of got their own style it does n't necessarily upset anybody , but it bothers them it s more of an irritant johnson himself was an irritant to angelos and , angelos believed , to some of the players the owner , in fact , was viewed as having created an impression after last season that he no longer wanted johnson as the orioles' manager but angelos said that impression was exaggerated i had some concerns about certain critical comments being made publicly about one player or another , angelos said by telephone from baltimore i think if there s going to be criticism of a player or coworker or cohort , that s best done privately we all sometimes slip and say things we should n't say , but this was happening frequently davey says he does it because he thinks it enhances performance i do n't agree with it back then , there were negative comments made about chris hoiles , mussina , bonilla , all of which i found to be totally without basis i thought no constructive purpose was being served johnson , who during the off season talked out the owner s differences with him , thought there was i do n't rip players , johnson said , pausing from his preparations for the next day s exhibition game sometimes you say he s better than that or he s capable of being better than that that s not a rip that s a roundabout way of saying he s not doing the things he s capable of doing guess who s at third \? they call him the streak can the orioles' hierarchy agree on anything \? well , ripken as the third baseman , for at least one thing they all believe he will be a good one and that the switch will make the orioles a stronger team but because the move involves ripken , the only man who outlasts the energizer bunny , the orioles will once again be scrutinized for daily dysfunctional developments johnson tried to make the move last year , ending ripken s shortstop streak at 2 , 216 consecutive games the player who pushed ripken to third base was manny alexander johnson had used him earlier in the season as an eighthinning pinchrunner for ripken in a close game against the yankees ripken telegraphed his displeasure with the former move by refusing to comment about it after the 15inning loss for six successive games in midjuly , ripken played third , and alexander , a young , unestablished dominican , played short the experiment failed alexander committed more errors \( two \) than he had hits \( one \) , and he struck out 9 times in 18 atbats he did it all without a word or any other kind of encouragement from ripken he resented it , a member of the orioles said of ripken all of his friends resented it except for the latin guys and the coaches , no one gave manny the time of day ripken , however , said the perception of his reaction was wrong

mamaroneck they belong to different species they are separated by years but frances racusin , 93 , and the young pet cockatiels at the sarah r neuman nursing home here definitely communicate on a recent day , mrs racusin put her nose to the cage and talked soothingly to the grayandyellow birds , which seemed agitated by a sudden flurry of visitors ok , ok , nice birds , pretty birds , pretty , pretty , pretty birds , she said in soft , low tones what are you doing \? do you want to come closer to me \? i love you , you know that as she spoke , the birds did , indeed , become calmer ruffled feathers smoothed frenzied motion subsided small , bright avian eyes and large , bespectacled human ones locked gazes they respond to me , mrs racusin said you stop and think it s miraculous , they have a brain and they use that brain they use it to communicate the cockatiels are part of a pet therapy program that also includes visits from volunteers' dogs and another bird , an extraordinarily tame peach moluccan cockatoo but unlike those creatures , which come and go , the cockatiels have been designated permanent residents one pair , in the wing for people with alzheimer s disease , is cared for by staff members the patients can do little more with them than watch their antics the other duo , however , is in the lobby of the pavilion , where residents some in their late 90 s function with minimal , if any , assistance , are completely alert and do such things as take trips to theaters and museums for them especially for mrs racusin the birds are almost like children , creatures to respect , nurture and love the cockatiels have become part of the family for many of our residents , said helen morgan , director of therapeutic recreation frances , for example , feels very , very responsible for them deborah marks kahn , assistant director of therapeutic recreation , added these birds are quite smart they relate well to people equally important is whether the people relate well to them dr john r pisciotta , a veterinarian with the rye harrison veterinary hospital who has a special interest in birds , said they are sensitive , intelligent and , in some ways , very delicate not only is it crucial to provide a bird with proper diet and environment but one should also try to understand its behavior some researchers are now saying that certain parrots actually have exhibited reasoning ability , he said none of which surprises mrs racusin since the cockatiels , which are members of the parrot family , arrived last summer , she has been reading books about their natural history and care , cleaning their cage , feeding them and overseeing the latest developments the laying of eggs and hatching of babies eight weeks ago , she suggested attaching a wooden brooder box to the cage shortly afterward , she observed pete and repeat , as they are named , mating not long after that , inside the brooder box , there were eggs that both the male and the female birds took turns warming and , three weeks after the first egg was laid , the tiny , downy , chirping chicks appeared do you know how the babies get fed \? mrs racusin asked rhetorically i feed the parents this special formula food , then the mother regurgitates it up for the little ones to eat little cockatiels mature quickly , however , and eight weeks after the three youngsters were born , they were eating on their own and ready to be placed in new homes mrs racusin and her friends leonora flam , 98 , and paula trachtenberg , 94 , watched as two of the young ones were transferred , individually , to separate cages belonging to the staff members , who each agreed to adopt one bird mrs flam said she would miss them mrs trachtenberg recalled her own pet birds of many years ago , and mrs racusin was quiet , her expression solemn and concerned i'm worried they 'll get lonely , she said the third young bird , named spotty for his speckled feathers , is supposed to be donated to a children s hospital , but , if that plan fails , he will need a home i hope spotty goes to someone who understands and knows how to care for him he s the youngest and the smallest , mrs racusin said mrs racusin and the others will still have pete and repeat and , she observed , repeat has already laid another egg they will also have visits from king tut , the cockatoo king tut , whose feathers are the color of peach ice cream , belongs to madeline gilbert , a librarian at the mamaroneck avenue school , a few blocks from the nursing home ms gilbert has had the twoandahalfyearold bird since he was three months old because his wings are clipped just enough to prevent him from flying away , she is able to take him with her to school as well as to sarah neuman born and raised in captivity , he has imprinted on humans and is as responsive to people as a puppy he s a very focused , very centered , very peopleoriented bird , ms gilbert said he loves to meet new people and show them his tricks he can do little threedimensional puzzles with his feet on a recent day , after visiting mrs racusin and the others in the pavilion , ms gilbert wound her way through a labyrinth of halls , with king tut balanced on her shoulder she eventually came to the room of sophie hammond , 60 , who is rendered virtually immobile by multiple sclerosis lying on her back in bed , with nothing moving but her mouth and eyes , ms hammond managed to convey her delight when king tut climbed her bed rails and perched delicately on her collarbone he can come here any time he wants to , she said in a barely audible voice bird and human looked at each other as if on cue , king tut gave her a gentle peck with his beak any time at all photos sophie hammond , left , greets king tut at sarah r neuman nursing home in mamaroneck frances racusin , above , with cockatiels madeline gilbert , below , with her pet , king tut \( photographs by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
i have been asked repeatedly in the last two months about my knees and whether the arthritis remedy i mentioned in a column on alternative medicine was actually working it is a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate , natural substances that are centrally involved in the formation of the cartilage that caps the ends of bones deterioration of this articular cartilage and resulting abnormalities in the surrounding bone cause the stiffness , pain , crackling sounds and sometimes swelling of joints that are the hallmarks of osteoarthritis , the wearandtear form of arthritis that afflicts 16 million americans the product had seemed to be so effective in countering the arthritic lameness of my 11yearold spaniel that i decided to try it myself after two months on this remedy , i am about 30 percent better i am not painfree and i still tend to get a little stiff after prolonged sitting , but i have stopped limping , i am playing tennis and ice skating with less pain and my knees have stopped swelling after strenuous activity but please understand that i am only an anecdote of one , not a study that proves anything without a careful scientific study , any personal account of benefit leaves open to question what actually caused the improvement the starting dose of three capsules a day costs about 167 since it is sold as a nutritional supplement rather than a drug , it is not covered by health insurance the usual treatments for osteoarthritis are antiinflammatory drugs , combined with musclestrengthening activities and judicious exercise this approach may relieve discomfort and slow deterioration of the joint , but it does not restore the health of damaged cartilage and can cause serious drug reactions might something work \? rebuilding damaged cartilage has long been the holy grail of orthopedics and rheumatology , and supporters of the glucosaminechondroitin combination hope it will be the first remedy to achieve this the individual ingredients have already been shown to improve arthritic symptoms in more than a dozen studies in europe , some of which were welldesigned european researchers have shown , using radioactively labeled substances , that glucosamine and chondroitin taken by mouth do indeed find their way to articular cartilage , and biopsies of some treated patients have shown structural improvements in damaged cartilage dr marc hochberg , chief of rheumatology at the university of maryland school of medicine , said that early studies of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate when taken orally for osteoarthritis appear to demonstrate that they are effective and warrant examination in a placebocontrolled , randomized trial the american college of rheumatology also noted the promise of early studies but cautioned that what looks promising at first does n't always pan out to be effective or safe the arthritis foundation also cited european reports indicating that the two nutrients are safe and may be helpful in controlling pain and improving function but added that good , controlled , longterm studies are needed to see if the products are indeed helpful and safe the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin is now being tested in welldesigned human trials by a few clinical researchers in the united states dr amal das , an orthopedic surgeon in hendersonville , nc , is assessing its effectiveness in 100 patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee for six months , the patients will receive either a dummy medication a placebo or a combination of glucosamine and chondroitin , and each will be thoroughly evaluated before and after the treatment for pain and disability dr das is financing the study but nutramax , a baltimore company that produces a product that combines relatively large doses of glucosamine and chondroitin , is donating the product the same product is also being evaluated by american military doctors in norfolk , va , for its ability to relieve arthritic back and knee pain in united states navy seals dr das , who specializes in hip and knee replacement , said he had been searching for a biological alternative to joint replacement when he stumbled upon the european data on glucosamine and chondroitin glucosamine was described as reducing the pain and disability associated with osteoarthritis and chondroitin appeared to slow progression of the disease he said he started using the treatment in patients who could not tolerate antiinflammatory drugs the compounds are not toxic and , in safety studies at cornell university s college of veterinary medicine , the combination product lacked side effects beyond occasional loose stools in dogs if the compounds are proved to be as effective as the european studies say they are , they should be used in the united states and they should replace the antiinflammatory medications , dr das said a preventive medicine specialist in arizona who is himself using this remedy and has prescribed it for about 600 patients , including his mother and grandmother , has decided not to await results of these studies and instead summarized the european findings in a book that promotes the combination as part of a ninepoint program for combating osteoarthritis the book , despite its injudicious title , the arthritis cure , by dr jason theodosakis with brenda adderly and barry fox \( st martin s press , 2295 \) , makes no wild claims needed healthy skepticism
washington , july 16 the food and drug administration today approved the first medical device intended to reduce epileptic seizures the device , the neuorcybernetic prosthesis system , made by cyberonics inc of webster , tex , was approved for use in conjunction with drugs or surgery in adults and adolescents with what are called partial onset seizures , the agency said the approval came only 19 days after an fda advisory committee recommended it the agency said it received an application on jan 27 to market the device and expedited its review because of the product s potential for reducing seizures in people who lack effective , alternative treatment the device consists of a generator implanted under the collarbone like a pacemaker and connected to the vagus nerve in the neck , where it delivers electrical signals to the brain to control seizures it includes an external programming system used by a doctor to change stimulation settings patients can turn the stimulator on and off with a magnet approximately 17 million americans have epilepsy , about 200 , 000 of whom have seizures that cannot be fully or adequately controlled with drugs or surgery , the fda said the new device will reduce the frequency of seizures in many people , said bruce burlington , director of the center for devices and radiological health at the agency in clinical trials the device was implanted in 454 patients with poorly controlled seizures at 45 medical centers in the united states , canada and europe the agency said that most of the patients , who also continued to take antiseizure medicine , showed some improvement in one study , half the patients who used the device had at least 20 percent fewer seizures per day for about a quarter of the patients , the decrease was more than 50 percent but seizures actually increased for about onefifth of the patients nine patients died during the studies , the agency said , but none of the deaths were believed to have been caused by the device patients reported several side effects , including coughing , hoarseness , voice changes and shortness of breath the agency said it had asked the company to evaluate its data to find out whether it could predict which patients were most likely to benefit from the device
paris , june 7 nobody s perfect not anymore ninthseeded iva majoli of croatia exploited a lessthanperfect performance from martina hingis something that has been a rarity in the 16yearold swiss sensation s career and had been nonexistent in 1997 to pull off a stunning 64 , 62 upset today in the final of the french open the 19yearold majoli \( pronounced mayohlee \) , the first grand slam champion from croatia and the lowestseeded woman to win a grand slam in the open era , simply pounded hingis into unconditional surrender on the center court in the process , she ended the teenager s 37match undefeated streak on the 1997 tour i was just feeling in control the whole time , said majoli , who had never reached a grand slam final before the match , i felt like this was it this could be the one meanwhile , hingis admitted that she was unable to contend with majoli s pace or depth today , a predicament that stressed her to the point where she felt her legs dissolving into cramps by the final game her collapse against the robust majoli , a challenger she had handled , 61 , 63 , indoors at the paris open earlier this year , provided the first glimpse of hingis s inability or her unwillingness , as the case seemed to be today to cope with adversity in the form of pressure , injury and fatigue i do n't know why , but something was n't going the right way i wanted it on the court , hingis said if something did n't work before , i always had another weapon to get out of the pressure , but today , i did n't have anything , and she was just better hingis implied that her left knee , the one that required arthroscopic surgery in april after she took a spill from a horse , was to blame for her lack of mobility beaten but unbowed , hingis conceded the match to majoli , but added a word of warning i won 37 matches this year and you 're the only one who beat me , she said , standing in the middle of center court with a microphone in hand and her discarded runnerup platter nearby , so watch out ! hingis claimed she was n't exactly injured , just tapped out from the rigors of rushing herself back into shape in time to try to collect her second grand slam crown of 1997 no one sees what hard work it was to get here after the surgery it s a wonder that i could compete at this tournament , said hingis , who noted again that she had set her sights on a semifinal finish here but today s stumble was all the more shocking because hingis , who had accumulated the secondbest start in the history of the wta tour , behind steffi graf s 450 sprint in 1987 , had come to seem unbeatable she was n't created by a team of ibm scientists and programmers , but hingis had certainly done to the incumbent generation of tennis champions what deep blue did to garry kasparov she had n't rendered them obsolete , but she had served notice that they either needed to improve or send up the white flag hingis has come along at an advantageous moment the three top campaigners from the generation ahead of her have taken a step backward , each for a different reason graf , haunted by injuries and family troubles , seems nearly incapacitated by insecurity monica seles has been unable to recapture the ferocity and the fitness she enjoyed before she was stabbed in the back in april 1993 and after a decade of chasing balls , arantxa sanchez vicario seems to have run out of octane this year , for the first time since 1987 , none of those former champions reached the final round that privilege went to these two teenagers , both in their first french open final , and the one who played headier tennis prevailed the surprise was , it was n't hingis i was feeling like an underdog , but that helped , said majoli , who after her semifinal victory against amanda coetzer proclaimed herself ready to win a grand slam i knew she was confident , but i knew she s not unbeatable my plan was just to attack her serve , put more pressure on her forehand , just be aggressive luckily , today everything worked when we were at the podium , martina came and told me , 'you just killed me today' in the opening set , hingis s forehand was tentative , and her serving was n't steady enough to bother majoli s rhythm on her returns though hingis battled through and saved six break points against her serve in the fifth game , she proved vulnerable again in the seventh game after thwarting majoli s eighth break chance with a welldisguised forehand winner , hingis doublefaulted into a ninth she then lost the game when majoli pounded a forehand deep into the corner for 43 poised to serve for the set at 54 , majoli began the game with an ace and claimed the set with her first set point when hingis , committing another of the uncharacteristic mistakes that marred the 79minute match , netted a backhand return though her track record indicated that hingis would react to the loss of the first set by coming on like gangbusters in the second , that did n't happen today to open the set , hingis instantly got into break trouble again and had to save three break points to escape with the game but in the fifth game , she was pushed far behind the baseline by majoli s ground strokes on break point , hingis , obviously a step slow as she tried to chase down yet another of majoli s sidelinesplitting backhands , swatted a forehand out of bounds at 3040 to trail by 32 with her strategy in shambles and her confidence shaken , hingis seized the only course of action that made sense at the time she took a strategic bathroom break when hingis returned to the court to a chorus of whistles , neither her composure nor her game seemed rejuvenated she earned more jeers , and a warning from the chair umpire , francois pareau , when she slammed her racquet onto the court in disgust after smacking a forehand into the net as majoli served at 1530 once majoli , who faced no break points , held for 42 , hingis did a fast fade , losing her serve at love then , as if unwilling to let majoli serve out the match , hingis took an injury timeout after the changeover that preceded the final game the treatment included a massage and extension exercises of her left leg , the one she had surgery on just five weeks before this grand slam started the ministrations failed to improve her mobility , and after saving one match point with a forehand return , she succumbed on the second maybe i did n't play my best tennis in this tournament , and my serve will always be a little problem , especially if i'm getting tired , hingis said in a grand slam , you just do n't feel every day in your best shape match points in the men s doubles final , the defending champions , yevgeny kafelnikov and daniel vacek , seeded fourth , defeated topseeded todd woodbridge and mark woodforde , 76 \( 1412 \) , 46 , 63 photos iva majoli , 19 , became the first grand slam champion from croatia \( reuters \) martina hingis showing her frustration \( associated press \)
five members of a hasidic community in rockland county and a man from brooklyn were indicted yesterday on charges that they systematically defrauded the federal and state governments of tens of millions of dollars in student loans , business assistance and housing subsidies in one scheme , according to federal prosecutors , a seminary in brooklyn was financed almost entirely by federal pell grants awarded to ineligible or nonexistent students the defendants also looted state student aid programs , small business administration programs and the federal section 8 housing program , prosecutors said the plans , the authorities said , were used to enrich the defendants but also to benefit the community institutions of new square , the rockland county village , along with the local yeshiva in a broad indictment unsealed in manhattan , the united states attorney s office depicted a vast scheme by which the six men and others enrolled thousands of new square and brooklyn residents in postsecondary education programs in jewish seminaries and rockland county community college to obtain money fraudulently through federal pell grants , which are awarded to needy postsecondary students the indictment said that most of the students were not eligible for the grants , did not get their degrees and , in some cases , enrolled after recruiters promised them hundreds of dollars a year prosecutors said that one brooklyn seminary program fraudulently got 103 million in pell grants on behalf of its purported students the government s investigation has been no secret in the tightly knit community of about 6 , 000 in new square , which consists almost entirely of hasidim news of the indictment drew sharp criticism there yesterday a statement by village representatives contended that the united states attorney in manhattan , mary jo white , had a vendetta against new square residents , and that federal agents had earlier scared small children there by serving subpoenas at 6 am in a manner remindful of the holocaust that many in this community endured decades ago rabbi mayer schiller , who said he was a spokesman for the residents , said he was certain that the accusations would be proven false they have imposed a reign of terror on this entire community , he said , referring to the federal prosecutors ms white responded by citing an earlier phase of the investigation when , in 1995 , a federal judge held the yeshiva of new square in contempt of court for failing to obey a grand jury subpoena for its bank records and other documents , which led to a 1 million fine paid by the yeshiva given the repeated efforts to obstruct the grand jury s investigation , she said , the response and accusations of unfair treatment are disheartening , but not surprising the indictment was vague about just how the money was put to use , and just how much ended up back in the community rabbi schiller said that new square was founded in 1957 by four holocaust survivors , including chaim berger , one of the defendants named in yesterday s indictment the indictment said mr berger had been a member of the village s board of trustees and the board of the yeshiva of new square , and was chairman of the board of the brooklyn seminary , toldos yakov yosef , where many of the new square and brooklyn students receiving pell grants were enrolled the indictment asserted that mr berger and two other administrators of the seminary , kalmen stern and david goldstein , created a false picture of the seminary s programs to qualify for federal aid the indictment said they falsified resumes , minutes of the board meetings and reviews of student progress to get federal money the seminary was financed almost exclusively by pell grants awarded to the school on behalf of its alleged students from 1987 to 1992 , the indictment said but in reality , it added , the school enrolled students who did not meet the requirements , were not seeking a degree and did not take tests or even take part in any actual program of study the indictment said that in the early 1980 s , mr berger and others helped create an independent studies program for new square students at rockland county community college from 1982 to 1988 , thousands of students were enrolled , and most got pell grants and state tuition aid the indictment said that many of these students were also not eligible for aid , and in some cases , did not even know they were enrolled some new square and brooklyn residents were enrolled in as many as five different educational institutions , and received pell grants for as many as 10 or more years , without ever receiving any degree or any certificate reflecting that they had completed a program of study , the indictment said besides mr berger and mr stern , the indictment charged three other new square residents jacob elbaum mr berger s son , benjamin , and avrum d friesel , who rabbi schiller said is the son of new square s mayor

cambridge , mass a librarian and literacy teacher who works in harlem has filed a 100 million libel suit against joe klein , aka anonymous , the author of the 1995 novel primary colors , and his publisher , random house daria carterclark claims that she is the basis for the character ms baum , a literacy teacher in harlem who has a fling with jack stanton , a clintonesque southern governor sprinting through a presidential primary ms carterclark says she has been defamed because the novel suggests , falsely , that she had sex with mr clinton as a novelist who was once sued for libel , i feel mr klein s pain but i also understand ms carterclark s pain , whether or not her lawsuit has merit we fiction writers have to be careful when we appropriate other people s lives for use in our work being sued is an emotionally nasty business and can cost more than two oceangoing yachts the collision of reality and fiction that provoked the suit against me concerned an odd surname i had given to an unsavory character in my first novel it was a name that swam up out of my unconscious it belonged to a teenager i 'd gone to dancing school with years earlier i ended up settling out of court because my lawyer informed me that juries in such cases generally back the plaintiff if names constitute a relatively easy shoal for a writer to avoid , real life events and people are somewhat trickier to navigate w somerset maugham , in his delicious novel cakes and ale , audaciously exploited two literary contemporaries , thomas hardy , who died shortly before the novel was written , and hugh walpole , an acquaintance saul bellow used the tormented poet delmore schwartz , who had been a contemporary in new york literary circles , as his model for the main character in humboldt s gift and philip roth , who seems to delight in taking great chunks of his and other people s lives and dropping them into his fiction , based his protagonist in the ghost writer on the novelist bernard malamud john updike , in one of his novels , gave an important character the same peculiar anomaly of the toes as that of his former wife i know this only from having seen her bare foot none of these models sued , partly , i suspect , because they were all inhabitants of a rarefied literary world where such invasions are more or less expected it s understood that in addition to imagination , most fiction writers have always relied on what and who they know to provide the blood and bones of their stories and novels and most of us who inhabit that world can live with it on the other hand , there is the case of the british poet stephen spender he sued david leavitt for plagiarism after mr leavitt wrote a novel , while england sleeps , that embroidered scenes from mr spender s autobiography in a way that the poet said he found pornographic mr leavitt s publishers in america and britain killed his book , although a reworked version was later published in the united states in a recent interview , mr leavitt acknowledged that he should have thought more about how his novel would upset mr spender but it was a failure , he explained , that resulted from the fact that i was so deeply into the novel as a novel that i forgot the real world joe klein cannot offer such an explanation though his novel tells a comingofage story about a young political aide , it s really little more than a satire of the 1992 presidential campaign despite bits of camouflage , it is obvious who all of the major and minor characters were modeled on the protagonist , for example , is clearly based on george stephanopoulos , even though the fictional character is black indeed , the book , with all the hoopla about its anonymous author , was marketed as disguised journalism here , ladies and gents , is the inside story of the clinton campaign , which we have clothed in the thinnest possible fictional dress primary colors , and the baum character , have the ring of authenticity because mr klein hewed so closely to real life but it is one thing to make fun of a public figure , especially in a book of political satire it is another when a private person is involved this is why i sympathize with ms carterclark s distress perhaps most literary types and politicians can handle the embarrassment of being identified with a fictional character of questionable virtue \( some may even enjoy the attention \) ordinary people like ms carterclark should n't have to fiction writers often base their characters on people they have known many of us need to do this but we also need to make sure we disguise these people for both their sake and ours drawing \( jason pickleman jnl \)
the revelation came to roderick b mitchell nine christmases ago , when his supermarket company in the bedfordstuyvesant section of brooklyn was bleeding cash and the first clue was engelbert humperdinck at a checkout counter in the company s pathmark on fulton street , in the heart of one of the city s largest black communities , were collections of humperdinck holiday tunes , displayed in a huge but untouched cassette carousel i went berserk , said mr mitchell , who had just become chairman of the thenstruggling restoration supermarket corporation , a novel joint venture between a grocery chain and a neighborhood development group i mean he s a great singer , but it s just not relevant here some things were very offcenter today , the market is tailored to the neighborhood s africanamerican and caribbean customers , the shelves stocked with west indian spices and the produce section with mango , papaya and sugar cane now , after a decade of streamlining and soulsearching , the supermarket is one of the top performers in the 144store pathmark chain , with reported 1996 sales of 305 million and record operating profits of 1 million it is the city s seventhlargest blackowned business the ultimate success of the 1977 joint venture between pathmark stores inc and the bedfordstuyvesant restoration corporation helped lay the groundwork for the supermarket industry s slow but steady return over the last decade to the innercity neighborhoods of new york and other major cities , economists and supermarket retailers say but that partnership , a national symbol of what could be done to spur economic growth in poor neighborhoods , had an impact far beyond supermarkets it was a model for nonprofit community development groups that desperately needed private capital and , as it turned out , a profitable lesson for private companies that discovered a new entree into untapped markets there is an incredible burst of movement and growth around the country and a whole new generation of people in the private sector who see how good this is for the corporations , said bennett harrison , a professor of urban political economy at the new school for social research they see that without the neighborhood groups , they 'll get blown out of the water , lose their shirt they 've read tom wolfe three times and are afraid of getting off at the wrong exit in bedfordstuyvesant , pathmark stores , a division of the supermarkets general corporation , saw there was money to be made in the inner city but it would take a different approach , and the company learned new business practices from the development group how to stock the shelves with more relevant products , how to prevent pilfering and , perhaps most important , how to promote a whiteowned corporation from woodbridge , nj , as a friend of bedfordstuyvesant the issue was how can we do this transaction without squandering our shareholders' money \? said leonard lieberman , a former chairman and chief executive of supermarkets general who headed its pathmark division when the brooklyn deal was made we needed to maximize the number of customers who saw this as their own store , not an interloper store to reduce its risk , pathmark made the community , with restoration as the proxy , the majority stakeholder in the company pathmark proposed a joint venture , giving restoration a twothirds share and pathmark a third and operating control restoration agreed restoration , which was founded in 1967 to revive the troubled central brooklyn neighborhood and was seeking to create jobs , urged the company to hire employees from the neighborhood pathmark agreed , realizing that the presence of local workers in the store would raise the stakes for the residents we figured that when a 15yearold kid went to steal a box of cookies , maybe a neighbor would say 'do n't steal that this is our store , ' mr lieberman said and the dream turned out to be accurate but it was not until 1991 that the brooklyn supermarket , which had reported heavy losses year after year , could produce a balance sheet with no red ink and for restoration , the venture was an example of how a nonprofit group learned to act like a business , like a pathmark after mr mitchell , who became president of the development group and its supermarket company in 1988 , stumbled on the engelbert humperdinck display that year , he ordered an overhaul of the inventory he sent his staff to the streets of bedfordstuyvesant to see what customers were buying at greengrocers when the development group discovered that teenagers were loitering outside the store , it created jobs for them , as part of a pathmark courtesy crew to assist customers restoration also computerized the pricing system and preached efficiency to store managers we began to manage the things we owned as if we owned them , said mr mitchell , who is 41 and lives in harlem before , i think we were looking at it from a standpoint of this being , how shall i phrase it , more of a social services institution
when custer was fighting the cheyenne , the arapaho and the kiowa in the 1860 s and 1870 s , cigarstore indians were helping to sell tobacco all over america they stood on the sidewalk in front of tobacco stores , almost lifesize and brightly painted , beloved figures of glamour and exotic allure , signalling the wares for sale within the artifacts business , although often beautiful and fascinating , has always had a specialized relationship to reality , as may be seen in the image business shop and cigar store figures in america , an exhibition of cigarstore indians , along with cigarstore turks , scots , sailors and dozens of other wooden shop figures , at the museum of american folk art in manhattan from nov 8 through jan 11 the cigarstore indian has no more to do with any real native americans than joe camel has to do with useful beasts of the desert male or female , cigarstore indians wear feather headdresses like some plains indian chiefs , yet their link with tobacco often they hold or rest their feet on rolled tobacco leaves or cigars or they smoke clay pipes associates them with the native virginians who introduced english colonists in the early 17th century to what was called the indian weed the word indian itself , as every american schoolchild knows , results from error in 1492 , anywhere east of the indus river was considered the indies and the people who lived there indians columbus , in the caribbean islands , thought he was in asia it took quite a while for the european explorers to realize where they had got to , and even after they did the name indian continued to be used for all the native peoples of the new world , from the incas and aztecs to the sioux and mashantucket pequots five hundred years later we are just beginning to rectify columbus s mistake it s the essence of stereotype to ignore differences , to amalgamate and homogenize , creating uniformity where none exists there were more than 2 , 000 cultures in the americas when the spanish arrived , all with different values , customs , beliefs and languages within a tribe there could be more individuation than might exist among wasp members of a given country club but the cigarstore indian was everywhere similar , of no tribe and no place , wearing splendid jewelry , tunic , feathers , sometimes fringed leggings , the noble savage of early19thcentury romantic imagining and an object lesson in the relationship between popular art and stereotype cigarstore indians were made out of sections of ships' masts by shipcarvers , the same men who carved the figureheads and other ornaments of the american fleet in its golden age a master carver roughed out a sketch on a log , chopping the outlines another man finished the body , leaving the face for the master to get back to an apprentice sanded , and someone else painted manufactured in port cities along the eastern seaboard , wooden shop figures were sent to cities and towns all over america , where , in their heyday , the second part of the 19th century , they were as omnipresent as neon signs are now by 1890 , their novelty was gone , and they were replaced by other modes of advertising , among them posters and chromolithographs when i try to think of a contemporary equivalent for these large , sculptural fantasy figures and the appeal they must have had , i think of the manytimeslargerthanlifesize inflated balloon figures of spiderman and snoopy and betty boop and barney in the macy s thanksgiving day parade i also think of the excitement , at disney world , of getting to shake hands with beauty or the beast what s appealing is the palpability of the fantasy world , its willingness to enter physically our daily life cigarstore indians stood right next to you on the sidewalk you could look at them eyeball to eyeball people posed for photographs beside them , as we do now next to cardboard figures of the president they draped an arm around the indian s neck and perhaps felt connected to a bigger and more glamorous world indian shop figures were the most popular , but there were others scotsmen and turks also hawked tobacco products , turks because of their traditional association with cigarettes , scots because of an association with snuff \( you knew the turk by his turban and loose pants , the scot by his plaid kilt \) sailors , in the popular imagination , were smokers and were also used to advertise tobacco celebrities of every kind politicians , fictional characters and national heroes were reproduced the lady of fashion , the race track tout , the baseball player \( batter or pitcher \) were other popular types , examples of which will be on view in the show at the museum of american folk art popular art , with its quick effects , often depends on stereotype it ca n't take the time to make distinctions or to plumb the diversity of human nature within categories the rule for stereotype is one category , one character what it allows \( besides facility \) is variety it generates a gallery of types like dickens s mostly onedimensional characters , stereotypes are not deep but they are many put a few of them together and you begin to have a psychologically complex portrait of one individual but to look to them for complexity is beside the point this is the art of the one note , offering vividness , not subtlety and nuance , breadth rather than depth

philadelphia , june 3 when the national hockey league season began , the detroit red wings were trying to trade away paul coffey and trying to trade for brendan shanahan they accomplished both in a multiplayer deal with the hartford whalers , who later sent the unhappy coffey to the philadelphia flyers in another transaction arranged to please him all these moves came full circle tonight when the red wings beat the flyers , 42 , to take a twogamestonone lead in the fourofseven stanley cup finals shanahan scored twice among his five shots on goal , providing the first and last goals of the game , and he almost scored on two other shots that hit the goal posts and coffey \? he was on the ice for three detroit goals at even strength and he was in the penalty box for the other one at the end of the game , coffey stood at the end of the flyers bench , doubled over as if in pain or anguish an hour after the game , he was still in the private area of the flyers locker room , unavailable for comment his coach criticized coffey s play but said healthwise , he is fine but a flyers spokesman said coffey took a shoulder to the jaw late in the game and would not be available to discuss his play he s a little woozy , the spokesman said he s not going to come out and talk shanahan was available , and discussed the pressure of coming to detroit as the player who some said was the necessary ingredient for a talented team that lacked a dimension of toughness and scoring touch on the front lines he is the key addition , some said , as the wings try to win the cup for the first time since 1955 , the longest drought in the nhl during the regular season , shanahan scored 47 goals , the most on the team in the playoffs , he is tied for the team lead with eight pressure is better than not facing any pressure , shanahan said if you have the mentality and are the kind of person that wants to be a professional athlete , you enjoy pressure it is horrible to be sitting down and not involved aside from coffey and shanahan , the other subplot of this game and this series is the philadelpia goaltending garth snow , replacing ron hextall , fell victim to the same thing that got hextall benched after game 1 last saturday like hextall , snow gave up a goal on a long slap shot at a critical time tonight , it was a goal by kirk maltby , which broke a 22 tie at 2 minutes 39 seconds of the second period it ruined the momentum and spirit of the flyers , who had rallied from a 20 deficit to tie the score on two powerplay goals deflections by rod brind'amour late in the first we have to have a higher responsibility to ourselves as a team and to our fans , that we play better , and that starts with goaltending , murray said referring to both defensive breakdowns and to poor play in the net , murray added , those kinds of plays , and not getting the big stops , are your worst nightmare when you get to the finals when asked whether hextall or snow would play in game 3 , when the series shifts to detroit on thursday night , murray replied , well , i am not going to give that answer right now because i honestly do n't know myself tonight s result marked the first time in this tournament that philadelphia had lost two consecutive games and when the flyers go to detroit they will be playing not only against the red wings but also against history since the fourofsevengame format was introduced in the championship round in 1939 , only three teams have won the first two games of the finals and failed to win the cup one of them was the 1966 red wings , who won the first two games in montreal but lost the next four the last time it happened was in 1971 , also a montreal victory , this time over chicago the first team to win the first two games and lose the series was also detroit , in 1942 , against toronto shanahan s first goal , at 1 37 of the first period , came on a long slap shot after a rush that followed a philadelphia turnover the second , at 9 56 of the third period , came on a wrist shot during a twoonone rush with martin lapointe after sergei fedorov s long pass sprang them clear out of the detroit zone coffey was among those defending on the play scotty bowman , the detroit coach , had been harshly critical of coffey after the trade , saying that the veteran of championship teams in pittsburgh and edmonton lacked necessary skills as a defender or a point man on the power play bowman came close to apologizing for those remarks tonight , saying , paul is a hall of fame player of shanahan , bowman said the wings aggressively sought a trade for him after their captain , steve yzerman , returned from the world cup tournament after playing with shanahan for team canada he told us that this guy is the total package off the ice , on the ice , everywhere you want , bowman said tonight , i mean , he took the body , he played defensively in the third period when we asked him to he has had a lot of pressure on him yzerman scored the other detroit goal , the one that put the wings up by 20 at 9 22 of the first period the flyers , bigger and strong than the wings , played well for long stretches , winning faceoffs and keeping the puck in detroit s end of the ice eric lindros , their big , young , strong captain , expressed confidence for the rest of the series we expect to do good things in detroit , lindros said the pressure is on them with a 20 lead photos brendan shanahan celebrating after his second goal , a wrist shot that got by flyers goalie garth snow the goal gave the red wings a 42 lead in the third period \( reuters

loveland , colo , june 14 a struggle went on inside the jury room , in the hours and days leading up to timothy j mcveigh s conviction and death sentence , but the conflict was not one among the jurors themselves instead , it was a battle between the raw emotion they felt at the testimony about the carnage caused by the april 19 , 1995 , bombing in oklahoma city , which spilled over into frequent tears for some , and the stern judicial injunctions to keep sentiment and reasoning strictly separate this common internal conflict bound them together , several jurors suggested in interviews today , as did a shared bafflement at the mystery of mr mcveigh and his murderous act the result , the jurors suggested , was an unusual degree of closeness throughout the deliberations , and a final decision that was wrenching but hardly contentious from the start , they said , there was little dissension on the central questions of guilt and punishment we were a very closeknit group , said vera chubb , 65 , sitting in her living room in this pleasant lakefront city 50 miles north of denver from day 1 , our personalities were very close we meshed well together if we had questions , we could always sit down and talk it out in a last show of unity , 11 of the 12 jurors gathered this afternoon for a relaxed , cheerful news conference at a downtown denver hotel the foreman , james osgood , an engineer , made a point of thanking his colleagues for working together as such a cohesive team i think it embodied the true spirit of teamwork he spoke of the careful sifting and weighing that had taken place in the jury room when he said , i was compelled by the absolute plethora of evidence , none of his fellow jurors disagreed another juror , fred clarke , 42 , a computer programmer and retired air force veteran , said , it was not tense by any stretch of the imagination a third juror , tonya stedman , 24 , a waitress , connected tension inside the room to the testimony s emotional freight , but agreed on the essential unity of the jurors so tension , yes , emotion , yes , but i think we were very unified in the sense that we worked well together and we appreciated everyone s opinion , and we agreed to disagree at times , ms stedman said in an interview outside her denver home there were plenty of surface differences among the jurors one was a deadhead , an ardent fan of the grateful dead others were straightarrow military veterans or offspring of veterans , and one professed himself an enthusiast of rush limbaugh , the conservative radio show host but even before the five women and seven men began their deliberations , a number of elements appeared to bind them together most seemed to pay close attention throughout the weeks of testimony all developed great respect for judge richard p matsch , as was evident at this afternoon s press conference it was evident from day 1 he was in control , mr osgood said all expressed varying degrees of willingness to impose the death penalty most expressed a lack of interest in , or disdain for , the news media these ties served well once deliberations began the jurors shared a common sense that a terrible mystery lay at the heart of the case , even as they methodically reviewed , day by day , year by year , the events of the young man s life we all sat there and tried to figure out why a young man would do this , mrs chubb said , shaking her head slowly i 'd like to know what really got him started this way it s just a mystery a lot of us said , we just do n't understand , she added he planned this for almost two years he could have stopped at any time along the way the mystery was compounded by mr mcveigh s stony demeanor in court this upset a number of jurors i was very bothered that he showed no emotion , said john candelaria , a landscaper , at the afternoon press conference the horror at the crime that had been so intricately laid out for them mingled with the knowledge of the wrenching decision they would have to make at the end for the jurors , the deliberations were heavy with emotion we 're talking of convicting a man of guilt for a huge crime , no 1 , ms stedman said no 2 , proceeding to make a determination on whether he should live or die i mean , emotional is an understatement at times , mrs chubb said , the effect of the day s testimony was overwhelming some days , you would come home and think , i'm all right , then for some strange reason , tears would come to your eyes mr clarke , for one , was conscious of the need to keep feeling and analysis apart i might have shed a tear or two during the victims' testimony , but nothing i needed a tissue for , he said my job was just to sit there and listen , not to get emotional , but to listen and assimilate the information i equate it to putting together a puzzle when the time came for the final decision about mr mcveigh s fate , the jurors became especially methodical , mrs chubb said we said , this is a young man s life , she said we have got to give it every thought , every prayer everything we could think of , we went over you know what a terrible thing he did but when you have never had to do it , she said , referring to imposing the death sentence , it weighs a little heavy finally , after lunch on friday , the decision was made , and the final vote taken the room was quiet , mrs chubb said , very quiet the jurors sat in silence for a moment but they had made each other a promise , she said we all said , when they ask you , you will look him straight in the eye and say , 'death' photo jurors in the oklahoma city bombing trial became especially close martha hite , who was one of the 12 panelists , spoke to reporters on friday after the jury recommended death for

st petersburg , fla , march 20 tim raines has heard the whispers that darryl strawberry will be the left fielder , whispers that have escalated to screams but a disappointed raines said he had sensed it before anyone else because he could see the writing on joe torre s potential lineup card competition \? what competition \? raines does not think he was given a legitimate chance to win the job because strawberry s power and personality are too tempting to the manager so the awkward decisions about third base and left field that torre has dreaded are creating some tension even before he has officially informed the players who will be affected by the moves i think this decision was in the works before the spring , raines said you do n't bring darryl strawberry in during the middle of the season if you do n't think he fits then you bring him back the next year maybe i was a safety valve or something , someone for them to fall back on i'm not real sure usually , they said darryl looks pretty good and i think that s the way they were thinking speaking slowly and almost inaudibly before the st louis cardinals routed the yankees , 83 , today , raines discussed being the left fielder who could be left out while strawberry has had a fabulous spring with three homers , 13 runs batted in and a 317 average and is the defensive choice of two suspect outfielders , raines has been impressive with a 405 average and 10 runs scored but raines , who stole 10 bases while he was limited to 59 games with a strained right hamstring last season , has only swiped one in 12 games this spring and has not flaunted this advantage over strawberry when asked if he deserved to start , raines said that s not for me to answer if i was selfish , i would say , 'yes i deserve to play' i'm not that i do n't feel like i'm a selfish guy i 'll just do what i have to do what does raines do now \? even torre , who has still not told strawberry he is the left fielder or wade boggs that he is the third baseman over charlie hayes , knows the situation could be delicate for raines , a 37yearold player in the final year of a contract that pays him 14 million i think it s more important to keep him sharp than keep him happy , torre said i never want a player to be happy sitting on the bench the only thing i ask my ballplayers is to understand torre understands that a healthy strawberry could be a lethal weapon strawberry has predicted he can surpass his career highs of 39 homers and 108 rbi if he plays in 150 games , and torre did not flinch when he heard this lofty prediction from a player who has averaged 56 homers and 206 rbi in the last five seasons i do n't think that s wishful thinking , torre said look at how many people hit 30 homers last year the way people are hitting 30 is the way it used to be to hit 20 thirty , i think is realistic with strawberry , the only reason he 'd only hit 30 is the number of games played as torre spoke about how strawberry scares pitchers and how his hands are alive and how the switchhitter mark whiten must fit into the outfield mix , it sounded like raines should be worried i do n't know if i 'll be here all year , said raines , a 295 career hitter who is new york s best leadoff man actually , i really do n't know where i fit in raines said he will not ask for a trade because he wants to be a yankee there is the possibility an injury will create more playing time for raines i think darryl has been the fan favorite , maybe the media favorite , raines said he s a new york player people know him more than they know me last year , i did n't play that much they realize his potential as a power hitter all i could have done is have a good spring after that , i do n't make the decision inside pitch dwight gooden knew it was coming his glistening spring was interrupted thursday as he was pummeled for five earned runs and 10 hits in six innings in a setback to the cardinals gooden said he was totally out of sync and could not locate his pitches during the 80pitch fiasco it might have something to do with the fact that gooden only slept 45 minutes the night before because he was hooked up to a monitor for 24 hours to test for slightly high blood pressure i do n't assume that it s a big deal , joe torre said if it was a big deal , i would have been talked to gooden seemed more worried about increasing the starters' overall earned run average from 182 to 220 that s the thing that s disappointing , to be the first to take a beating , gooden said pitchers willie banks , jim mecir , carlos reyes and marcus moore were reassigned to the minor league camp and will likely start the season at class aaa rings for replacements george steinbrenner has decided to give 25 , 000 and world series rings to three strike replacement players who were denied championship shares last year after a heated vote by the yankees players infielder matt howard and relievers dale polley and dave pavlas will be rewarded they helped us win some games , joe torre said i think it s a nice gesture when i first found out they did n't get shares , i was disturbed but they knew going in there was a possibility something like this could happen none of the players , who would have received more than 25 , 000 if shares were based only on service time , are likely to make the 25man roster
franklin lakes , nj , feb 19 the disclosure of a childhood heart murmur by khalid reeves to doctors in dallas today delayed the completion of the nineplayer deal between the nets and the mavericks instead of having the deal done tonight , the mavericks requested an extension until noon thursday to have a morning stress test done on reeves according to mavericks officials , there was nothing in reeves s medical history to indicate a heart murmur when he was getting his physical , it came up that he had a childhood heart murmur , said kevin sullivan , the mavericks' vice president of communications it was n't revealed in his exam if it was a serious thing , it could kill the deal but those close to the situation say there is only mild concern that an ailment will be discovered that would nullify the trade it is not unheard of for a failed physical to void a deal on feb 4 , 1994 , robert horry and matt bullard were traded from houston to detroit for sean elliott , who failed his physical three days later but the more likely scenario would be similar to the trade that sent reeves to new jersey from charlotte a year ago new jersey delayed that deal when it asked for additional tests on reeves s ankle before the trade went through but a delay is a delay and it put off any deal the nets make tonight to seal a trade of jim jackson he is not officially theirs to trade , which also holds true for sam cassell , george mccloud , eric montross and chris gatling the nets have taken more than a dozen calls from teams interested in jackson , and they have also had talks with the los angeles lakers about mccloud in a deal that would bring corie blount and sean rooks to the nets the nets may be looking for a small forward such as clarence weatherspoon of the philadelphia 76ers he is on the trading block , as is dennis scott of the orlando magic but the nets would also like a deal that involved a high draft pick one such offer is on the table the cleveland cavaliers would give the nets bobby phills plus a firstround draft pick which could be the pick the cavaliers have from phoenix it might take a more enticing deal to pry jackson from the nets of the offers the nets had this afternoon , coach john calipari said none moved him to want to pull the trigger while all potential nets trades were put on hold pending the outcome of reeves s stress test , so too was the first practice the team intended to have tonight a long white van pulled up next to the ramapo high school gym tonight , stuffed with five new nets who appeared sullen as they filed out in hooded sweatsuits they were on their way to what was supposed to be their first official practice but 20 minutes before it began as cassell was going oneonone in the far corner with jackson everyone was pulled off the court we met and walked through stuff and let the new guys watch , said calipari , who had tape put over the gym window to discourage onlookers this is crazy i know coach pat riley is crazy because he does n't know what we 're going to do neither do the nets there was still confusion two days after the trade that sent shawn bradley , ed o'bannon , robert pack and reeves to dallas several former mavericks were known to be upset that they were not traded to a contender jackson still does n't know if he will be traded again and he does n't understand why he was sent to a team that already was loaded with guards but jackson was sure in his opinion of general manager don nelson , who labeled the players he traded as malcontents i was surprised because don never had the opportunity to sit down and talk with me , said jackson , who many believe was at the heart of the personality conflicts at dallas he did n't come to a practice he was n't in our locker room the only time i saw him was at a game for him to say the things he said without sitting down and talking to us was surprising to me our communication with don nelson has been limited just the potential of conflict with new egos and new desires for playing times has been enough to make some nets wonder about the wisdom of the trade there is concern over what the chemistry will be like with potentially five new players i tell you what , it s going to be interesting , said jayson williams a lot of these guys have a whole lot of different personalities you got kendall gill here who likes to get his certain amount of shots and now you got jimmy jackson , who i'm sure does n't want to share too much time with kerry kittles but this is why we pay john calipari 200 million he can work out the chemistry that s what coaching is in the nba it s not about x s and o s all these guys know how to play we all run the same plays , and all do the same things a coach , all he does is work on chemistry and motivation calipari may be working on a few more trades , too but nothing can transpire until reeves passes his stress test calipari did not seem concerned about the delay , saying , it s just a snag rebounds chris gatling seemed to be the only newcomer with a hint of a smile on his face he is from elizabeth , nj i just hope they have a white headband here , said gatling , who is never without one on the court photo new nets , from left , eric montross , chris gatling and jim jackson , joking with xavier mcdaniel last night \( steve berman for the new york times \) \( pg b15

oh , what a good seat you have ! crowed the ebullient usher on the rightcenter aisle at the winter garden theater , as she led me to row k you 're going to love this ! this was unnerving i have never had a particularly bad experience with an usher , but i 'd never before had one congratulate me on my seat location was i wrong to suspect that she thought this might be my first broadway show \? judging from the evidence all around me the babel of languages , the cameras in the laps , the large number of 4yearolds with whiskers painted on their faces the percentages were with her this was not exactly what the broadway cognoscenti would have called a firstnight crowd this was not even a 1 , 000thnight crowd this was an ever rarer assembly a 5 , 968thnight crowd the show the crowd had come to , of course , was cats , a musical that made its broadway debut nearly 15 years ago , which means it has run longer than most real cats \( this summer , it will surpass a chorus line as the longestrunning show in broadway history \) i had n't seen it since it was the new kitten in town , when breathless articles were still being written about the brilliance of musicalizing t s eliot s poetry , before the show was transformed from ether into granite as rock solid and indestructible as any other tourist monument my assignment was to take another look at this theatrical perennial , as well as at two of the other legendary megamusicals , the phantom of the opera and miss saigon , that have taken up semipermanent residence on broadway and answer the musical question how are they doing \? a reexamination had relevance beyond the ritual of a routine checkup in fact , it was one of the titans of the megamusical , the producer cameron mackintosh , who inspired it in october , mr mackintosh and john laird , producer and director of les miserables , had announced one of the biggest bloodbaths in broadway history they were so displeased with the decline in quality of the nineyearold broadway production of les miz that they were replacing many of the cast members and starting fresh with a new company on march 12 a visit to les miz in late october confirmed the musical s sorry state at 3 hours and 10 endless minutes of mostly lackluster performances , it had been nothing less than a dispiriting chore of a production so , i approached my surreptitious returns to the other three longestrunning shows on broadway via tickets purchased mostly on the days i saw them with a sense of foreboding would the experience amount to eight hours of tedious rehash , of feeling like a stranger in a strange land of theater for audiences with diminished expectations \? would it be murder to try to appreciate the work of the replacements for the replacements for the replacements of the original christine daae , the engineer and gus , the theater cat \? well , for the most part , no whether someone has been cracking the whip , or the shows are simply more attentively cast , cats , phantom and miss saigon are all in sharper condition than les miz there are several outstanding performances in the three shows , and one , by luoyong wang , the reigning engineer of miss saigon \( the part originated by jonathan pryce \) , is better than that his portrayal is nothing less than a dazzling reinterpretation that raises the level of the entire show and yet , appreciating is not the same as enjoying cats is still stuck being cats its dorian graylike youthful vigor has long since faded , and the show has a slightly haggard look and despite its snappy , almost military precision , the phantom of the opera is still saddled with one of andrew lloyd webber s least satisfying scores , which endlessly repeats a few syrupy melodies so here , in descending order of quality , is one reviewer s status report 'miss saigon' at miss saigon , which has played at the broadway theater since 1991 , i sat next to a middleaged businessman from minneapolis he said he was a vietnam veteran who had spent the 1968 tet offensive at the ton son nhut air base outside saigon , and he was clearly moved when the lights came up at intermission it all seems pretty real to me , he said it never had to me in my three previous viewings , the messageladen contrivances of miss saigon were distracting but in some ways , age has both mellowed and invigorated the show , with music by claudemichel schonberg and lyrics by alain boublil and richard maltby jr as the real events it depicts fade ever more deeply into the past , the fictional story of kim , a vietnamese woman who loves and loses a gi during the fall of saigon , has become less burdened by the show s reductive politics it s now a more moving experience , with a vibrant , scrappy cast that in many major roles is as good as the original it came as a surprise , especially since miss saigon is considered by many on broadway to be on the shakiest ground of all the longrunning hits \( among the four longest runners , it filled the smallest percentage of seats during the busy postchristmas week , according to the figures in variety \)
washington , july 15 john huang , the offstage protagonist of the senate hearings on campaign finance practices , was depicted today as the highly paid agent of an international conglomerate that has close ties to the chinese government and a record of generous contributions to the democratic party during the time mr huang worked at the commerce department and the democratic national committee , the senators were told , he retained his ties to his former employer , the lippo group , an international financial holding company based in indonesia on its fourth day of hearings , the senate government and oversight committee produced what appeared to be its first direct evidence of a foreign political contribution a memo in which mr huang asked the indonesian conglomerate that he worked for in 1992 to please kindly wire money to cover several expenses , including a 50 , 000 donation to the democratic party mr huang ultimately raised 16 million in donations for the 1996 campaign that later had to be returned because it came from suspect sources lippo , according to a witness , thomas r hampson , who specializes in international business operations , has evolved in the last few years from being a familyowned enterprise to what he said was essentially a joint venture with the chinese government mr hampson was hired by the committee to provide information on the lippo group he was one of three witnesses who appeared before the committee today to testify about lippo the significance , said senator fred thompson , the tennessee republican who is the chairman of the committee , is that apparently both mr huang and lippo were perfectly willing and adept at putting illegal money into the united states on the question of chinese involvement in american political affairs , two democratic senators , john glenn of ohio and joseph i lieberman of connecticut , said today that material they had seen in a federal bureau of investigation briefing on monday left little doubt that the chinese had a plan to influence congressional elections but they added that they saw no indication that the plan had been put into effect or that it had involved the presidential race the significance of the evidence being heard by the committee has been hotly debated ever since mr thompson opened the hearings last week by saying that the chinese had plotted to give money to influence last year s elections , including the presidential campaign democrats have said mr thompson vastly overstated the case the evidence presented at today s session included these points after president clinton took office and while mr huang was still at lippo , he visited the white house 52 times during the period he was working in the commerce department , mr huang made hundreds of calls to various lippo entities in april 1996 , when he was on the democratic payroll , mr huang was registered at a world bank seminar as a representative of lippo while none of these pieces of evidence are by themselves eyepopping , the republicans who are conducting the investigation see them as building blocks in the case they are trying to make that the chinese government tried to influence the 1996 election campaign in the united states by funneling money to democrats and that mr huang was instrumental in this enterprise mr huang has asserted his fifth amendment right against forced selfincrimination and has refused to appear before the committee members of the riady family , the principal owners of lippo and longtime patrons of mr clinton , and many other people who worked with mr huang at lippo are in indonesia and have refused to cooperate with congressional investigators to tie the lippo enterprises to china , the committee heard testimony from mr hampson , president of search international , which conducts research into the operations of international businesses mr hampson said that in the last few years the lippo group had shifted its strategic center from indonesia to china , and that much of the conglomerate s business now involved joint ventures with china resources , a company wholly owned by the chinese government china resources also has a more geopolitical purpose , he said it is well established in the public record that the government of the people s republic of china uses china resources as an agent of espionage economic , military and political the company , mr hampson continued , is kind of like a smiling tiger it might look friendly , but it s very dangerous under questioning from democrats , however , he conceded that he did not know whether chinese money was part of lippo s enterprises in the united states or whether china resources had any activities in this country documents the committee released showed that mr huang was handsomely paid by lippo , with a salary of about 90 , 000 a year and annual bonuses of about 230 , 000 when he left lippo in 1994 to join the clinton administration , he was given severance pay of more than 450 , 000 , a figure that included the book value of the company car he was allowed to keep , a 1988 mercedes benz
butte , mont , aug 29 there is no doubt that what has happened over the last 120 years in this halfdead hill town just downslope from the continental divide has ranked among the more freakish , tragic and raucous episodes in american history martial law was declared about a dozen times , with troops firing on striking miners a labor leader was dragged from his home and lynched from a railroad trestle fire choked off a mine shaft in 1917 , and 168 people suffocated nearly a halfmile underground that s just the labor history in its industrial history , butte was known as the richest hill on earth , the place that gave turnofthecentury america most of its copper at a time when that was the crucial ingredient for a country newly linked by telephones and illuminated by electric light finally , there is the account of what happened when the bill for it all came due in 1985 , the federal government declared butte and the surrounding region to be the biggest superfund cleanup site in the country , nearly an entire county full of poisons and heavy metal , and still intertwined with living , breathing neighborhoods now butte is asking the official caretakers of the united states' natural and historical treasures to take up the question of whether this city and all its mine waste , slag heaps , victorian homes , shuttered brothels , slumping hotels , skeletal mine shafts and related detritus should become one big national historic park already , the national park service recognizes places like lowell and new bedford in massachusetts as singular places worthy of the park service family textile mills are the draw in lowell new bedford was once the center of the whaling world but butte wants the concept of national historic park to encompass something altogether new typically , once a site is given an imprint from the park service , it receives a visitors center and federal dollars and will usually be promoted as one of the nation s premier attractions one of butte s main distinctions perhaps its central attraction , town leaders argue is that it is one of the world s most visibly polluted and battered places midway between yellowstone national and glacier national park would be a place to come see one of the worst industrial crimes against nature and a oncerich town struggling to live in its midst once you 've done yellowstone , then you come here to butte to see how a pittsburgh was just dropped in the middle of the rocky mountains , said jack lynch , the chief executive of the combined government of the city of butte and silver bow county the mountains are scarred and tiered , still poked full of holes the water that forms the headwaters of clark fork are laced with arsenic , manganese , lead , copper and zinc three generations of soot remain on the side of stilloccupied workers' cottages at the center of butte is the berkeley pit , a grand canyon of openpit mining the pit is an 874foot deep chasm filled with 26 billion gallons of contaminated water , an amount that grows by 3 million gallons a day as ground water moves into the old open mine and becomes part of the toxic stew two years ago , more than 300 snow geese had the misfortune of landing in the pit , mistaking its water for a normal lake at night the acid corroded the birds' stomachs and killed them but butte is as tough a town as the west has ever produced , and none of these seeming handicaps has deterred the people who live here from trying to show off this peculiar american hybrid they propose covering as much of the waste and mine tailings as possible until they are no longer an immediate threat to health or the environment then incorporating the rest of the waste into the grand historic park there is plenty of instate opposition to the plan by people who say the park plan may let the polluters off the hook mr lynch said the park would have many attractions many of its ornate , customdesigned buildings and homes , now largely abandoned , have been protected since 1962 , when butte was designated a national historic landmark we have the pit , mr lynch said we have architecture we have the only dead aquifer in the united states , i believe we went from the wrecking ball to the mothball because we realize all of this has value more than three decades later , after the major mines closed , butte picked up the superfund designation from the environmental protection agency that meant waste sites had to be cleaned until they were close to the shape they were in before mining nearly destroyed the environment the initial work on the cleanup has not satisfied mr lynch , who called it too sterile they put lime in it , put a ton of topsoil atop it , seeded it with grass and then fenced it off , he said the park service may be leery of adding a place once described as a living ghost town to its roster of 365 sites butte lost more than 50 , 000 residents in the last 50 years its population is now 36 , 000 asked to comment on butte s status , park officials in washington would say only that they were considering the application , filed several years ago
hong kong , june 24 just like its older cousin in new york , the hong kong stock market is benefiting from a robust economy and stable interest rates , and last week it hit highs and saw record volume the difference is that hong kong is about to be absorbed by communist china with just days to go before hong kong is handed from britain to china on july 1 , the market here is confounding even optimistic forecasters , virtually none of whom foresaw this bullish sentiment on the eve of such a precarious historical moment not long ago , hong kong s stock market and property markets were expected to be suffering badly in 1997 , on the assumption that mainland chinese rule would devastate economic and political life here instead , both markets are near their highs optimism about china s surging economy and growing openness have been the moving force in the last 12 months , while asia as a whole has been a tepid region for investors , hong kong s benchmark hang seng index has climbed more than 30 percent , bursting through the previously unreached barrier of 15 , 000 last friday it has not been an uninterrupted ascent , of course , with gains punctuated by periods of volatility and price weakness the hong kong market in recent years has been trading at a discount because of the coming change , said christopher wood , asian and emerging markets strategist at peregrine , a hong kongbased investment bank what s been happening this year is that the discount has narrowed as people become more confident that the handover will go smoothly one factor , other analysts said , is a widespread expectation that chinese authorities will take steps to insure that hong kong s market remains buoyant during and after the handover , part of an effort to show the world how confident hong kong is about its future everyone figures , 'china will make sure the market stays high , so i may as well get in beforehand , ' said a senior executive at merrill lynch in hong kong but no one expected it to get this high in fact , the market got even hotter than beijing wanted , partly because of a rush to sell new offerings of shares by companies with mainland interests , locally known as red chips , which have climbed even faster than the rest of the market this year last friday , partly to cool the feverish interest in these mainland companies , beijing announced new measures that make it harder for red chips to win approval to raise money in hong kong until now , red chip companies have enjoyed significantly less regulation than chinese companies listed on the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges the new measures came as a surprise no one expected beijing to introduce new marketcooling regulations so close to the handover yet china s regulators seemed concerned by the nearfrenzy of buying in hong kong stocks and apparently calculated that their new rules would rein in some exuberance without causing too sharp a drop as it turned out , the market indeed fell somewhat in monday s and today s sessions the hang seng index closed today at 14 , 89096 , down 13027 even as it cools slightly , the general exuberance in hong kong s market still seems dangerously high , some economists say , if not quite irrational overexcitement can lead to underexcitement , said miron mushkat , chief economist at lehman brothers in hong kong if everything collapses six months later , these gains will be viewed as having been an artificial bubble that will be very disappointing even so , mr mushkat said he saw positive signs that the market would remain strong for the rest of the year , a sentiment that is widely echoed by other economists and analysts and brokers hong kong s longterm future seems harder to predict envisioning possible outcomes has almost become a parlor game in the city s financial community , and everyone seems to have an opinion gary coull , chief executive of credit lyonnais securities asia , predicted that hong kong would grow steadily as a financial center in the coming decades , even if it tended to act more as a place for chinese companies to raise capital than as an international center the hong kong financial community will easily grow to supplant other centers in asia , mr coull said the idea of hong kong as an international financial center might suffer , but its role for china will more than compensate with 350 , 000 enterprises in china that need money , mr coull predicted , 300 or so will probably attempt public offerings each year for the next 20 years , and many of those will undoubtedly be in hong kong in contrast , an economist , marc faber , foresees the demise of hong kong s singular position over the next decade , primarily because with high real estate and other prices , it could lose its competitive edge it was the only bridge to china for a long time , mr faber said but you can have lots of bridges to china now , so you ca n't keep charging a high toll known in hong kong for his contrarian gloominess , which has earned him the name dr doom , mr faber predicted that within 10 years , hong kong would simply be one of 20 large cities in southern china , with few of its privileges left then again , a decade ago , when the transition to chinese rule was only in the distant future , that is what many people expected hong kong to be by now since then , moves like the appointment of a shipping magnate , tung cheehwa , as the future leader of hong kong , have reassured some investors if you 'd said 10 years ago that the stock and property markets would be at an alltime high , mr wood of peregrine said , that senior members of the civil service would all be staying on , that a businessman like c h tung would be chief executive , well , no one would have believed you graph red chips' rise while many predicted tradegy for hong kong s stock market under chinese rule , investors have turned bullish recently particularly for shares of companies

ridgefield officials , faced with the loss of one of the last remaining family farms in town , last year bought the development rights to the 101acre property on lounsbury road for 21 million by a vote of 1 , 800 to 1 , 300 , townspeople decided to keep the fruit trees and vegetable fields from being turned into building lots and because the town did not purchase the property outright , the brewster family or other families can continue to farm it and the town will not have to maintain the livestock barns and stone walls we did n't really want to get involved in owning the property , said bernard p dzielinski , chairman of the board of finance in ridgefield but we have appraisals that put the commercial value of the property at 32 million , so we got it for about twothirds of market value i guess people decided it was a good investment it s a good way to augment what the state of connecticut has been doing , he said but you have to have a fairly unique situation the owner has to be willing to take part in the transaction , or it is n't going to work this ca n't be done by someone who wants to get the maximum profit out of a property north branford has taken the process even further it set up a special account this fiscal year , with an initial appropriation of 125 , 000 , to acquire open space or farms there was a recognition by the town that farmland is starting to disappear in town , acre by acre , inch by inch , said frank b connolly , north branford s town manager the town has also established a rural preservation committee , with members from the planning and zoning commission , town council and farming community north branford is going through a transition , the change from a rural to a suburban community , mr connolly said there s an ongoing sewer construction program we 've had to get into , there s a lot of subdivision activity going on , and there s a lot of other things happening this was a general recognition that we had to do something in response , or we would wake up some day and say , 'where did all the farmland go \? ' joseph j dippel , director of the farmland preservation program for the state department of agriculture , said more towns across the state are considering how to retain their rural roots in the face of a dwindling state program aimed at preserving farmland during this fiscal year , the state budget for farmland preservation was cut 25 percent , to 3 million since the program was established in the 1970 s it has acquired 167 farms totaling 25 , 450 acres the goal is to preserve 130 , 000 acres of farmland we 're encouraging municipal efforts more than ever , because if we can show municipal support for the program , we can probably build a stronger case for more state support , mr dippel said the degree of commitment to farmland and open space preservation varies from town to town most towns have some mechanism for accepting farmland into trust , but very few have a funded program for the purchase of development rights , mr dippel said most towns do n't develop an appreciation for this type of program until there is little farmland left at that point , it s too late the land is going to be very expensive and difficult to farm because it s surrounded by subdivisions and other developed uses that are not going to appreciate the noise and odors associated with farming but many towns are moving forward more rapidly mr dippel said shelton has accepted gifts of land for preservation , and sharon has begun a program that will allow it to purchase development rights to farms and several towns have expressed an interest in a federal program that would allow sharing the cost of farmland preservation among the state , town and federal governments connecticut got 1 million under the program this fiscal year only california , pennsylvania and maryland got more richard d schultz , the planning and zoning administrator in shelton , said there were at least three dairy farms in town when he was growing up there , but the last one closed just last year there are fewer than 2 , 000 acres of active farmland left in town , which is the reason shelton is developing a preservation policy as part of its open space plan , and the aldermen recently adopted an agricultural land preservation fund i 've seen the suburban sprawl eat up a lot of our open space area , mr schultz said shelton is now primarily singlefamily homes on oneacre lots and a lot of the farmers who are left are at an age where they are getting ready to retire that s why it s imperative that each town have a plan , and a funding mechanism , so those property owners know they can go to public officials first avon is also considering a farmland preservation policy , said its town planner , steven m kushner there are four remaining farms in town , all large operations the owner of one is in his 80 s and none of his children want to run it , mr kushner said , and with building lots fetching 150 , 000 to 225 , 000 , there would be a lot of pressure on his heirs to develop that property the town wrote to the state department of agriculture to try to encourage that agency to purchase the development rights to the town s remaining farms , he said , but there has been no response
washington , jan 5 as a new congress convenes on tuesday vowing to cut taxes , tame medicare spending and balance the federal budget , many in the capitol believe the elements of success are in alignment for the first time in years , but only if the lawmakers can first deal with explosive ethical issues involving campaign finance and speaker newt gingrich the path of the new congress is likely to be charted in its first weeks , when the house is expected to hold extraordinary public hearings and debate the fate of mr gingrich perhaps a month later , in late february or early march , the senate governmental affairs committee will publicly investigate possible campaignspending abuses by the democratic party , the white house and , probably , by republicans as well but if congress can address such combustible issues without burning all bridges between the two parties , it could be extraordinarily productive , some leaders say the president has now said , 'look , i 've got all my politics behind me now i do n't have to operate from a political point of view , ' representative dick armey of texas , the majority leader , said today on the fox news sunday program 'let s get down to the legislative work' and he s anxious to do it , and we 're anxious to get back to it as well at the top of a legislative agenda nearly as ambitious as the one republicans brought with them two years ago are a balancedbudget amendment to the constitution , a binding plan to erase the deficit by 2002 , an overhaul of the federal healthcare system , and tax cuts for families , small businesses and investors democrats would add the partial restoration of welfare benefits cut by legislation that president clinton signed into law last summer some in both parties demand an overhaul of campaignspending laws much in the new congress augurs well for optimists there are lots of new faces 1 of every 5 members is a freshman , nearly as many as in 1994 excepting those house members who rose to the senate , none carries scars from the last four years of political garrotting on capitol hill the timing is also right at the white house , president clinton has been transformed from electionyear rival to lame duck in need of congress s help to win a place in history in the capitol , the populist fires that led republicans into disastrous confrontations in 1995 and 1996 appear banked the politics have changed , too the balance of legislative power has shifted to the senate , where the republican majority leader , senator trent lott of mississippi , likes to cut deals the house , where the november elections cut deeply into the republicans' dominance , is a chastened place where moderates of both parties may comprise the margins of victory or defeat you can do one of two things with a smaller majority , said representative david l hobson , an influential republican from ohio you can try to force all your people in line , which is very difficult to do or you can build more consensusoriented legislation and move it through he added , it 'll be less confrontational this time , it appears that remains to be seen in the house , many democrats believe little can be accomplished as long as mr gingrich remains speaker in the senate , mr lott s bent toward bargaining may be more than offset by the november election results , which vastly widened the ideological gulf separating republicans and democrats republicans not only increased their majority by two seats , to 55 , but also replaced a throng of moderates who had retired with conservatives from mr gingrich s takenoprisoners school of politics several come directly from the speaker s house ranks , including senators sam brownback of kansas , wayne allard of colorado and tim hutchinson of arkansas democrats not only lost some moderate seats to republicans , but also replaced some of their own moderates with more liberal members in states like georgia , louisiana and new jersey all that suggests that the 1997 senate will look a good deal more like the 1994 house more partisan , more ideological and less obliging to the dying tradition of comity another open question , at least in republican minds , is what will come of mr clinton s pledge to cooperate and compromise republican leaders have made it clear that they will not attempt politically difficult initiatives like changes in medicare or the costofliving index , unless the white house takes the lead memories of mr clinton s virulent attacks on the republicans' medicare plan last year are too fresh the budget , both sides say , will be the proving ground for many promises fiscal issues dominate the list of items that are likely to be addressed early if tradition holds , mr clinton will offer his proposed budget in early february for the 1998 fiscal year , which begins on oct 1 unlike the last two years , republicans may not dismiss it out of hand , because both parties purport to see a chance this year for agreement on a credible plan to erase the federal deficit , perhaps by 2002

when edward schwartz was 11 he earned 25 cents an hour working in his father s laboratory in the basement of the family home in white plains that was my first job , and in a sense i never left it , mr schwartz said mr schwartz , president of micropoint , a computer company in mount kisco , said the company began 31 years ago when his father , arnold schwartz , an acoustical engineer at cbs , began experiments to improve the device a stylus used by the recording industry to cut the grooves in master records at that time there were only two manufactures of styli on the market , he said working alone in his spare time , my dad developed a better technology and began designing very sophisticated , innovative equipment watching him make the tiny tools that shaped the sapphire styli , which are little rods of red sapphire , grown in labs , i was fascinated his tools were only the size of a pencil point with a cutting edge of onetenth the thickness of a human hair , ground to the tolerance of onemillionth of an inch , so when the time came to start a company to produce his styli , he named it micropoint the fledgling company was successful from the start as soon as the product came on the market , orders flowed in from recording studios all over the world , everywhere master records were made , mr schwartz said by that time dad had moved to a new facility in elmsford i joined him full time in 1978 and became president the next year when i was 26 , my dad died i never thought of selling since i had great respect for him and wanted to keep the company going for both of us to see how business could be increased , mr schwartz began interviewing customers customers were the ones who put me on the right path , he said they told me that our quality was slipping , so i redesigned and built new equipment , and almost immediately sales improved quickly and dramatically styli are a consumable item they only last for 10 hours , making reorders automatic so it was a very profitable business observing that when his father started marketing micropoint , only two other companies in the world one in the united states and one in japan were making the same product , mr schwartz said we had 75 percent of the world market however , the total market is very small , so we developed ancillary products to fatten sales we were a niche company in a niche market , but for me it was terrific to be so successful at an early age i traveled all over the world on business and met some great people at the abbey road studios of emi , where the beatles recorded and cbs atlantic records , which were all customers of ours it was exciting even iron curtain artists asked for our products , so i went there , too just as computers were coming on the market in 1981 , mr schwartz , a technology buff , bought a texas instrument pc for 5 , 000 and an audiospectrum analyzer that had a computer interface i wanted the ability to measure the quality of sound in order to show our customers how good our equipment was , he said but i could n't find a program none existed so with the help of a friend who was a programmer , i wrote a program to automate quality control of our styli then fate took a hand when micropoint exibited its stylus and test equipment at a trade show in manhattan , people were much more interested in the software program than the styli , mr schwartz recalled my software program was the star of the show and that is how we segued into the computer age , which turned out to be a salvation the company began hiring programmers to design software for test equipment , which was sold to audio companies and radio and television stations then a bizarre thing occurred , mr schwartz said one sunday , i was at work as usual , when i got a call from a vice president of citibank who needed a program in two weeks to take to japan the upshot was that i went back and forth to japan for a year , writing programs for them then i began getting assignments from other large companies and at the same time began to grow my company by selling software , hardware , accounting programs and computer networks to smaller companies in the westchester area meanwhile , he said , the recording industry began to fail compact disks were making records obsolete i knew we had to rethink and plan for the future , if we were to survive and thrive so in 1992 , after 25 years of manufacturing styluses , the stylus part of the business was sold we now are a fullservice computer company , providing creative solutions in virtually every area of the computer process for small and midsize businesses , under 20 million , in the westchester area , he said we have a lot of different experts on staff , including a cpa , a network engineer and experienced programmers describing micropoint s relationship with clients , mr schwartz said we fill the role of the inhouse technology expert we get to know every facet of a client s business , and everything we do is aimed at enhancing their operation using a client who markets playground surface materials as an example , mr schwartz said , we put in an accounting system and a program analysis that tracks sources for material , competitors' prices , shipping routes and finally determines the price just a little lower than the competition william scott , president of professional risk managers , a fullservice insurance agency in yonkers , is a micropoint client we 're a relatively new company , six years old , mr scott said we are heavily automated with a thirdparty software , and micropoint put together a strategy for our hardware and communication needs it s an excellent company , instrumental in leading the technological advancement of our firm by embracing new technology , mr schwartz said micropoint not only survived the demise of the recording industry but is also growing he plans to increase his staff to 25 from 10 soon i 've never been afraid to try new things , he said at 42 , i'm engaged to be married for the first time photo edward schwartz , left , with william scott of professional risk managers in yonkers \( chris maynard for the new york times \)
before there were superhero action figures and a zillion variations on barbie , before children s playthings were the effluvia of multimilliondollar movie promotions , toys were something real and solid and good toys were little firetrucks , printing presses , delivery vans and dolls to cherish as if they were babies they were ships and circus wagons , cap pistols and marbles , the same kind your parents and their parents had played with are you reading the nostalgic rantings of a cranky baby boomer , one losing a halfstep a year to two rambunctious sons \? well , so be it from the perspective of parents overwhelmed by the array of slick contraptions , conceptions and outandout confusions thrown at their children , yesterday s toys were ohsomuch nicer but they seem to have been more than that toys once functioned as a way to teach boys and girls how the world worked they were a way to mimic role models many came with a \( gasp ! \) moral message and if they were more real , the reality they encouraged was the one that parents more or less successfully demanded that children accept a quirkily charming exhibition at the south street seaport museum provides plenty of support for such selfrighteous parental nostalgia , right down to the mottoes printed on miniature printing presses to whit , active youth promotes robust manhood but there is also a larger thought toys are an incisive manifestation of society this point is persuasively argued by this small but intriguing exhibition , which is called city in play toys and the transformation of the city of new york , 18651945 the civil war had just ended , and soon would come the completion of the transcontinental railroad , the city s first elevated trains and its first telephones new yorkers born toward the close of the 19th century would see skyscrapers , automobiles , airplanes and moving pictures remake the city yet again there would be wars , depressions and , always , more people , as the world streamed here in restless search of something better this exhibition at the museum s melville gallery intends to tell what children were up to while all this was going on the objects are small and the display is understated you have to read the words the effect is to make you think in a portion of the exhibition called city in motion , the theme is the bustle of those longago streets as reenacted on contemporaneous parlor floors toys , whether handpowered pushpull models , windups or electricpowered , reflect the country s fascination with speed there is a hansom carriage , a donkey cart , a policeman atop a quaint motorcycle and a golden arrow racing car as the world becomes faster , so do the toys fires and the men who fight them have seemingly always stoked childish imaginations but in new york , the fascination grew in 1865 when a professional fire department replaced a volunteer one and horsedrawn firefighting equipment replaced human power the new highly polished rigs were a natural for toy makers to emulate there is a horsedrawn pumper , a fire patrol wagon from 1889 and a hookandladder truck from 1908 trains are another theme manhattan was linked by rail with the mainland in 1851 as railroads transformed the nation toys kept apace , as reflected by the sturdy castiron train sets on exhibit in this part of the show , there is a windup model of new york city with a train chugchugging around its perimeter , from the 1920 s the city s maritime history is illustrated by a section called gateway to the world , which includes round the world , an 1873 seafaring game , and a city of new york sidewheel steamer , circa 1903 the white squadron naval building blocks from 1892 look like fun a touch of whimsy is provided by a 1934 picture of the winners with their models at the 10th annual model sailboat races in central park once a year came wonderment , fantasy , unimaginable possibility , in the form of the circus hold your hosses the elephants are coming !

as a political organization , new york state s liberal party is a moribund shell but thanks to state election law , it is an extremely efficient vehicle for political shakedowns the time has come to change the rules the liberals and increasingly their opposite number , the conservative party do not field candidates of their own their business , and indeed the liberals' sole purpose for existence , is to crossendorse republicans or democrats since every candidate wants to be on the ballot as many times as possible , and to keep other names at a minimum , politicians are eager to make the tiny core of active liberal party members happy new york s election laws , which are written by republicans and democrats , actually discourage minor parties from running their own candidates any party whose gubernatorial candidate receives 50 , 000 votes wins an automatic place on the ballot the next time around experience shows it is much easier to get those votes by crossendorsing familiar names like mario cuomo or george pataki that rule should be changed the state should award an automatic line only to a party that wins 50 , 000 votes for a candidate any candidate who is a member unlike the democrats and republicans , leaders of the liberal party can hand over a nomination without worrying that their candidate might be defeated in a primary they can give their mayoral line to rudolph giuliani , a republican but under state law , only a registered liberal party member could challenge him for the slot in a primary there is a method for getting around this rule , but it is so daunting that no one in memory has managed to pull it off less than 1 percent of registered voters in new york city belong to the liberal party , and only a fraction of those are active members but the party s value on the ballot is demonstrated every year at its big fundraising dinner scores of elected officials , none of them party members , pay to hear guest speakers who are not members , like vice president al gore or mayor giuliani , praise politicians of the past like franklin roosevelt , who was not a member either raymond harding is the party s acknowledged leader , although not the titular head since mr giuliani was elected with the liberal endorsement , mr harding s circumstances have improved mightily his two sons hold highranking jobs in the administration his law firm s lobbying business has boomed mr harding himself has done so well financially in the last few years that he has been able to pay off a large debt to the internal revenue service he is one of the mayor s main unpaid advisers , a status that did not change when controversy arose over lobbying by mr harding s firm the party s ballot line is particularly important to mr giuliani , who must appeal to many democratic voters with an aversion to pulling the republican lever in the last election , mr harding s party provided mr giuliani s margin of victory three of the current democratic candidates for mayor have been endorsed by the liberal party in past elections , and it is conceivable that the party s membership might prefer one of them to mr giuliani , who also expects to be running on the conservative party line but because of state election laws , mr harding s decision on an endorsement is for all practical purposes final parties that endorse nonmembers should not be able to keep other nonmembers out of their primaries parties that endorse nonmembers should also not be rewarded with an automatic position on state ballots , while other third parties that field their own candidates have to go through the difficult process of collecting signatures election laws should be directed at encouraging competition , not rewarding tiny political cliques that regard their line on the election ballot as so much real estate , to be rented out to the highest bidder
in a wideranging indictment that implicates major associates of new york city s politically powerful police union , federal authorities charged yesterday that top officials of a sister union representing the transit police took kickbacks and engaged in several other schemes before the two unions merged in 1995 the racketeering and bribery indictments were immediately seized on by mayor rudolph w giuliani as a primary reason for his administration s failure to negotiate a new contract with the 38 , 000member police union on tuesday , that union , the patrolmen s benevolent association , rejected the city s last contract offer , leaving the talks with the influential union at an impasse as the mayor prepares to run for reelection pba officials declined to respond to the mayor s assertion that their legal troubles had undermined the talks but mr giuliani s comments underscored the deep rift that has grown between many police officers and the mayor , who plans to make the city s recordsetting drop in crime a central theme of his reelection campaign this year , the mayor will be in the uncomfortable position of running on his record as a crime fighter while having frayed relations with the police union and its restive members , who strongly supported his mayoral bid in 1993 \( news analysis , page b6 \) while the charges announced yesterday do not implicate pba officials , they do focus on the union that merged with the pba in may 1995 , the transit police benevolent association , which shared its lawyers with the city officers' union federal prosecutors charged that before the merger , the lawyers paid bribes to transit pba officials to keep the union s work one of the lawyers , james j lysaght , has been called the architect of the pba s strategy in the current contract talks further , federal investigators say that because of the links between the two unions , their inquiry will focus on the pba , which has been one of the most effective lobbying forces in albany and city hall for years the round of inquiries is likely to further complicate the union s efforts to get raises for members , who have gone without a pay increase for two years there s no question that today s indictments have had a very difficult effect on the ability of the city to communicate its message to the police officers of new york city , mr giuliani said in announcing the indictments of five people and guilty pleas of six others yesterday , united states attorney mary jo white said more charges might follow against some current and former city pba board members for their part in a moneylaundering scheme in that scheme , as outlined in yesterday s indictment , officials of several police unions essentially lent money to the campaign of a former transit pba president , ron reale , so that he could fraudulently qualify for city matching funds during his unsuccessful campaign for public advocate in 1993 mr reale was among those indicted yesterday an assistant united states attorney , andrew lachow , said more than 15 questionable donations to mr reale s campaign were made by city , transit and housing pba officials , their spouses and their friends , but it is unclear whether they will face criminal charges but other investigators , who insisted on anonymity , said the city pba was now likely to become the focus of the inquiry because mr lysaght and two other lawyers charged yesterday , peter l kramer and richard hartman , have also had multimilliondollar contracts with the city police union for years ms white would not discuss the possibility of indictments against current pba officials , saying only , we 're going to pursue this case as far as the evidence will take us a spokesman for the law firm of lysaght kramer , which is paid more than 5 million in taxpayer money and union dues each year to defend city police officers , said that the lawyers expected to be cleared of any charges we at our law firms have acted tirelessly and aggressively on behalf of police officers for many years , the spokesman , todd shapiro , said , and given our aggressive efforts , it s not surprising that we have made certain enemies , nor that these enemies would target us for this type of attack the investigation began two years ago , when top officials of the transit police union were accused of looting 265 , 000 from the union s coffers in the months before the may 1995 merger with the city pba in november two former transit pba officials , its former vice president , thomas zichettello , and a former treasurer , frank richardone , were charged with using union funds to buy luxury cars for themselves and their spouses another former treasurer , raymond montoro , began cooperating with federal agents , said law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity they added that mr montoro described how union officials demanded cash bribes of more than 300 , 000 from their lawyers and other vendors according to the indictment , which was filed by michele hirschman , head of the federal attorney s public corruption unit , transit pba officials paid lysaght kramer inflated fees for administering the union s health and welfare benefits fund , annuity fund and civil legal fund , and then demanded cash kickbacks of more than 300 , 000 mr zichettello , mr richardone and mr montoro all pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiracy and racketeering , ms white said transit pba officials are also charged with demanding similar kickbacks from the law firm of barry agulnick and william gogel , two other lawyers who represented transit police officers the two were also indicted on racketeering charges and yesterday pleaded guilty mr agulnick and mr gogel have also signed cooperation agreements with federal investigators , according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity the sixth person who pleaded guilty in the case yesterday was angelo golino , a car dealer and former transit pba vendor the most tantalizing aspect of yesterday s indictment were the charges filed against richard hartman , a former pba lawyer who is one of the most storied figures in local labor politics mr hartman was forced to resign as the lead pba lawyer in 1988 and forfeit his law license after he was caught taking 817 , 000 from union accounts to support his gambling habit during a grand jury proceeding by the manhattan district attorney s office in 1988 , prosecutors also presented evidence that mr hartman was involved in a kickback scheme and associated with organized crime figures , according to a letter his lawyer at the time , michael armstrong , later filed in court when the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , agreed to drop the charges against mr hartman in exchange for his forfeiting his law license , city pba officials quickly granted him a 2 million contract as a labor consultant and allowed him to act as the agent for the members' life insurance plan which generated an additional 2 million in commissions mr hartman s lawyer , stuart london , said his client denied wrongdoing but federal agents charged him yesterday with paying bribes to transit police union officials , who allowed him to act as the life insurance agent for union members joseph mancini , a union spokesman , said that none of the criminal charges against the lawyers involved its dealings with the city pba photo james k kallstrom of the federal bureau of investigation and united states attorney mary jo white announcing indictments of former top officials

hollywood , april 15 nine years after the birth of her benchmark television series , roseanne is exhausted the pop culture star who created roseanne sat slumped on a sofa in her manager s office the other day , saying she hoped to take a year off when the show ended in may , except for a threeweek engagement in new york city as , of all things , the wicked witch in the wizard of oz it s so weird i never identified with that nice girl dorothy , only with the wicked witch who has all this sinister wisdom , said roseanne , who has already begun rehearsals for her appearance in madison square garden from may 7 to june 1 she began laughing i grew up in salt lake city , a dark girl among all the blondes the wicked witch was so strong and outrageous oh , i love her for the moment , the finale of roseanne on may 20 after 224 episodes and 4 emmy awards consumes her few television shows or stars have blurred the line between art and life as does roseanne , and few sitcoms have defined the culture , or at least a part of it , as did this series about the workingclass connors of lanford , ill , whose children were n't destined for harvard , who were more anxious about keeping jobs than losing weight the show was about women , gender , politics , the working class , roseanne said emphatically did i think it would be successful \? i actually did because i knew it was filling a void beyond this , few television stars have been as defiant and outrageous as roseanne , a high school dropout who grew up poor in salt lake city , lived in an artists' colony near denver as a teenager , had four children by her early 20 s , worked as a cocktail waitress and window dresser , became a standup comic and barely eked out a living until she struck gold with roseanne she jokes about being a domestic goddess in a trailer park nobody has really been able to replicate the family or class thing on television and you know why \? she said pointedly because none of 'em are from there in recent weeks abc has turned down a deal with the carseywerner company , the producers , to bring back roseanne , whose ratings have slipped , for another season roseanne shrugs it off actually i was relieved , roseanne said everybody started rattling my chains , 'maybe we 'll do another season' i said , 'make me an offer i ca n't refuse' and they did n't so it s over my heart was n't in it anyway roseanne , now 44 , says she has been offered numerous proposals for a talk show and may do one and perhaps a film \( she starred with meryl streep in the poorly received shedevil in 1989 \) , but that she plans to take time off after the wizard of oz to write i'm so afraid of getting tricked into selling out that i 've totally isolated myself , said roseanne , who says she views herself primarily as a writer rather than a performer so i think i'm going to take a year or so to like , recharge and open up again , without saying anything , figure out what i'm supposed to say now wearing sneakers , shorts and a tshirt , roseanne sipped a diet soda and spoke cautiously at first , then bluntly , about the subjects that engage or annoy her these included what she views as the snobbishness of the women s movement \( they 're afraid of workingclass women , horrified of them \) , the condescension of male television executives \( i was the lone woman in their lives who did n't accommodate them , and you could see the meltdown \) , the impact of her show \( i see the ripples of it everywhere on other shows , on advertising , on politics \) , tabloid newspapers \( the tabloids have treated me like royalty i'm always in there , good or bad while the critics have generally treated me like trash \) , jackie gleason \( my ultimate god \) and success \( it s , like , isolating , and makes you feel like an alien from another planet , totally without any kind of fellowship \) as for her raucous reputation for abruptly dismissing writers and being abusive on the set , roseanne shrugged it off with some of them it was their first or second job , she said i would n't take pandering or garbage and i wanted everything to have meaning and so , like , these people who hated me the most went on to become millionaires she grinned roseanne s life is an open book , far too open , said some critics who view her with dismay once labeled the human tabloid in 1989 she was on more magazine covers in one year than anyone in history she describes a past that sounds like the plot of a soap opera after being hit by a car at the age of 16 , she was sent to a state psychiatric hospital for eight months at 18 , she dropped out of high school to live a bohemian life gave birth to a daughter , brandi , who was given up for adoption and surfaced years later married young and had three more children her second marriage , to the comedian tom arnold , was so tumultuous that even the tabloids seemed to be saying , enough ! there were stories about split personalities , assertions of childhood sexual abuse , drug and alcohol rehabilitation , a scandalous , crotchgrabbing rendition of the starspangled banner she underwent cosmetic surgery and wrote two best sellers two years ago she married her bodyguard , ben thomas they have a yearold son , buck
la grenouille is the most frustrating restaurant in new york this is not because the food is bad or the service unpleasant just the opposite , in fact in its 35th year , the restaurant is displaying such flashes of brilliance that each failure is a deep disappointment it could so easily be a fourstar establishment consider , for example , an early winter lunch we are greeted with a warmth i certainly do not recall from previous visits please come in , beams the maitre d'hotel as we are led to the rear of the room \( where nobodies are always seated \) , i ca n't help noticing that those seated in the favored front seem far younger than they used to be this cannot be marked down to improvements in cosmetic surgery , for these people are casually dressed has the clientele changed \? as we sink into our seats and admire the fabulous floral displays , our captain bustles about , making us comfortable handing us menus , he recites the specials with such enthusiasm he is hard to resist the chef has made a wonderful chilean sea bass with lamb sauce , he coos lamb sauce \? on sea bass \? yes , yes , he urges , it is wonderful do try it he also suggests that , in place of the skewered chicken livers listed on the menu , we try the chef s special chicken liver mousse in crayfishandshrimp sauce we do , and it is superb , the mousse softly pink and tender in a masterly seafood sauce he has also urged us to try the millefeuille of st jacques , lemony scallops beneath a clear disk of sesameencrusted pastry it is a delicate and beautiful dish , surrounded by tiny leaves of infant mache and bits of chervil the sea bass is simply extraordinary this is a rich fish with a subtle flavor and buttery texture surrounded by a luxurious sauce , onions and potatoes , the fish melts into something very much like marrow the chef has used the best quality of the fish , its texture , to create a tapestry of tastes poached chicken is memorable , too , a tasty bird served in a fine horseradish sauce complemented by both celery and celery root a light sprinkling of coarse salt emphasizes the taste and texture of the bird for dessert , there is a bitter chocolate tart with a barely sweetened , deep chocolate sorbet the depth of flavor makes this a chocolate for grownups a tarte tatin features apples cooked so that they maintain their integrity until touched by a fork , when they fall apart , dropping into a caramel sauce of surprising intensity the flavors are framed by a small cloud of creme fraiche sipping my coffee , i think how eager i am to return for dinner but when i come back a week later , the food is entirely forgettable sea urchins in the shell have been so ineptly opened that they crunch when i eat the tender flesh a sweetbread feuilletage is slightly soggy and the service is so sloppy that at one point i am offered an entree intended for someone else still , there are high points these include an appetizer of whole rouget stuffed with a shellfish mousse , and a dreamy pistachio souffle spooning up this airy confection , i realize that it is not for nothing that a parade of souffles crosses the dining room each evening i do n't think there is a better souffle in new york return visits have displayed the same lack of consistency in the kitchen each meal has offered moments of joyful excellence the terrine de foie gras in spiced

moscow , march 10 in the elegant estee lauder beauty center on the sumptuous grounds of the moscow country club , wealthy women fill empty lives with facials , massage and the kindness of beauticians to be honest , i am very lonely , elvira averyanova , 41 , confided in a soft whisper i am someone who needs human contact i try to go to places where i am known , and i am greeted warmly she cited the beauty center , her hairdressing salon and an upscale shopping mall as her havens from solitude the other her diary i write down all my thoughts and problems in my journal , she explained it is my best friend mrs averyanova , a trained pianist who gave up working and whose husband , a successful cd manufacturer , never stops , was describing a darker side of life among russia s new rich like many wives of successful businessmen , she is finding that money and privilege are shadowed by isolation , anxiety and boredom their complaints are entries from a diary of a mad russian housewife a new phenomenon in postsoviet society , such women represent less than 1 percent of the population the vast majority have little choice but to work millions are locked in deadend jobs and have not been paid in months there is little sympathy for the laments of ladies of leisure russia remains a highly sexist society , where women , regardless of marital or professional status , are rarely allowed a prominent public role despite , or perhaps because of , 70 years of soviet lip service to female equality , women distrust feminism the few who can afford the luxury of not working often find that option irresistible particularly when their husbands insist but many who happily quit their jobs quickly discovered that it was not the liberation they expected the stayathome wife has become an important status symbol for the new rich , but the prestige falls on the husbands far more than the wives psychologists , psychics and massage therapists have built flourishing practices ministering to such women sergei g agrachev , a leading psychologist , charges 60 an hour to guide wealthy patients , most women , through depression and the anxiety that often follows sudden wealth russians have their own special psychoses to work through , he said , issues of disillusionment that are unique to postcommunist society for 70 years , he said , we idealized the west now we discover that wealth really does n't buy happiness intelligent women who used to work in institutes and universities find themselves alone at home , entirely dependent on their husbands they find out that in this brave new world , their role has regressed to the 19th century he is not licensed to prescribe drugs , but he said many of his patients disregarded his advice , overindulging in valium and other tranquilizers prescribed elsewhere russian women do not usually accompany their husbands to business dinners or outoftown conferences nor do they attend social events on their own mrs averyanova , who taught piano until her husband insisted that she stop , said that although she yearned to go to art gallery openings and receptions , her husband was too busy to take her and she would not dream of going alone the social organizations that occupy affluent housewives in the west garden clubs , book clubs , even the pta have not yet taken hold in russia philanthropy , a relatively new thing here , is mostly handled by the tycoons who made the money and want credit for disbursing it volunteer work , common among the wives of foreign diplomats and businessmen in russia , has not yet caught on among russians the system is n't established here , said olga dubova , 48 , the wife of a top executive at logovaz , the country s largest car dealership we would love to do charity work , mrs dubova said but you ca n't just drop by a prison or a hospital there is a whole bureaucracy in the way she added that higherprofile charity work , fundraising or charity balls , was taboo raisa gorbachev annoyed the public by being too visible , mrs dubova said most husbands want to keep their wives in the shadows the closest thing to public scrutiny of their problems was a recent episode of the television talk show my family the topic was the new rich , and the program featured a masked man who said he was a gigolo for the wives of rich businessmen what you have to understand , he told the snickering studio audience , is that most of these women are really lonely their internal life is not as easy and comfortable as it appears on the outside like mrs averyanova , whose children are 21 and 13 and do not need much supervision , many find themselves tending an empty nest before they are even 45 trapped in prebetty friedan gilded cages , they seek solace in shopping , foreign trips and long hours at the hairdresser feelings of isolation are compounded by the grim realities of financial success in russia many have moved to highsecurity compounds in the suburbs bodyguards drive them to their appointments
london , april 28 on the eve of britain s most important election in years , the nation s economic indicators are flashing green after years of slashing payrolls , privatizations and big cuts in welfare under margaret thatcher s revolution , the economy has been growing steadily since 1993 last month , the government reported that unemployment was a slim 61 percent compared with doubledigits in france , germany and italy and half the level in britain a decade ago last year , growth here beat virtually every nation in europe with a solid 26 percent gain , not far behind the united states foreign banks and corporations have invaded the country , bringing an added boost attracted by low corporate taxes and a pool of skilled but relatively lowcost labor , hundreds of banks and legions of companies , including compaq , northern telcom and japanese auto makers , have landed here all that suggests an era of good feeling that should give the ruling conservative party an easy time but , in fact , the party is desperately behind in the polls most people here attribute it to the conservatives' nearly 18 years in power and a seemingly endless series of scandals moreover , in a contest focused more on personality than on policy , prime minister john major s bland , uninspired leadership makes tony blair and the new labor party seem almost visionary despite mr blair s vague we can do better generalities oddly that alone may be enough to tip the vote his way , poll takers say for while the national averages portray a booming economy best seen in london , they obscure two other worlds within britain where the pace of change has varied widely there is the world of shuttered factories , chronic unemployment and unsolved welfare problems and there is the world of slow but steady adjustments to new jobs that pay less almost everywhere , however , there is the notion that the conservatives have callously shrugged off the anxieties of many britons about the future of their jobs and questions about whether they can expect much from the government should they lose their work and no matter what the official numbers say , several leading economists contend and voters seem to believe that unemployment may be twice as high as the conservatives say because of some narrower definitions of true unemployment since the mid80 s , there has been a great increase in the number of families with no one working , said paul gregg , a senior research fellow at the london school of economics we 've had reasonable economic success , but large segments of society have systematically lost out , he said indeed , since lady thatcher took power in may 1979 , income for the poor has been flat or fallen , while income for the rich has soared 62 percent the income gap has never been wider at one end of the spectrum is glittering london , where the financial world is prosperous its biggest companies are reinvigorated global contenders tourism is up sharply , and fashionable , pricey hotels and restaurants are packed with business executives and vacationers but far from that whirl , are the other sides of the economy , where britons are struggling to cope with the difficult realities that thatcherism has wrought some industrial cities north of london , like birmingham , manchester and liverpool , have simply been left behind unemployment is high , and hopes for improvement are scarce similarly , scotland , which lost its shipbuilding industry , and wales , which lost coal mining and steelmaking in favor of lowercost competitors in asia and eastern europe , have lagged behind britain as a whole finally , there is the britain that is adjusting to the rigors of resurgent capitalism towns like bristol , reading and swindon have benefited from corporate money that has poured in , and people do not seem to fret much that the new jobs do not pay as well as the factory work their parents knew now , these three britains must pass judgment on the state of the nation in general elections on thursday and despite differences in their economic philosophies , none of the three , not even the socialist firebrands in liverpool , want to return to the what lady thatcher has called the dreadful conditions of the 1970 s what voters seem to want is a government that has a modicum of commitment to the havenots whom the tories largely ignored in one of the few concrete differences between mr blair and mr major , the labor party leader favors reinstating a minimum wage and adoption by britain of a series of modest worker and job protection measures , the social chapter of the european union s treaty on greater unification in previous elections , most voters rejected labor for fear of jeopardizing the economic gains now , the risk is gone mr blair says he believes in all the conservative freemarket principles and is promising something more a kinder , gentler approach to the downandout here is a look at the three britains one thriving , one struggling and one adjusting london where big money is nestled

terrorism has again dealt a blow to peace in the middle east the bombing of a tel aviv cafe yesterday killed three people , including the attacker the radical palestinian group hamas has claimed responsibility for the bombing , and the palestinian authority s president , yasir arafat , has denounced it there has been a lot of inflammatory rhetoric from mr arafat , king hussein of jordan and president hosni mubarak of egypt during the recent diplomatic standoff over new housing construction in east jerusalem and disagreements over the scope of israeli troop withdrawals in the west bank there is no provable link between their angry words and the bombing , but having repeatedly invoked the threat of violence , these arab leaders will now be blamed by many israelis for its actual occurrence that is even more likely given the so far unsubstantiated charges by israel s prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , made both before and after yesterday s bombing , that mr arafat has been releasing jailed terrorists and privately giving radical groups a green light to launch new attacks this is another of those delicate and dangerous middle east moments mr netanyahu s course since signing the hebron withdrawal agreement in january has infuriated even the most moderate arabs his decision to authorize construction of a new jewish housing project in east jerusalem came only days before negotiations were set to resume on matters including that city s future he decided on a minimally adequate troop withdrawal from occupied areas of the west bank with no show of consultation with mr arafat the palestinians then refused to cooperate in the withdrawals , and negotiations on jerusalem and other issues stalled none of mr netanyahu s maneuverings , however , can possibly justify the sacrifice of a single human life hard bargaining over the remaining issues is surely appropriate but reckless rhetoric can have deadly if unintentional consequences
the muddled message from a panel of experts last week on whether women in their 40 s should have mammograms to detect breast cancer is probably an accurate reflection of the muddled state of the scientific findings for this is a case where it is devilishly difficult to be certain of the risks and benefits the panel , convened by the national institutes of health , concluded that mammograms might indeed save a very small percentage of women from death but it warned that such mammograms might also harm some women through radiation or by leading to unnecessary surgery or false complacency with all such calculations of probabilities open to challenge , the panel shied away from a blanket recommendation that all women in their 40 s have mammograms , as is universally advised for women 50 and older instead , the panel concluded that women in their 40 s should make that determination individually , in consultation with their doctors the decision was denounced by the head of the national cancer institute and by many radiologists and cancer experts but it was deemed sensible by some women s health advocates concerned about unnecessary tests and treatment on balance , the panel may well be right to make this decision a matter of individual choice breast cancer is the leading cause of death of american women age 40 to 49 but advice on how such women can best protect themselves has been mixed the american cancer society recommended in 1983 that all women have mammograms every couple of years between the ages of 40 and 49 during the next decade that recommendation became the standard and was accepted by the national cancer institute but in 1993 , the cancer institute rescinded its advice because experts could not agree on the value of routine screening of women in their 40 s the latest panel was appointed after studies in sweden seemed to show that regular screening of women between 40 and 49 could indeed reduce the breast cancer death rate by 16 percent many years later but the panel discounted the importance of these findings the swedish studies are the heart of the current debate and will require further analysis by other expert groups in calculating benefits , the panel noted that mammograms might save the lives of 10 out of 10 , 000 women age 40 to 49 who were screened each year , or might save none at all but the xrays miss about 25 percent of invasive cancers in that age group , and a huge percentage of the lumps they do detect are tiny tumors that may or may not develop into cancer yet many doctors take aggressive action , removing the lump and sometimes even the entire breast , subjecting some women to unnecessary surgery that carries risks of its own the panel also noted that the radiation in mammograms might actually cause cancer in a small percentage of women age 40 to 49 as a result of the uncertainties , the panel left it to individual women , with the help of their doctors , to weigh factors like family history and changes noted during selfexaminations to determine whether and how often to have a mammogram before age 50 the panel quite rightly urged that insurers cover the costs of mammography for women who want it it makes no sense to compound the medical uncertainties with anguishing insurance uncertainties
atlantic city , sunday , feb 23 arturo gatti and tracy harris patterson picked up here at the atlantic city convention center early this morning where they left off two years ago at madison square garden and just like in their first encounter , this fight was close and actionpacked and gatti won , scoring a unanimous decision to retain his international boxing federation junior lightweight championship gatti won the title in his first fight against patterson beside being filled with action , the fight also contained a few moments of controversy , such as patterson s first round knockdown of gatti that was not ruled a knockdown by referee rudy battle and patterson s slip in the ninth round that battle did rule a knockdown in the end gatti raced around the ring like a man who had found gold at the end of a rainbow and patterson wore the dejected look of a man who had just lost his fortune to a swindler who had left town without a trace gatti was coming off surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left hand near his wrist the two fighters were supposed to meet last september , but gatti s injury , which he suffered in training for the bout , postponed the fight gatti had been out of the ring for 225 days before meeting patterson this morning four months ago he weighed as much as 160 pounds , but weighed in at 130 on friday for the junior lightweight bout against patterson none of it affected him against patterson gatti \( 271 \) , who entered the ring to the theme from rocky , did not come out like an underdog he came out swinging and so did patterson \( 5751 \) they picked up where they left off in the last fight , in which patterson mounted a furious rally in the late rounds but still lost his title to gatti in the first round tonight gatti staggered patterson with a right hand to the side of the head but patterson came back and stunned gatti with a straight right and then floored him with a shot along the belt line , which battle ruled a low blow patterson , who said he wanted to be more active in this fight than he was in the last one , settled into a defensive mode in the third and fourth rounds but he was able to land enough blows to gatti s head to cause a considerable amount of swelling to develop under his left eye in the fourth round patterson landed a heavy barrage of punches that rocked gatti in the sixth round , but gatti weathered the storm at one point in the round gatti nailed patterson and patterson motion with his gloves for gatti to give him his best shot in the eighth round gatti had a point take away for continuous low blows , after he threw a punch that landed on patterson s thigh battle had given gatti at least three warnings before taking away the point battle ruled an apparent slip by patterson in the ninth round as a knockdown by gatti patterson threw a right that missed and as he was going forward , he slipped in the other title bout that preceded the main event angel \( diablo \) manfreddy \( 2021 \) of gary , ind , survived a 10th round knockdown and defeated wilson rodriguez \( 4493 \) of madrid with a unanimous 12round decision to retain his world boxing union junior lightweight championship manfreddy opened a deep cut over rodriguez s left eye in the second round , but it did not affect his vision and it was not bad enough to stop the bout toney wins in connecticut montville , conn , feb 22 \( ap \) james toney continued his mastery of mike mccallum , winning a unanimous decision and capturing the lightly regarded world boxing union cruiserweight title tonight at the mohegan sun casino in montville , conn toney \( 5432 \) has twice beaten mccallum \( 4951 \) and also fought him to a draw in 1991 the judges steve epstein and kevin mccarl had toney winning , 115113 larry hazzard jr had toney winning by 117111 toney , who fights out of ann arbor , mich , supplied most of the power punches in the bout , loading up on the right hand and landing several clean shots on mccallum s chin a cut developed over mccallum s left eye in the eighth round in fort lauderdale , fla , nate miller successfully defended his world boxing association cruiserweight title by stopping alexander gurov in the second round miller , 304 with 26 knockouts , proved too much for gurov \( 1821 \) , a ukrainian now living in paris , scoring at will with solid combinations to the head the combinations resulted in three secondround knockdowns and the eventual stopping of the fight for miller of philadelphia it was the fourth successful defense of the title he captured in july 1995
piscataway , nj , jan 26 it took more than 39 minutes for the best point guard to step forward when he did , it surprised no one early in the game it looked as if it might be rutgers guard earl johnson then his teammate geoff billet then maybe seton hall s levell sanders all three turned in splendid efforts , but none are shaheen holloway the pirates' 5foot10inch freshman guard walked the ball up the court with 47 seconds left the scarlet knights held a 7270 advantage , but the pirates had rutgers and the ball right where they wanted them holloway stopped and took a 3pointer from three feet beyond the arc , not exactly what seton hall coach george blaney had called for holloway swished it , giving the pirates a 7372 lead that shot and two free throws by donnell williams moments later lifted seton hall to a 7572 victory today at the louis brown athletic center holloway had done it again no surprise the shot of the game was definitely shaheen s , blaney said it took a lot of nerve and a lot of courage for the first time all game the 7 , 526 fans fell silent johnson , who was guarding holloway , could not believe it either but 46 seconds remained , an eternity in a game as close as this one the scarlet knights had one more chance to tie the score , but a poor shot by billet with five seconds remaining and a big rebound by williams as time expired gave the pirates their first big east road victory in more than a year seton hall improved to 810 over all and 36 in the big east , while rutgers dropped to 78 and 36 holloway finished with 23 points and 6 assists his backcourt partner , sanders , hit a clutch 3pointer with 4 minutes 10 seconds left to cut the rutgers lead to 6866 sanders finished with 8 points , 11 rebounds and 6 assists williams , who made five 3pointers , finished with a gamehigh 27 points and 7 rebounds i wanted to take the bigtime shot , holloway said it was a perfect shot and the perfect time it was right in the middle i was n't making my foul shots so i just thought , 'they let us take this shot' so i did holloway s shot put the wind back into the pirates' sails something they had been waiting for since they had a 5756 lead midway through the second half i 've always said that shaheen came in as one of the most experienced players i 've ever seen , blaney said he s never been a basketball freshman rutgers , which led by 3733 at halftime , came out running in the first half but slowed down considerably in the second neither team was able to take too big a lead the scarlet knights , who have lost three straight games and five of their last six , squandered 7point leads twice , at 3124 and again at 6760 that was a good college basketball game , rutgers coach bob wenzel said it was intensely played by everyone unfortunately , we got the short end of the stick today everybody who was in that game was giving their best and their all it was a terrific game terrific for the guards , especially holloway and sanders ran the court as if they owned it in the second half billet and johnson , despite collecting some respectable statistics , gave too much ground and it cost them the game billet , who committed a careerhigh seven turnovers , finished with 22 points and a seasonhigh seven assists combined with johnson s 18 points , it was their biggest offensive production of the season but it was n't enough photo seton hall s bayonne taty , left , and duane jordan , right , vying for the ball with rutgers s sam sanders \( mary dibiase blaich for the new york times \)

when the paul taylor dance company went to india last month , it tried to expect the unexpected the troupe brought along two understudies , who could step in if someone got sick likewise , in case the electricity failed during a performance , the dancers arranged to gather backstage by candlelight until power was restored yet none of these measures prepared the company for the acoustical glitch that it ran into at the siri fort auditorium in new delhi during the last section of mr taylor s musical offering , a dance that is set to the fugal intricacies of j s bach , the recorded score suddenly went silent the 14 dancers on stage at the time had no way of knowing why the music stopped they did n't have much time to think about it either , although there were important decisions to make should they continue dancing \? certainly , as long as the lights stayed on , but beyond that the possibilities diverged would they have to finish the piece to the sound of their own footsteps , or would the music resume \? if so , would it begin where it left off , or later in the score \? it was frightening at first , but then it became a puzzle for us , said patrick corbin , who spent four seasons with the joffrey ballet before joining the taylor company in 1989 the choreography did n't allow for much head movement , so instead of looking around to make eye contact , we communicated with a kind of sixth sense honestly , i was picking up signals from other dancers with the hairs on the back of my neck meanwhile , backstage , technicians traced the problem to a faulty generator that supplied electricity to the amplifiers when they restarted it , after 81 seconds , the theater again resounded with the lush , lyrical strains of bach the audio disk drew its power from another source , so because it had never stopped playing , the dancers found themselves almost exactly on cue after moving in silence for more than 50 measures , they were just two counts ahead of the beat that the troupe responded so capably in new delhi is a testimony to its remarkable cohesion , a trait that does not come easily in a professional world that fosters such intense individual competition many of the taylor dancers , who begin a twoweek season at city center on tuesday , are talented enough to be stars in other companies but mr taylor spreads solos and other featured roles more widely among his dancers than most choreographers do , an approach that precludes stardom while allowing everyone to shine in his or her own way by encouraging us to be individuals , paul s work disperses the negative energy that might otherwise take over , said francie huber , who is , after nine years with mr taylor , the company s senior member despite their wholesome reputation , the taylor dancers are no strangers to the petty jealousies that arise within any group of performing artists they spend as many as 30 weeks each year on the road together , sharing hotel rooms and fending off jet lag between tours they rehearse 25 hours a week , often under pressure to learn new dances but the company , now in its 43d year , has proven adept at handling prolonged interaction it takes a while to build trust and communicate without words , said rachel berman , who has danced with the troupe for eight years but when crisis strikes , we know we can stick together after returning from india , mr taylor and his dancers took a week off , then set to work in their soho studio preparing for the city center engagement the first order of business was to refine eventide , a new dance with five duets the exercise underscored how the choreographer treats his dancers as individuals , whether they are in leading roles or the corps mr taylor said he paired dancers according to seniority and height , but as the couples swept across the floor , their builds and mannerisms allowed for a clever study in contrasts there was thomas patrick , a stocky and jovial dancer , partnering the demure and willowy caryn heilman andrew asnes , who exudes patrician poise , danced with the short and spunky ms berman strong , distinct personalities are a hallmark of the taylor company , and one of the reasons it epitomizes much of modern dance in america more than 100 dancers have passed through the company since its first concert in 1954 , among them the choreographers pina bausch , twyla tharp , dan wagoner and david parsons i want my company to be a collection of individuals who represent the variety in the world , mr taylor said a microcosm of the globe his current crew of 16 is a peaceable bunch , but there are occasional squabbles ms huber spoke of a tiff she once had with a fellow dancer the matter went unresolved until a rehearsal of esplanade required ms huber to work closely with her antagonist a few moments into the dance , an exhilarating piece that is one of mr taylor s most popular , the resentment faded in the context of what we were trying to do on stage , she said , the other stuff became meaningless
washington , july 14 he has been no 1 he has come unstrung and this week andre agassi , 30th in the world rankings but trapped in what he describes as a vapor lock , is back out on the tennis court he is learning to crawl again after a twoyear spiral from the peak of a profession that continues to daunt and haunt him crawling does not come easily , particularly before a public that finds it hard to believe that such stars would do something so mundane but that s what it feels like , agassi said today as he hunkered , a tad resignedly , on a sofa in the presidential suite he is sharing with his bride of three months , brooke shields marriage has been a godsend , but agassi and the tennis gods are still at odds i'm very challenged by it , by this starting over , said agassi , 27 sometimes it makes me happy with myself in a calm way , sometimes in a sick , demented way , but at the end of the day , i feel like i went out there , hit the ball and had a purpose i 've played this game for a lot of reasons , and none of them have ever quite been my own , but this time my desire is to get out there and enjoy it it s not easy , but at least i have a plan , and i think i'm making progress his return to duty wednesday night at the legg mason tennis classic , after a 70day hiatus , may signify progress , but it is not yet a pretty process the ultimate for me is to win another of the slams , to be a threat to my opponents , and to be at an event because i plan on winning it , said agassi , who has won three grand slam events and fallen in the finals of four others when i'm at my best , i'm winning slams , but the last thing i'm thinking about right now is winning slams i'm just trying to get back to the point where i can win matches even if he has to crawl back to that point \? believe me , i'm much more at risk of leaving this game when i'm on top than i am when i'm down and out , he said i do n't like the feeling of being beaten by something so this afternoon , agassi toiled in the steamy heat on a practice court at the event he selected for his latest reentry to tennis it has been a dismal year that has seen him post an uninspiring 46 record on the atp tour and turn up missing at all three grand slam events some of his troubles are traceable to recurring twitches in the wrist he had surgically repaired three years ago agassi would rather take a seat on the sideline than risk more surgery , hence his sluggish return to action after the wrist acted up in atlanta i knew it would be a nightmare to deal with that many balls on the clay , so that s why i avoided the french open , and then without enough play , i felt like i was n't ready for wimbledon , said agassi , who won his first grand slam title there in 1992 as for naysayers who think he is using the wrist as a surrogate for a twitchy temperament that no longer hungers for fulltime tennis , agassi worked up a mild case of indignation if i want to avoid tennis , i wo n't play , period , he said but i'm here to play and i'm here because i chose to be i do n't care what people think my motivation is i just want to play tennis , be in the thick of it , without feeling like i have to prove everything to the whole world agassi has to prove to himself that this return to the courts is the right decision done in the right way i mean , let s face it , it s been two years since i was really a contender for slams , he said the last time he was , he went into the united states open unbeaten on the summer hardcourts in 1995 and obsessed with defending the title he seized in 1994 things were different then he was no 1 , and it was up to pete sampras to stop him in the final when sampras did , agassi s slide began losing in a final that way , with your body so beat up that you ca n't give your best on the day it counts most , it sucks the spirit out of you , he said for a while he sulked , put tennis on the back burner and concentrated on making a life with shields , whom he married in april and with whom he hopes to start a family this year he inched back into competition by reaching the semifinals at san jose in february , put in a weekend of heroics at the davis cup quarterfinal against the netherlands , then played wallflower until the hardcourts season began this week today agassi sweated through an expletivelaced practice session with justin gimelstob , the young american whom agassi s coach , brad gilbert perhaps unsure of his main client s resolve has taken under his wing for the summer while crowds of kids ignored actual matches elsewhere to watch the bareheaded , blueshirted agassi , he went through his paces irritably once , he broke a racquet across his foot and flung it over the fence recently , sampras , who collected his 10th grand slam championship at wimbledon a week ago , lamented the absence of agassi the game really needs him a lot he s the one guy that puts tennis on the front page of the sports page , sampras said but i think he 'll come back he s a tennis player agassi wishes he could be that sure i miss that rivalry we had as much as pete does , but right now these are the facts i 've got to face that as pete s resting up after winning wimbledon for the fourth time , i'm here in dc getting ready to play round 1 of the legg mason , agassi said the facts are that you only start to be your best when you 're winning match after match , and like it or not , i'm a long way from that but with me , things can change in a hurry photo after concentrating less on tennis and more on brooke shields , whom he married in april , andre agassi is trying to return to the top of his game \( associated press \)
east rutherford , nj as the last of his teammates left the dressing room yesterday , the veteran giants linebacker corey miller sat on a stool in front of his dressing stall and spoke passionately about the blossoming of a new season miller spoke so convincingly , with so much verve , that you almost wanted to shout , pull out the pads ! let s play today instead the giants have to wait for sunday s home opener against philadelphia the expectations in this locker room are so high , miller said we believe wholeheartedly , no ifs and or buts , that we 're going to win football games , we 're going to be a playoffcaliber team that sounds good , but the giants' 1121 record the last two seasons suggests a waitandsee posture who are these giants \? until they prove otherwise , the giants are a team with no fingerprints , a faceless unit of interchangeable parts , none of which worked too well in the recent past for eight months everything has been jets , jets , jets in bill parcells , the jets , who were 115 last season , at least have a dominating persona in fact , parcells is more compelling as a jet than he was as a giant and instead of joe namath with a mink coat , the jets have keyshawn johnson with a controversial book the buzz is loud the giants hear it , though they say they pay it no mind it s understandable , miller said parcells is going to get that press because people are looking at him as the shepherd who s going to save the flock the attention is over there , and to be honest that s good because people are n't expecting much out of you maybe the attention lavished on the jets does n't bother the giants , but it should the jets have found a way , in the short run , to win back fans the giants have a captive audience of season ticket holders who are there in body , but not as much in spirit as they have been in the past with good reason the only current name that leaps out at them is dave brown , for all the wrong reasons the names that still have meaning taylor , carson , simms , parcells assume a deeper , haunting resonance with each successive losing season miller knows this is true he knew it in last week s exhibition game against green bay when packer fans in madison , wis , practically blew the stadium apart with unadulterated passion for the home team the energy the fans produced was great , he said they were in the game , and when fans are in the game it raises the player energy level that s what s got to happen in giants stadium again we have to win back media , win back fans we 've got to win again this game is n't fun if you 're not winning the giant locker rooms of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s had distinct power centers , harry carson and lawrence taylor from the defense and phil simms from the offense this new giants locker room for too long has been filled with young players just trying to make the team , trying to hang on forget about assuming a leadership role miller , who is now in his seventh season , was one of them i just wanted to be ok , he said i think this whole team has raised its level of expectations this year you still hear those names when you 're around an organization with a rich tradition you 're going to hear that but that s in the past , it s history , miller said we have to set a standard for ourselves we ca n't be the '90 giants , but we can be something different there is only one way to forge a new identity in this league , miller said it boils down to one thing winning when you win , you create an identity when you lose , there s nothing miller expressed the optimism of august , when everyone is 00 and every scenario even a super bowl seems plausible later , tyrone wheatley , the thirdyear running back , provided a more sobering perspective everyone is gung ho now , wheatley said the challenge comes when we 're winning , will we keep going \? if we lose , will we bow our heads , or will we fight back \? wheatley is attempting to answer his own question he has already suffered his first setback he lost what he thought would be his starting position to the rookie tiki barber the dress rehearsals are finished the rhetoric is history can the giants step from behind the veil of anonymity and forge a new image \? a winning image \? will the jets , for all the hype and hope , be the same old jets \? the clock is ticking photo corey miller \( associated press \)
to the editor your jan 15 frontpage article on the sanctioning of extreme fighting in new york state quoted representatives of the seg sports corporation , a promoter of the sport here is a reason to support extreme fighting i bet even they have not considered young people ought to know what a real fight looks like action movies , pro wrestling and cartoons portray fisticuffs as exciting , longlasting duels in which none of the combatants are seriously injured anyone who has witnessed real fights knows they are clumsy , brutal and short no matter how much promoters try to glamorize this stupid pastime , the events should reveal to spectators that fighting ought to be avoided thomas j callahan johannesburg , jan 16 , 1997
i felt the article suit threatens '98 track games \( feb 2 \) captured valid points from both sides however , i must take umbrage with the comments by donald rechler , the head of reckson associates , which owns the omni building mr rechler alludes to a professional soccer league utilizing the permanent stadium , which i assume refers to the rough riders , the only professional soccer team on long island and tenants at the former mitchel athletic complex obviously mr rechler is not familiar with our home schedule , since he refers to afternoon games during business hours and two to three game nights a week in reality , the rough riders play a 14game regular season home schedule , of which only three are played midweek , and all home games are played at 7 30 pm \( none during business hours \) also , as the owner of the omni building , i wonder if mr rechler is familiar with the fact that three of the building s tenants are current sponsors of the rough riders these tenants spend good money to advertise their services during our games , and include omni tenants healthsouth , national sports medicine orthopedic group and omni athletic club my guess is that mr rechler is unfamiliar with the support we receive from his own tenants and i wonder if his reaction would be the same william f manning general manager long island rough riders plainview
ann arbor , mich the inspector general s report criticizing the federal bureau of investigation s renowned crime laboratory points to a problem in law enforcement that should concern all americans , not just lawyers according to the report , fbi agents working on such big cases as the world trade center and oklahoma city bombings produced flawed scientific reports and slanted their findings to favor the prosecution in at least one instance , an agency supervisor allowed such evidence to be presented to the court , even when he knew the scientific evidence did not support the findings even more disturbing , the fbi assigned someone who was known to have produced flawed reports to the oklahoma city bombing case when the people we entrust to enforce our laws start bending the truth particularly scientific evidence that few of us can afford to test on our own none of us is safe the importance of the fbi s forensic lab work cannot be overestimated the laboratory s 600 staff members perform more than 600 , 000 examinations a year , and their findings are often crucial to both federal and state criminal cases the fbi s findings have rarely been questioned in court because the defense bar trusted the lab , and because expert witnesses for the defense are prohibitively costly when i was a public defender in new york city , most of my colleagues believed that the fbi was above reproach and that it would be a waste of time to hire an expert to get a second opinion even if we could afford to do so few lawyers believed fbi agents would report findings without an adequate scientific basis , let alone give inaccurate or misleading testimony in court even when the defense can hire an outside expert , fbi testimony is notoriously difficult to challenge when prosecutors call experts to the stand , they invariably ask questions intended to establish the witnesses' credentials and extensive experience , thereby giving the testimony an aura of reliability the seal of the fbi did more than that it lent the witness an aura of near infallibility when i defended mohammed salameh against charges that he helped build the bomb that exploded at the world trade center , i retained the services of a leading british bomb expert to review the fbi findings he pointed out many flaws and briefed me thoroughly before my crossexamination of an fbi forensics expert when i confronted the expert with the discrepancies , he simply responded that he performed the tests in accordance with standard fbi operating procedures the reputation of the bureau in most jurors' minds was such that i felt i made little headway if the fbi gave inaccurate and incomplete testimony in such a closely watched case as the world trade center trial , it is alarming to think what it was doing in less closely watched cases the misconduct of the lab could conceivably result in new trials for the world trade center defendants , costing taxpayers millions of dollars , and may greatly handicap the prosecution s case in the oklahoma city bombing trial but the misconduct raises an even more disturbing prospect juries must have faith in scientific evidence in order to make correct decisions for more than six decades , the laboratory has been a symbol of the fbi s commitment to scientific truth if the agency cannot be a trusted arbiter of such evidence , who can \? drawing \( art hughes \)

philadelphia asked to name famous opera roles or arias for women , most musiclovers mention ones for soprano mimi , aida , brunnhilde music for mezzosoprano springs to mind less quickly the character sung by the mezzo is usually the maid or the confidante romantically , she is out of the loop range and character roles are less fixed in art songs , which are routinely transposed into various keys marietta simpson , the mezzo whose recital in montclair on sunday afternoon concludes the unity concerts season , is to sing mostly artsong repertory , with emphasis on familiar songs transposed into keys that fit her range the mezzosoprano sings in a lower range than a soprano and , more significantly , with a deeper timbre the term mezzo , like mezzanine , connotes a place between the lower

was ill she has continued a career path , mostly in oratorio and art song , that continuously nets her descriptive terms in print like rich , ripe , simplicity and dignity , marian anderson and porgy and bess robert shaw engages her regularly he chooses light , smoothly focused voices with a particular accuracy and sheen the sylvia mcnair or john aler sort of voice when ms simpson sang in mendelssohn s elijah under mr shaw in carnegie hall in february , other soloists were savaged in print , but she came out with goldstar reviews oratorios usually have a quartet of soloists , in which ms simpson sings with modest manner , but the solidity of her support and blend allows the listener to exhale with satisfaction and trust i do n't seek reviews , she said in an interview here , but i do read them and have friends who seek them you ca n't wear a good one like a wreath , and you ca n't wear a bad one like a coat you 're reading one person s opinion you 've got to laugh which she does , easily and heartily she has sung elijah solos in their original english so often that one would expect her to be on automatic pilot , the way young violinists can be in mendelssohn s eminor concerto but she has just returned from singing it in a german translation , with the st louis symphony under hans vonk i feel like i 've grown up with it , she said but now i have to learn it all over again things are different rhythmically with german words , and there are a couple of different notes there is n't anything i could sing on auto pilot on this afternoon s program , the opening bellini arias warmups , really about do it for opera literature then it s on to groups with schubert s an die musik , tchaikovsky s none but the lonely heart , ives s circus band , copland s simple gifts and a number of spirituals , to be announced spirituals come at the end , ms simpson explained , because they are often selected after the program is printed , and the casual introduction fits the folk element it s the last style , she said if there were a broadway group , i would do that last a philadelphian educated at temple university , ms simpson majored in trombone she was one of a family of eight children who donned choir robes and piled into a station wagon as the singing simpsons , a family act spurred by their pianoplaying father mom preached she vividly recalls the aversion with which her family regarded new york city , where her sister joy attended the juilliard school it was sin city , peopled with barroom women in feather boas like the ones joy often wore in performance at joy s recital debut in alice tully hall , three busloads of church members came along in 1987 , ms simpson lost two older sisters in four months joy , remembered as a soprano fulfilling a promising musical future , died of an aneurysm at age while on tour in south africa , and claudette , a teacher , died of natural causes at 42 joy was the most flamboyant character in a family of characters , and she introduced the family to classical music , insisting that marietta study singing in graduate school she was the pusher for all of us , ms simpson said another sister , evelyn simpsoncurenton of seattle , sometimes plays piano for her recitals i 've faced obstacles and adversity , ms simpson said her marriage ended when she noticed that you 're walking up to your house ,

, we cried so hard as ms simpson s 40th birthday looms on the far horizon , she thinks about finding the right moment and role to move her toward the metropolitan opera she is also resolved to travel to south africa , to work through her sorrow about joy grief washes over you and comes from nowhere , ms simpson said you experience tears and pain it seems like it would be great if you had none ,

the good news for the united states open was that controversy was missing from its draw this year the nasty news was that boris becker s name was missing , too the draw was conducted yesterday at 10 30 am in the ballroom of a manhattan hotel seven hours earlier , a fax from germany had arrived in the office of the tournament director , jay snyder , announcing that becker was withdrawing because of the death of his manager and confidant , dr axel meyerwolden becker , who would have been seeded 13th here , had already withdrawn from this week s mfs us pro tennis championships in boston to attend meyerwolden s funeral in munich , germany , where the sports agent died of liver cancer on monday at the age of 56 i'm not surprised by boris s decision , snyder said considering that it was someone who was practically part of the family , i think any top athlete would have withdrawn , even from an event of this magnitude it remains unclear whether the 29yearold becker will play singles in another grand slam event after losing in the quarterfinals to pete sampras at wimbledon last month , he announced he would not play wimbledon again and did not plan to play any grand slam events next year because he no longer felt he had the potential to win a twoweek event in which matches are three of five sets becker has won six grand slam singles titles he won the united states open in 1989 and reached the semifinals in 1986 , 1990 and again in 1995 , when he lost to andre agassi in four sets in what may have been his last match at flushing meadows he missed last year s open after injuring his wrist it s very sad , snyder said we 're missing both german champions , and they both are very much part of this event the other absent german champion , steffi graf , who has won the open the last two years and five times over all , will miss at least the rest of the season after undergoing major surgery on her left knee in june that leaves sampras as the only twotime defending champion in queens , and judging from the look of yesterday s draw , he wo n't be leaving early he will meet a qualifier to be named in the first round , another in the second and either richard fromberg of australia , patrick mcenroe of cove neck , ny , alex radulescu of germany or another qualifier in the third round none of those names should cause the world s no 1 player great concern there are three qualifiers after pete s name , but jay says he did n't fix the draw , said tom gullikson , the american davis cup captain considering last year s draw difficulties , gullikson s crack was n't guaranteed to make snyder smile last year , the outgoing united states tennis association president , les snyder , irked many european players by deciding to borrow a page from wimbledon and not have the open seedings follow the men s computer rankings more concerns were raised when the usta announced the men s seedings after the other players had been placed in the draw , which gave the appearance of manipulation while maintaining that no malice or manipulation was intended , the new usta president , harry marmion , acknowledged on tuesday that the incident was very hurtful to the tournament s reputation this year , the computer rankings became the seedings , and the seedings were announced before the draw began i regret the appearance last year , jay snyder said but i do n't regret the fact we took such a comprehensive look at the seedings , and we may still do that in the future while sampras should cruise early , other prominent men might not jim courier , unseeded here for the first time since 1989 , will face his friend and fellow american , todd martin , a former topfive player and open semifinalist , who has not played a tournament since undergoing elbow surgery in february other intriguing matchups include morocco s explosive karim alami versus australia s even more explosive and 14thseeded mark philippoussis , and austria s fifthseeded thomas muster against britain s tim henman the most enticing women s firstround matches include nicole arendt versus fifthseeded amanda coetzer , and jennifer capriati against seventhseeded conchita martinez
when henry j lyons was only 12 , his family minister told him that he would one day become president of the nation s largest black religious denomination , making him a powerful and nationally respected figure among millions of baptists across the country so it was with the air of a man certain of his command that he ascended the familiar pulpit of bethel metropolitan baptist church on a recent sunday , his baritone voice resonating the church is not a museum for saints , he declared in a sermon to more than 300 approving congregants in st petersburg , fla it s a hospital for sinners ! despite mr lyons s confident tone , questions have been sweeping through the denomination he leads , the national baptist convention usa inc , since the disclosure that his wife set fire on july 6 to a waterfront house she believed he shared with another woman the arson has laid bare mr lyons s lavish way of life and his close relationship with a woman who has a history of theft , debt and aliases but more than that , it has provoked an extraordinary amount of public criticism and soulsearching within one of the most prominent religious associations in the country baptist leaders are questioning the group s finances and saying that the latest controversy is another example of how the denomination has squandered its potential as a major force on religious and civil rights issues referring to a history of autocratic leadership , the rev moses javis , of jacksonville , fla , a minister who has pushed for change , said past presidents would justify an action by saying that it was god s will , a potent claim among the devout in other words , the president becomes the pope , mr javis said , and it should n't be that way the rev calvin o butts 3d , senior minister of abyssinian baptist church in harlem , said , many of us have been arguing about the fact that at this time in the life of africanamericans , we need accountable leadership dr butts , looking ahead to a meeting of the denomination in september , said he would not challenge mr lyons about his personal life but wanted to know more about church finances unless we can get a full , complete audit of all the convention s financial activities , dr butts said , and a complete separation of the personal finances of the president and the convention by an independent auditor , then we need to think about changing leadership influence sapped by internal clashes by rights , the national baptist convention usa would seem to have all the elements of a political and religious force with an estimated eight million members , it is the fourthlargest denomination in the country and is by far the largest predominantly africanamerican religious body it is a loose association of 33 , 000 autonomous churches that together support a religious publishing house , domestic and foreign missionaries , and provide money for several colleges and seminaries as a testament to these numbers , the denomination has been assiduously courted by politicians , including president clinton , who appeared at the convention last fall the church helped jesse jackson s presidential campaign in 1984 , almost propelling him to victory in the democratic caucus in virginia but over the years , its influence has seemed sapped by internal clashes over autocratic leaders and allegations that it was wasting financial resources in 1961 , as the civil rights movement entered an intense phase of struggle against the forces of southern segregation , the denomination was convulsed by an electoral dispute so emotional that fistfights broke out at the annual meeting the rev dr martin luther king jr , the rev gardner c taylor and other young ministers left to found a new organization , the progressive national baptist convention , out of frustration with their inability to oust the denomination s president , the rev j h jackson more recently , in the early 1990 s , as conservatives rallied public sentiment against affirmative action programs , the convention was preoccupied with feuding over some decisions by its president , the rev theodore j jemison he had chosen to build a 12 million headquarters in nashville , to side with mike tyson after the boxer had been charged with rape , and to award the denomination s highest spiritual honor to the boxing promoter don king even though mr lyons is entangled in questions of impropriety now , he ran as a reformer when he was elected to a fiveyear term in 1994 in the campaign , he lambasted the incumbent , mr jemison it s like haiti , mr lyons said we have church government at the papa doc level a laborer s son who knew his destiny a laborer s son who was born in gainesville , fla , mr lyons served as a pastor in georgia in the 1960 s and became pastor of bethel church in st petersburg 25 years ago he has called the convention s presidency his destiny as a student in atlanta at the morehouse school of religion , he told ebony magazine in 1995 , i received my absolute confirmation from god himself that i was to be president
mary ellen conrad had looked at 50 houses in valley stream when she found her dream house it was big it had to sleep 10 , she said it was spacious we needed room to move about , she said in some older homes the halls are so narrow you ca n't pass without bumping into each other and it was reasonably priced cost was definitely an issue , she said the house would make a perfect home , ms conrad decided but not for her ms conrad is director of community residences for the mercy medical center in rockville centre we have residences in wantagh and elmont , she said those two houses are just for the mentally ill this house was to be for the mentally ill and mentally retarded we have a waiting list for the dual disabilities and we thought there would be less of a problem with neighbors , because people are less fearful of retardation than mental illness but the house that was to be a home did not fare well with the surrounding homeowners everybody was opposed , a neighbor , annie rossetti , said all you had to hear was the mentally ill are coming it s that label unfortunately everybody thinks 'oh , they 're crazy they 're going to come into our homes and my children what will happen to my children \? ' everybody was uptight opening group houses has never been easy on the island it s harder to open a home on long island than anywhere else in the state , ms conrad said but in the 90 s we 've had even more resistance perhaps it s the economy people s' major investments are their homes they are concerned that their property values will go down the house in valley stream was a big rambling structure about 100 years old it sat on a corner a few blocks north of merrick road the house had been owned by an old irish family with six kids , ms conrad said the mother s name was rose rose sold the house to mercy in 1993 , and hospital officials notified the village of valley stream of their plan the village had 40 days to accept it , ms conrad said it s the padavan law if they want to turn it down they have to prove that it would alter the character and nature of the community or that the community is already saturated with similar type of housing the village can come up with alternate sites , which they did we would have accepted a site if it was comparable but none matched what we had we could make four single rooms and three doubles in this house it is within walking distance of stores and services it was perfect for our needs neighbors thought otherwise people said , 'we have to do something about this , ' mrs rossetti recalled 'we do n't want this to come into our community our homes are going to devaluate we 're going to have an unsafe neighborhood' it got to be a big thing people were printing up fliers , her nextdoor neighbor , bobbie schneck , added we were having meetings i 've lived here for 21 years we have block parties i would n't move because of my neighbors they 're my friends , and we all did n't want this here , and that was that they were very vocal , ms conrad recalled and they started picketing they picketed in front of the house we owned it , but no one lived there among those picketing were mrs rossetti and mrs schneck and i 'll tell you why , mrs rossetti said i do n't feel good about it now but i picketed because there were these rumors i should have known better but there were rumors that patients with substance abuse and alcohol abuse were going to be in the house i was concerned i only picketed a few times before i found out it was n't true it was a sad time , mrs schneck acknowledged suburban homeowners were picketing a neighbor s house with signs that read , we do n't want the mentally ill in our neighborhood , and , this rose has thorns , referring to the house s former owner rose was being harassed in other ways , too , ms conrad said she would get pizza she did n't order and nuisance phone calls in her old home , windows were being broken and the basement was flooded with our own hose , said ms conrad , who started getting nuisance calls at her house , as well why move into an area where you are not wanted \? there are times when you have to make a decision , ms conrad said are you going to advocate for the needs of a population that ca n't advocate for themselves or are n't you \? if we thought we were putting the community at risk we would n't have chosen this site but in seven years of operating two other sites there has n't been a safety problem fear simmered on both sides of the street neighbors feared the home s residents and how they would act the neighbors wanted to know the names of every resident who would move in , the home s manager , joan jankee , said they wanted to know their backgrounds we could n't give out that information prospective residents feared what would happen if they did move in these people did n't want us , said peter rodriguez , who lives in the home they thought we would hurt them but there has never been a history of residents' hurting neighbors they hired a lawyer , because they hated the idea of us living here
the lockers of several new nets were empty before the sound of the final buzzer had faded friday night , with jim jackson , sam cassell and eric montross among those ready to flee the meadowlands for a twoday break to tie up loose ends in dallas a nets charter flight awaited them perhaps the anticipation of going home to pack their belongings left behind when they became part of the nets' nineplayer trade with dallas on feb 17 disrupted their concentration on the beatable golden state warriors , who eased by the nets , 117108 none of those three former mavericks had a decent night cassell was 5 of 16 , while montross added only 2 points , and jackson scored 8 of his 15 points in the last 3 minutes 20 seconds of a game well out of the nets' reach none of the three was around to explain their performances when the game was over as a group , the focus appeared to be elsewhere they came to play , but we were just slow of foot , said kendall gill , who scored 30 points almost every net looked sluggish as they failed to capture the loose balls , while allowing latrell sprewell \( 37 points \) and joe smith \( 20 points \) to drive undisturbed to the basket perhaps the nets , who were coming off two victories , missed the energy and rebounding edge that jayson williams had provided before his seasonending thumb surgery on monday whatever the reason for the nets' missing motivation , they blew a good opportunity to win three games in a row for the first time all season golden state had been 04 on its nineday trip the only new net who seemed to have his head in the game was chris gatling , who had 17 points off the bench despite an innerear infection that will keep him from traveling with the team the nets play at sacramento on monday that same innerear infection is why gatling was not on the flight to dallas after the game , and perhaps why his focus was more keen he had nowhere to go , unlike jackson , montross and cassell that was disappointing , said coach john calipari , whose team trailed by as many as 21 points in the third quarter when we came back in the fourth , and were down by 9 , the loose balls were right there for us to get and we needed to go get it that s disappointing they understand we did n't guard
who is the real david letterman \? here are some clues from his official video biography alec baldwin , more in sorrow than in anger , reveals dave is , in fact , one of the baldwin brothers when we found out he was going to go into show business , we asked him if he would n't mind performing under a different name mia farrow says in exasperation , for the thousandth time , i want to go on the record , i was never married to david letterman throughout this deadpan spoof , which also features guests as oddly matched as dave s mom and howard stern , mr letterman puts on his goofiest expression , the one that says even if you 're not a baldwin , you might kick him out of your family of course that dunderheaded look works precisely because you know what a sharp comic intelligence is behind it the biography is the centerpiece of tonight s late show with david letterman video special , the third annual primetime collection of taped comic segments from the show mr letterman takes orders at a taco bell drivethrough window could you order a little more food \? he asks a customer i'm one taco supreme away from being employee of the month he interviews cbs job applicants at his request , two do handstands and another belts out a number from guys and dolls none of these routines seem destined to become classics \( well , maybe the stupid human trick in which a woman bulges out her eyeballs until she looks like a creature from a tim burton movie \) but the special is , like late show these days , consistently funny in a lowkey way , and absolutely worth watching mr letterman has been doing some version of this show , on one network or another , for 15 years now it should n't be surprising that a 15yearold show no longer offers groundbreaking humor instead , late show puts a fresh and timely spin on its popular format as much fun as the video special is , it gives a skewed sense of why late show still works it s mr letterman s comic approach that remains appealing his attitude acerbic , absurdist and unpretentious as the situation requires holds the show together in monologues and interviews as well as video segments isolating the videos leaves out plenty of the year s highlights , including his postelection interview with a surprisingly warm and funny bob dole there has been much offscreen hoopla about the fortunes of the letterman show since it moved from nbc to cbs in 1993 each ratings swerve has been accompanied in the press by a different stereotype first mr letterman was a ratings hit but was criticized for becoming kinder , gentler dave when he began losing to jay leno s tonight show , he was portrayed as dave agonistes now he s on the cover of tv guide as stillcool dave in fact , these are exaggerated changes in a longrunning career that is now taking on the heft and continuity of johnny carson s the video special is meant to promote late show , of course as part of the promotional package , mr letterman will appear all evening introducing cbs s regular lineup of sitcoms as he says in his video special monologue , it s all part of cbs s 'put anything on and call it a special monday' what s truly special about late show is that it remains irreverent and funny more nights than not the late show with david letterman video special iii cbs , tonight at 10 rob burnett , executive producer jerry foley , director jon beckerman , supervising producer barbara gaines , producer maria pope , segment producer amy rubin , line producer joe toplyn , producer paul shaffer , musical director joe toplyn , head writer gerard mulligan , steve young , bill scheft , michael barrie , jim mulholland , tim long , rodney rothman , alex gregory , peter huyck , eric kaplan , mark o'keefe , dino stamatopoulos , jon beckerman , rob burnett and david letterman , writers susan hall sheehan , pet and human trick coordinator alan kalter , announcer david letterman , host
cyclospora returns the second outbreak of cyclospora in westchester this spring has sickened at least nine people , causing health officials to advise residents against eating raspberries from guatemala the imported berries have been implicated in more than 100 cases of the parasitic disease nationwide since april the most recent cases in westchester occurred in may , the county s health

percent were 75 to 79 and 18 percent were older than 80 by 2020 , however , 63 percent of that group will be between 60 and 74 13 percent will be between 75 and 79 and 24 percent will be older than 80 in other words , the planning department says , the percentage of very old people is expected to increase the implications are that housing for the elderly with graduated levels of service for different age groups will be in demand in future decades furthermore , the planning department said that for all but the wealthiest households , social security will be the principal source of retirement income savings rates are very low , with at least one study showing that the median level of financial assets of those nearing retirement was 7 , 000 in 1991 , the department said while the increase in value on houses has been substantial for those now benefiting from the inflation of the mid1970 s through the mid80 s , such gains will not be as high at retirement for those who have

on interstate 287 in while plains , said henry miller , the lawyer representing two families affected by the blast the explosion killed the driver of the truck and injured 23 people living within 400 feet the defendants in the case are ryder truck rental , which leased the truck , and paraco gas corporation , which hired the driver mr miller , the former head of the new york state bar association

involving the family of leonard espinal , have been settled out of court jail care criticized the county is faced with at least 19 claims from inmates at the westchester county jail in valhalla that a private contractor has not provided them with adequate health care although the contract with the firm , emsa limited partnership , stipulates that the company is responsible for all costs associated with legal actions , the company has refused to pay the county for those costs county attorney marilyn j slatten has asked the county s board of legislators for permission to sue the company to recover the money when westchester hired emsa in 1995 , the goal was to save money by laying off county workers and turning over health care services at the jail to the private company some elected officials are now questioning whether the decision by county executive andrew p o'rourke , a republican , to privatize those services should be reconsidered this is another example of misguided outsourcing , said county legislator thomas j abinanti , democrat from greenburgh this is what happens when you care more about profit than people we should seriously reconsider rehiring those workers in a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the estate of nancy blumenthal , a bedford teenager who committed suicide in the county jail in valhalla on may 17 , last year , emsa will be paying 750 , 000 , and westchester will be paying 700 , 000 , pending approval of the board of legislators the 17yearold girl s parents , wendy and lawrence blumenthal , charged in federal district court for the

washington , april 25 three helicopters of the type that crashed in manhattan last week , killing a passenger , had earlier been found to have cracks in their tails , the same flaw blamed in the accident but the federal aviation administration said it had not learned of those cracks until after last week s crash the faa today ordered the grounding of all 132 helicopters in the united states of that model , the germanmade bk117 , so mechanics could check for cracks in the tail any helicopters found to have cracks will be grounded indefinitely , the faa said , because there is no approved repair procedure on april 15 , a helicopter owned by colgatepalmolive crashed into the east river just after taking off from the 60th street heliport in manhattan the company s chief technology officer , craig b tate , 51 , was killed another passenger and one of the two pilots were seriously injured investigators said the tail broke off the faa said a crack began in a ushaped rib in the tail and gradually spread until only the outer skin was carrying the flight load then , the agency said , it spread until catastrophic overstress occurred this condition , if not corrected , could result in failure of the vertical fin and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter , the agency said the helicopter was a bk117 , manufactured by eurocopter deutschland , a german company faa officials said today that three helicopters of that model had previously had cracks in the tail , though none had resulted in accidents the faa said the earlier cracks had been repaired by the manufacturer , but timothy ruddick , a spokesman for eurocopter s american office in grand prairie , tex , said his company had not done the repair work he said the cracks could have been repaired on a casebycase basis under authorizations by engineers designated by the faa larry m kelly , acting manager of the faa s rotocraft directorate , said one question is how the earlier ones did n't make it into the system any such operating problems are supposed to be reported to the faa and entered into its databases mr kelly said the cracks were caused by metal fatigue , meaning that the metal had been bent too often or too severely or both the probable reason is a design flaw , he said in a telephone interview from his office in fort worth the agency has been repeatedly criticized in recent years by congressional auditors and others for gaps in data collection it was not clear , however , if knowing about the three earlier incidents of cracking would have led the faa to order prompt inspections of all such helicopters in the country checking for the crack requires partial disassembly of the helicopter , and the agency estimated that it would take a mechanic four hours to conduct the faa ordered that inspections of the bk117 be made at least once every 100 hours of flying time , an unusually short interval for inspections since we do n't have any crack growth numbers , we felt it was prudent to put that inspection at 100 hours , mr kelly said about onethird of the 132 such helicopters registered in the country have already been inspected today , mr kelly said , and cracks were discovered in one the manufacturer of the helicopter issued a bulletin to its customers today to check for cracks , the faa said the spot where the crack began supports the tail rotor it can be inspected visually , with no more than a flashlight , but doing so requires removing several components this is not a difficult inspection as compared to others that could have been required , mr kelly said he said that helicopters with cracks would be grounded until the company comes up with an faaapproved repair procedure that could happen as early as next week , he said the typical fix is a reinforcement or doubler , he said the bk117 helicopter is one of the most popular models for emergency medical services , because its size allows for easy maneuverability in tight spaces and the design of its back doors permits stretchers to be rapidly moved on and off with minimum maneuvering rocky mountain helicopters , one of the largest owners with 30 bk117 s in its fleet of 65 helicopters nationwide , said one was taken out of service today in charleston , wva , because a crack of the size described by the faa inspection order had been found in its tail i do n't think it will have a severe effect on ems missions anywhere , said john m heiskell , the vice president for contract management at rocky mountain helicopters , whose headquarters are in provo , utah some operators said they had yet to hear from the manufacturer or the faa that an inspection was required andy faletto , director of aviation services for hermann hospital in houston , said its three helicopters were still in use and normal inspections had not turned up any problems , but he said he did not know anything about the check required by today s faa order those familiar with the model , which can cost from 1 million or more for a used model to 4 million for a new one , said they doubted the cracks were widespread i would be surprised if they found more than a few , said frank jensen

when stew leonard jr decided last year to build a 25 million dairy store and plant on a 50acre parcel of land in orange , population 12 , 500 , he expected some opposition it is , after all a town that not so long ago was mostly farmland and that fears overdevelopment but mr leonard said he never expected his proposal for a 135 , 000squarefoot dairy store , petting zoo and manufacturing plant at exit 41 of the connecticut turnpike to divide the town so bitterly that even lifelong residents say they do n't remember a more tumultuous issue and no one in town can recall a public hearing process drawing such crowds several times during the course of seven hearings , more than 1 , 200 people showed up at a meeting and hundreds of them spoke , pro and con no , i 've never seen anything like this , not even close , said philip nizardo jr , a republican and chairman of the town plan and zoning commission , which must render a final decision on the store proposal during all my years in the town and on the zoning board i do n't think we 've ever had more than 100 people to a hearing , and that was the total for three or four applications at the first public hearing , on rezoning the land now allowed only light industrial use , more than 1 , 200 people attended we were expecting 200 or 300 people , said mr nizardo i found out literally what they mean by wall to wall people the first hearing on the proposal , which was held in early january , had to be postponed because the community center where it was scheduled only holds about 600 people the rescheduled hearing , held the following week , was conducted at the 12 , 000seat amity regional junior high school auditorium , the site of several followup hearings and when the public hearing process concluded last week it was only after highly charged arguments about traffic congestion and safety versus the advantages of finally putting the longvacant parcel to use , thus expanding the town s tax base both opponents and supporters flaunted tshirts and buttons , waved signs and carried placards many had to be told to stop heckling one of the more popular slogans worn by opponents was we have real cows , we do n't need fakes , alluding to the trademark stew leonard costumed characters supporters countered with two out of three support stew s , why not you \? alluding to prehearing poll results at the final hearing , some opponents even derided and heckled mr leonard when he announced plans to donate 25 acres of the parcel to the town and construct and name buildings there in memory of his late son , stewart leonard 3d , who drowned in a 1989 pool accident there are certain basic standards of decency that we as a community should observe and that was n't done at that hearing , said a proposal supporter , richard slawsky mr slawsky , a republican and board of finance vice chairman , contends that political pressure has been exerted by some members of his own party to pressure the board to reject the plan he and other supporters say the real target is first selectman robert sousa , a strong supporter of the plan and the first democrat elected as first selectman in more than 170 years mr sousa is up for reelection in november there is n't any question in my mind that this has been used as a political issue against me , and that s one of the reasons this has become such an incredibly divisive issue in town , said mr sousa , whose proposal for a nonbinding townwide referendum on the plan was defeated in a 33 board of selectmen vote the republican town committee chairman , william t musco , also a member of the board of selectmen , strongly denied that his party had turned the proposal into a political issue if anyone has done that , it s the first selectman who has aspirations to run for the state senate , said mr musco but do i think his supporting this will hurt him in november \? yes , i do mr sousa points to a poll conducted by global strategy group , a research firm in new york that surveyed 300 town residents and found that 7 out of 10 orange residents either favored or were not opposed to the proposal the main reason i support the project so strongly , mr sousa said , is that the marsh hill road parcel of land has been vacant since the turnpike was built in the 1950 s , and i believe this type of dairy farm store would be a perfect fit for orange and a good way to expand our tax base but opponents point out that global strategy was hired by stew leonard and say the sampling of 300 was not broad enough they want the land which 10 years ago was at the heart of another heated battle when a proposal for a regional mall was defeated used for an office park or some other light industrial use they point out that 13 million people a year visit mr leonard s two other stores in norwalk and danbury and that stew leonard is listed in ripley s believe it or not as attracting more people than the ringling brothers and barnum bailey circus
new orleans , jan 19 super bowl xxxi , like all football games , will be decided by the results of dozens of playerversusplayer and positionversusposition matchups and of all the showdowns in this year s game , none is expected to be more important than patriots running back curtis martin versus the green bay packer linebackers the packers' defense , which yielded just 885 yards rushing a game during the regular season , is tough against the run because of his quickness , martin , who rushed for 1 , 152 yards and 14 touchdowns this season , is dangerous around the line of scrimmage if he gets past the packers' linebackers , his ability to accelerate in the open field can spell trouble for the green bay defense i do n't want to see him in the secondary , packers safety leroy butler said that would n't be good pittsburgh can attest to that two weeks ago in the patriots' divisional playoff victory over the steelers , martin was in pittsburgh s secondary so much , he could have been auditioning for safety in the regular season , he snapped off 7 runs of 20 yards or longer \( including bursts of 81 , 56 and 33 yards \) martin , the national football league offensive rookie of the year last season , also caught 46 passes for 333 yards that is 72 yards a reception the packers' defensive coordinator , fritz shurmur , said martin s skills compare to those of dallas s emmitt smith and detroit s barry sanders , but because of new england s tendencies , the preparation for him must be somewhat different he s a great cutback runner , shurmur said he catches the ball out of the backfield he does it all they have a way to be able to open their formations up and force you to defend the whole field , and that can cause problems with a cutback runner with cutback runners , the offensiveline blocking flows in one direction , drawing the defensive pursuit the running back follows that blocking and then cuts back against the flow and find gaps in the defense a good cutback runner is dangerous in certain situations you have to stay back and wait and see whether the cutback is going to occur , packers linebacker wayne simmons said on the other hand , we 'll go in and force the issue simmons said the packers have not faced a back quite like martin this season without the power , he s like emmitt smith , simmons said the packers have faced some very good running backs this season , including smith , sanders , philadelphia s ricky watters and denver s terrell davis but one running back who gave them a great deal of trouble this season was greg hill of kansas city , who rushed for 129 yards and 2 touchdowns he is a quick runner whose slashing style left the packers' defenders grabbing air because martin is so quick near the line of scrimmage and has the ability to make people miss , he needs only a small seam and he can be gone his offensive linemen do not have to sustain their blocks for long he s definitely a guy who has to be reckoned with , packers defensive end sean jones said he s one of those guys , if you have a good line already , it becomes a great line , an overwhelming line , because he makes them that much better packers safety eugene robinson said the patriots have lately shifted the emphasis of their offense away from trying to attack primarily with their speedy receivers , terry glenn and shawn jefferson and tight end ben coates now that they 've gotten to the playoffs , you have glenn with eight catches , jefferson with eight catches and coates with a whopping four catches , which is uncharacteristic , robinson said that shows that things have shifted to a true running game that sets up the pass and they have two bigplay receivers on the outside that can get it done pound you , pound you , pound you , playaction the packers faced a hot running back , carolina s anthony johnson , in the national football conference championship game the week before , johnson had pummeled the cowboys' defense , which was weakened considerably without defensive tackle leon lett still , the cowboys had a formidable defense and what johnson accomplished was eyeopening the packers took it all in and then stopped johnson cold he managed just 31 yards rushing and the panthers' offense was dead in the water green bay defensive players are not boasting about what they are going to do against martin , which could mean trouble for the patriots it s not all about showing , simmons said if you want to play show and tell , we 've already accomplished what we 've done this season we just want to win the super bowl we 're the no 1 defense it does n't matter by stopping the run , it s just another task

oklahoma city , june 7 every day , people walk the chainlink fence and browse the notes and toys and trinkets hung there , heartbreak woven into wire they circle the vacant space where the alfred p murrah federal building stood , and they try to decipher the prayers and sentiments that the rains have turned to a blur there was a toy elvis , a hubcap and a bouquet of yellow plastic roses there was a small wooden cross blessed by pope john paul ii , and a business card from edward g schmidgall , moose lodge no 1571 , farmington , ill there were 425 stuffed animals and a picture of a child who died here i have been here for two days , and walked around the fence 20 times , one visitor wrote on a scrap of white cloth tied to the fence it never hurts any less the people who live here know that feeling , of great sadness circling around and around itself , all too well once , before the morning of april 19 , 1995 , oklahoma city was known as the home of the cowboy museum , as a place to find oil and eat steaks the blast changed its identity just as a sniper s bullets did dallas , but here the victims were friends and neighbors , crushed , blown apart it became a city of victims now that timothy j mcveigh has been held accountable for the bombing of the federal building , which took 168 lives , people who were not hurt directly by the bomb , and a few who were , say it may finally be appropriate for the city to turn loose of its collective sadness , if it can the city s firefighters , among the first to enter the nightmare of the shattered building , can now talk about the bombing in past tense , said kenneth bunch , the assistant fire chief but the scale of death and destruction was so great that it seems to reach everywhere a methodist minister compared the bombing to rape , and like a rape , said others here , recovery will be complicated , tenuous , uneven there has never been a hurt this deep in an american city at the hands of terrorists it goes well beyond the some 900 people who were injured , said those who have lived through it it is impossible to walk into a business , stroll a sidewalk , even fly on a plane in and out of oklahoma city and not brush up against the sadness julie smith and her husband , pat , own and operate the goodyear tire store downtown , near the bombed property they were not hurt but early on the morning of april 19 , a man brought his car in to be worked on and asked for a ride to his job one of their workers drove him there , to the federal building that man died in the rubble it is a link , however insignificant , between the smith family and the families of those who suffered the day of mr mcveigh s conviction , julie smith brought her five daughters to the chainlink fence around that vacant lot , because she believed she had to i just think it s important for my kids to remember this , mrs smith said it is as if , by sharing in the misery that befell their neighbors , the pain was spread a little thinner the sadness even insinuated itself into wedding albums dedra hayes , 23 , and her husband , chad , 22 , got married just two weeks after the bombing only 35 people came to our wedding , she said , because of course we could n't send out all the invitations but it was a really nice wedding she was on the second floor of the nearby journal record building , working as a temporary accountant for the state i faced the blast , she said , and the concussion injured her eyes she has to wear glasses now no one talks about forgetting no one wants to forget they just want to stop hurting it s similar to being in a war , said the rev j harold thompson , the pastor of carter park baptist church i do n't know anyone who has put this behind them time lets you get on with your life , he added , but that cannot happen as long as the courts resurrect those awful memories even if the federal jury in denver decides that mr mcveigh should die , there is still the trial of his alleged coconspirator , terry l nichols even after that , the chief prosecutor in oklahoma city wants to try mr mcveigh here on state charges once all those trials and punishments are decided , it may take 5 years , maybe even as long as 10 , before anything close to widespread recovery will be a fact of life here , mr thompson and others said the rev rick marion , the pastor of capitol hill united methodist church , said his congregation was mostly spared , but the blast still caused distress that resurfaced , strongly , with the trial , he said the city is healing , he said people are able to function but that process will be slow people are still working through their anger , and some people are even still working on acceptance people feel like we 've been raped in oklahoma city , you do n't expect to be blown up some thought it would be best to erect a modest memorial and build another highrise on the building site , to start fresh , but that would have been like building in the middle of a cemetery for most people here the site will be enshrined with a large permanent memorial , and the journal record building , also wrecked , is to be renovated and turned into a museum , gov frank keating said we will always have a sad memory in our past , lieut gov mary fallin said the guilty verdict will help close a chapter in the book of this recovery few people here would ever dare say that the grieving has lasted too long , certainly not to people who lost someone in the bombing , or who were maimed in it if you can come up with a life that does n't revolve around it , it s better , said martin cash , who lost an eye but that is asking too much , for now if i ever saw any of these people or their relatives on the street , he said of the people linked to the setting of the bomb , i 'd kill them with my bare hands the truth , people here say , is that there may not be any such thing as collective healing , as recovery of a city that will come house by house i have my life to deal with it , said bud welch , 57 , who lost his daughter , julie marie , 23 what happens to mr mcveigh now will not affect that , he said mr welch runs a gas station , but lately , he said , i 've been doing some farming , been plowing fields there may not be peace in it , maybe just distraction , but he likes how he feels doing it tina tomlin s life , in many ways , stopped after her husband , rick , was killed in the blast i'm still not cooking , my house is atrocious you should see my bedroom , she said it kills me , that i do n't care but i have no reason to i kept it all up for rick why bother now \? but she knows that is giving up , giving in to mr mcveigh and those others who took part in the bombing i ca n't let mcveigh ruin my life the way he ruined rick s , mrs tomlin said i ca n't let him take my life she just has to figure out how to stop it recently , she dyed her hair at least , it was a change richard williams is the buildings manager for federal offices here , and he was in the federal building when the bomb went off a rescue worker found him , took his pulse and found none , and left him for dead but later , he was told , another rescuer heard him moaning and carried him out his right hand was smashed and his right ear was left hanging by cartilage , among other injuries after months of physical therapy , he can pitch again for his traveling softball team of players older than 50 , the classics he will dedicate the rest of his life to the building and keeping of the memorial to honor those who died and those who suffered , but he will also make sure he keeps living before this i would n't have taken time to go to a concert or a ball game , mr williams said , but now i realize it can all be over in a blink of an eye to many people , the chainlink fence is the memorial to the oklahoma city bombing diann cunningham , a receptionist at first american title and trust , three blocks north of the bomb site , drives past here on her way home from work rain , snow , wind , she said , there is always someone here someone from magic city sewer and drain of nashville wrote , we have come a long way to see and remember , but i never imagined i would feel so close the writer s name is not legible there was one tshirt signed by the grambling state university track team , another from boy scout troop 1988 in houston the visitors come from across the nation , or just across town the picture of the dead baby , part of a homemade memorial , is signed i love you the most , always , mama photo the chainlink fence at the site of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city has attracted a daily stream of visitors in the two years since the building was destroyed by a bomb many have left mementos or memorials on the fence , while others have just paused to remember the victims \( photographs by michelle v agins the new york times \)
los angeles , jan 9 the two bids for the military businesses of the hughes electronics corporation are likely to come to perhaps 10 billion , but will hinge less on their face value than tax considerations and estimates of the future value of the stock of the winning company , people close to the situation said today the raytheon company and the northrop grumman corporation both submitted bid packages that came to nearly 500 pages each , these people said , and the general motors corporation , hughes s parent , is expected to choose a winner as early as next week , though perhaps sooner both bidders are in negotiations with general motors , which could result in an increase in the value of the bids to 10 billion and other changes in the terms it appeared initially that northrop grumman s bid might be slightly higher on its face , these people said , but it was far from clear what the longer term value of each offer came to the aim of the offers is to both present the highest longterm value to hughes s shareholders , who would be receiving perhaps 5 billion or more of the stock of the winning company , and a deal that avoids taxes those tax considerations are why , people close to the situation said , each of the offers is likely to result in the winner having to create a new class of stock as payment to the old hughes shareholders guesses on how those shares would be valued by the market in the future , rather than now , are thus critical to determining which bid is more attractive , people with knowledge of the process said none of the companies involved would comment but the acquisition of hughes s military and aerospace businesses , which produces missiles , airborne radar systems and specialized optical devices and had roughly 6 billion in revenues last year , would be critical for the future of raytheon and northrop grumman , making the competition heated there has been a steady consolidation in the weapons industry over the last four years , in response to steep declines in the pentagon s weapons procurement budgets and an easing of the antitrust rules on such deals by the clinton administration those changes have resulted in the emergence of two weapons behemoths , the lockheed martin corporation and the boeing company , which just agreed to pay 133 billion for the mcdonnell douglas corporation the mergers have put enormous pressure on the remaining military contractors to find partners so they can compete raytheon agreed last week to pay approximately 3 billion for the military businesses of texas instruments the last remaining large company on the block is the military arm of hughes electronics analysts have speculated that the loser in the bidding may have to put itself up for sale , or that raytheon and northrop grumman might ultimately end up having to merge to remain competitive with the two other giants all those considerations have made this one of the most complex takeover deals in years huge numbers of tax lawyers and investment bankers have been hired to structure the packages ultimately , hughes electronics is expected to borrow from 3 billion to 5 billion before the deal closes , and pay that money to its shareholders or perhaps leave some with what remains of hughes electronics , a big satellite business the winning bidder would then assume that debt burden , and pay more than perhaps 5 billion or 6 billion in newly issued shares the deals would thus result in great stress being placed on the winning bidder to cut costs sharply and create other efficiencies , which is likely to mean large layoffs and many plant shutdowns
the opening of ansonia last year set off great expectations on the upper west side it looked as if the neighborhood , which is often called a restaurant wasteland , might finally support an ambitious restaurant this year s opening of jean georges , a bit to the south , was cause for rejoicing a great chef had finally ventured west recently the area even got its own greenmarket but for the most part , little has changed just take a look at ocean grill the fish house , a sibling of blue water grill on union square , started out on a high note when it opened in april my first meal in the large , handsome space was impressive excellent asian shrimp dumplings were followed by a perfectly steamed lobster served with bright green steamed broccoli the tuna was an admirably thick slab , and the waiter stood watching as i made the first cut seeing the bright red interior , he asked , you 'd like that cooked a little more \? even the fishloather was well served , with a plump piece of chicken cooked so the skin was crisp , the meat moist the mound of garlic mashed potatoes on the side was fluffy and fine it was all so good that i thought maybe the restaurant would turn into one of those wonderful american institutions where simple food is cooked with great authority but then the crowds began to roll in ocean grill is serving just the sort of food people are eager to eat in hot weather raw clams and oysters , salads and simply grilled fish many of the appetizers have an appealing asian accent , and much of the menu reads like a hit parade of favorite new york dishes crab cakes , shrimp cocktail and fried calamari faced with instant popularity , the kitchen settled into a slump i have had five meals at ocean grill in hopes that it would turn into another upper west side star but that has not happened everything is adequate but nothing is great the last dinner i had at the restaurant began with clams and oysters on the half shell once you got past the flowery flavor descriptions , which sound like the worst sort of winespeak \( when was the last time you had an oyster that tasted like a cucumber \? \) , they were just fine but the shrimp in the cocktail , while plump and nicely cooked , were almost devoid of shrimp flavor all i could taste was iodine this is not an indication that anything is wrong with the shrimp certain shrimp eat a diet that makes them naturally taste like iodine , but they are , to my mind , less desirable and a sign of inattention in the kitchen other signs soon followed the steamed lobster was impeccably cooked but not hot , as if it had sat waiting in the kitchen for the rest of the order to be ready the shrimp dumplings , tender and delicate on an earlier occasion , were now tough and the summer rolls , a variation on a vietnamese theme , were light , pretty and bland the grilled fish i tried were all nicely handled , and the french fries were excellent fried calamari from point judith \( in rhode island \) were hot and crisp i liked the crab cakes , too although they were made with shredded crab instead of respectable lumps of crab meat , they were crisp and plump and served with a fine roasted corn salsa i was less impressed with the special of the evening , a smoked trout hash with potatoes fried into a cake the waiter described it as a fish knish , which was , i suppose , as good a description as any for the smoky , little fish disk and the chicken , as always , was good but a couple of dishes were inexcusable linguine arrived stuck together in clumps the shrimp , green and yellow squash and cherry tomatoes could not rescue the dish , which was hard and crusty on the top and the filet mignon , ordered medium rare , was even worse than steak has a right to be in a fish house it was a tough piece of meat , and it was entirely well done desserts were big , sweet and reasonably priced the sundae , an intense combination of brownies , hot fudge and ice cream , would make any child happy , and the caramelized figs with ice cream were easily enough to please two grownups no one could ever accuse ocean grill of stinting lunch is an even better bargain the 1495 prix fixe special offers a minioyster tasting as an appetizer , followed by a choice of entrees and dessert those who care to can sit outside in the cafe the service in the quiet of the afternoon is lovely cold poached salmon is very pleasant , and even the hamburger is good but beware of the salads , pretty things that have been assembled for the eye and not the mouth the lobster salad offers a beautiful swirl of lettuce , a few tomatoes , hearts of palm , roasted corn , a lobster claw looking down at that frilly plate , i found myself longing for a classic american seafood salad as i tried to figure out how to attack the plate with my fork , it occurred to me that ocean grill was a nice addition to the neighborhood , but someday , if we 're really lucky , the upper west side will have a straightforward , reasonably priced american restaurant that concentrates on quality ocean grill \( rating one star \) 384 columbus avenue , near 78th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 5792300 atmosphere the room is big and attractively understated , with a raw bar in the front and a boisterous clientele service everybody is young , friendly , attractive and eager to please sound level loud recommended dishes raw clams and oysters , fried calamari , crab cakes , steamed clams , grilled tuna , grilled swordfish , grilled salmon , chicken with mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes , hamburger , brownie sundae wine list decent and fairly priced hours lunch 11 30 am to 4 pm mondays through saturdays , 10 30 am to 4 pm sundays dinner 5 pm to midnight mondays through thursdays , until 1 am fridays and saturdays price range lunch appetizers 450 to 950 , main courses 850 to 1895 , threecourse prix fixe at 1495 dinner appetizers 550 to 950 , main courses 1050 to 1995 , lobsters 1675 a pound desserts 550 to 595 brunch 995 to 1695 credit cards american express , mastercard and visa wheelchair accessibility many steps up to dining room restrooms are down a flight of stairs what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction primarily to food , with ambiance and service taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change past reviews hundreds of times restaurant reviews are available on line from times , an arts and entertainment guide on america online software and information 18005485201 photo ocean grill \( carol halebian for the new york times \)
atlanta , march 14 less than 24 hours after releasing images of nine people wanted for questioning in last summer s bombing at centennial olympic park , the federal bureau of investigation said today that it had located seven of the nine none of the seven are considered suspects , said jay spadafore , a spokesman for the fbi we consider these people as people who might be in a position to provide useful information to us , he said we 've made contact with all of them some have been interviewed , and we 've arranged to interview the others we 've gotten some useful information from them , but i ca n't elaborate mr spadafore said that some of the seven people had called the fbi themselves after seeing their pictures on television and that the bureau had been directed to the others by acquaintances on thursday , fbi officials held a news conference in atlanta to release the photographs some of the people pictured in the images two photographs , two videotape frames and one sketch were near the part of the park where the bomb was planted at the approximate time that the investigators believe it was placed there others seem to be carrying backpacks similar to the one that contained the bomb the bomb exploded at 1 20 am on july 27 during a heavily attended concert in the park , killing one woman and injuring 111 people the fbi has not made an arrest in the case or in other bombings in the atlanta area this year , at a lesbian nightclub and at a building housing an abortion clinic mr spadafore said the bureau was still searching for a man with a goatee depicted in an artist s sketch and for a man pictured in a fuzzy photograph carrying a backpack and wearing a long coat he said the sketch had generated several telephone calls but acknowledged that the person in the grainy photograph would be difficult to identify he s going to have to identify himself , mr spadafore said
fort lauderdale , fla , march 1 for 15 minutes , cal ripken takes ground balls to his glove side last season , ripken was removed for a pinchrunner in the eighth inning of a onerun game , marking the first time in the major leagues that he had been taken out with the outcome undecided for 15 minutes , cal ripken takes ground balls backhanded last season , ripken was temporarily moved to third base , ending his major league record string of 2 , 216 games at shortstop for 10 minutes , cal ripken fields bunts last season , ripken was joined in clubhouse controversy by bobby bonilla , whose words spoke louder than his bat when he blamed his poor early performance on his position as designated hitter , and by the nonetoopeaceful coexistence of mike mussina , the no 1 pitcher , and pat dobson , the pitching coach bonilla and dobson are no longer with the baltimore orioles ripken , after 15 years , is no longer the orioles' shortstop this spring , he is taking all of those grounders and bunts at third base mike bordick is the shortstop he was one of three frontline players \( outfielder eric davis and pitcher jimmy key are the others \) the orioles added in the off season to fortify themselves for a summer duel with the yankees besides finding out if they can rid themselves of their runnerup status , the orioles must learn if they have shed their status as a dysfunctional family there was a running battle of comments in the press , somewhat goodnatured , but nonetheless with an edge to it , peter angelos , the orioles' owner , said recently , discussing the dispute between bonilla and manager davey johnson i do n't think the team leveled off and started playing together until bobby was in right field and a lot of the conflict between the two had subsided i know bonilla gets more of the blame , but i beg to differ i think most of the provocation was coming from the other direction that s because davey is a combative guy he does n't back off i find bonilla to be a good team player and a good personality i heard that was n't the case in new york , but in baltimore you could n't ask for a better guy pat gillick , the general manager , offered a different view of bonilla , now a member of the florida marlins adding those three guys and moving those other two guys off the club will be a plus , gillick said , referring to bonilla and david wells , the pitcher now with the yankees not that i do n't like wells or i do n't like bobby , but there s a little more businesslike approach to what key and bordick do the way they go about their business is more serious and determined bobby and david are good guys , but they 've kind of got their own style it does n't necessarily upset anybody , but it bothers them it s more of an irritant johnson himself was an irritant to angelos and , angelos believed , to some of the players the owner , in fact , was viewed as having created an impression after last season that he no longer wanted johnson as the orioles' manager but angelos said that impression was exaggerated i had some concerns about certain critical comments being made publicly about one player or another , angelos said by telephone from baltimore i think if there s going to be criticism of a player or coworker or cohort , that s best done privately we all sometimes slip and say things we should n't say , but this was happening frequently davey says he does it because he thinks it enhances performance i do n't agree with it back then , there were negative comments made about chris hoiles , mussina , bonilla , all of which i found to be totally without basis i thought no constructive purpose was being served johnson , who during the off season talked out the owner s differences with him , thought there was i do n't rip players , johnson said , pausing from his preparations for the next day s exhibition game sometimes you say he s better than that or he s capable of being better than that that s not a rip that s a roundabout way of saying he s not doing the things he s capable of doing guess who s at third \? they call him the streak can the orioles' hierarchy agree on anything \? well , ripken as the third baseman , for at least one thing they all believe he will be a good one and that the switch will make the orioles a stronger team but because the move involves ripken , the only man who outlasts the energizer bunny , the orioles will once again be scrutinized for daily dysfunctional developments johnson tried to make the move last year , ending ripken s shortstop streak at 2 , 216 consecutive games the player who pushed ripken to third base was manny alexander johnson had used him earlier in the season as an eighthinning pinchrunner for ripken in a close game against the yankees ripken telegraphed his displeasure with the former move by refusing to comment about it after the 15inning loss for six successive games in midjuly , ripken played third , and alexander , a young , unestablished dominican , played short the experiment failed alexander committed more errors \( two \) than he had hits \( one \) , and he struck out 9 times in 18 atbats he did it all without a word or any other kind of encouragement from ripken he resented it , a member of the orioles said of ripken all of his friends resented it except for the latin guys and the coaches , no one gave manny the time of day ripken , however , said the perception of his reaction was wrong
only one nominee on tape this year s oscar nominations have n't given home video much to work with frequently , several of the biggest films are already on tape when the nominations are announced in february this time there is one fargo , the coen brothers' ode to minnesota winters , which was nominated for best picture and six other awards the only other bestpicture nominee with firm video prospects is secrets and lies , which is to be released by fox on april 15 other bestpicture nominees , jerry mcguire and the english patient , will be along in due course , but even then this year s field suffers from what might be called boxoffice gap video thrives on big moneymakers , which are in scarce supply among oscar nominees this year from jerry mcguire , the only megahit in the field , with about 123 million in theater revenue , there is an almost 80 million drop to the next film , the english patient , with about 44 million in fact , if secrets and lies were to win right now , it would have a relatively paltry 8 million at the box office but independent films like fargo \( 24 million in theaters \) and shine \( 17 million \) , the other bestpicture nominee , are often particularly welcome on home video because they have n't been widely seen in theaters several films with moderately good reviews are coming out this month , although none were nominated for oscars on tuesday , new line will release normal people , directed by john mcnaughton and starring ashley judd as a disturbed young woman who helps her husband \( luke perry \) rob banks in an unusual routing , mr mcnaughton s film was shown on hbo before making the trip from theater to video store in the very fast time of just under four months other recommended small independent films just out on tape include matthew broderick s infinity , about a physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb the big squeeze , an uneven but entertaining comedy about a woman \( lara flynn boyle \) out to con her husband , and girls town , jim mckay s provocative film starring lili taylor as a toughtalking daredevil in a clique of high school girls sound of no hands washing for something more soothing , consider the gently reflective and beautifully realized family portraits of yasujiro ozu , one of japan s greatest film makers last week , home vision reissued good morning \( 1959 \) , about the problems that erupt when a father refuses to buy a television set , and early summer \( 1951 \) , about a young woman torn between single life and an arranged marriage if you doubt the nuances possible when a little boy is told to wash his hands before dinner but does n't , try early summer the price is 2995 each keep in mind when tuesday weld was no longer the ingenue a screen ingenue who was later recognized for her talent , tuesday weld plays the mother of vincent d'onofrio and keanu reeves in feeling minnesota , released feb 11 on videocassette here are some of her other films on tape who 'll stop the rain \? ms weld stars with nick nolte and michael moriarty in karel reisz s film , adapted from robert stone s dog soldiers , about a vietnam veteran who tries heroin smuggling 1978 mgm ua 1495 126 minutes r serial as a neurotic mother , ms weld drives her daughter into a cult in bill persky s film , based on cyra mcfadden s riotous book about the struggle to stay hip in marin county 1980 paramount 4999 91 minutes r , thief in michael mann s film , a diamond thief \( james caan \) trying to avoid the mob has a wife \( ms weld \) with mob connections 1981 mgm ua 1495 123 minutes r once upon a time in america ms weld is a housewife and parttime prostitute in sergio leone s film about brooklyn thugs \( robert de niro and james woods \) in the 1920 s warner1984 2995 226 minutes closed captioned r heartbreak hotel 1988 a teenager \( david keith \) tries to cheer up his dissipated mother \( ms weld \) by kidnapping elvis presley 1988 touchstone 1995 100 minutes closed captioned pg13 falling down as a man wronged , or so he feels , michael douglas goes on a rampage and ms weld is the needy wife of a detective \( robert duvall \) in joel schumacher s film 1993 warner 1495 112 minutes closed captioned r
fort worth , june 3 strange things began happening the moment the van cliburn international piano competition moved from the preliminaries into the semifinal round on thursday this second of the competition s three phases opened with the startling news that one of the 12 semifinalists , stanislav yudenich , had withdrawn after an early morning accident with a teapot left him with seconddegree burns on his left hand during the preliminaries , mr yudenich , a 25yearold pianist from uzbekistan , had become a favorite with a recital that included a delicate , probing account of a mozart sonata amid tests of virtuosity and coloristic acumen by liszt and stravinsky yet more than a few skeptics quoted freud s opinion that there are no accidents mr yudenich himself seemed more relieved than depressed as he attended his fellow competitors' performances , his hand swathed in bandages the prevalent theory among the armchair psychologists in the audience was that mr yudenich might have felt unprepared for the pressure of the later rounds if so , the performances by several of the other semifinalists suggested that he was not alone during the preliminaries , most of the 35 performers played with such assurance and polish that the jurors deliberated late into the night to pare the list of potential semifinalists to 12 when the jurors met on monday evening to select six pianists to move on to the finals , they had a different problem by midday , only three players seemed to have the votes to move forward what i'm continually looking for , said warren jones , a pianist and one of the 14 jurors , is someone who plays better in the second round than in the first a test of the ability to sustain a career , after all , is whether a musician can come back time after time it takes a certain maturity people often look first at how well the fingers work , how well the soul works but this competition looks at mental stamina as well as physical yet throughout the semifinals , listeners who had kept tabs on the proceedings wondered why even their favorites from the first round suddenly sounded so nervous and tentative daring was replaced in some cases by cautiousness , in others by outright eccentricity the wideranging and sometimes defiantly noncompetitionlike programming of the preliminaries gave way to predictable recitals , with blockbusters and romantic roofraisers more plentiful than they had been the semifinals were in two parts each player offered a 75minute solo program , the only prescribed repertory being a work commissioned for the competition , william bolcom s nine bagatelles , a virtuosic rollercoaster of a work the piece elicited an extraordinary variety of readings several pianists ignored dynamic and expressive markings , others radically redefined the tempos and a couple seemed to be making up sections that were not quite under their fingers mr bolcom , however , was diplomatically generous yes , he ignored some of the instructions in english , he said of one russian player , but i thought he brought a lot to it each pianist also played a chamber work \( the choices were the schumann , brahms , dvorak and franck quintets none chose the franck \) with the tokyo string quartet the fact that the chamber component involved 11 pianists playing three works undercut slightly the cliburn administration s notion of recasting this competition as a festival no festival administrator would have an audience sit through the schumann quintet three times in a day the biggest shock of the chamber round , though , was the poor sound of the tokyo quartet much of that could be attributed to a recent personnel change the group is breaking in a new first violinist who comes from an entirely different stylistic world , and they have not yet found common ground but a listener had to sympathize with the pianists forced to perform , on only one rehearsal , with an ensemble that was hardly unified within itself all this left some of the jurors wondering , early in the round , whether they could in good conscience choose six finalists , but when it came down to a vote , the deliberations on monday lasted just over an hour and produced a varied slate those who advanced were jon nakamatsu , a 28yearold american , and jan gottlieb jiracek , 24 , from germany , both of whom played with dazzling inventiveness in both rounds aviram reichert , 25 , from israel , and filippo gamba , 28 , from italy , the two most consistently elegant players in the competition katya skanavy , 25 , and yakov kasman , 30 , both firebrands from russia for the finals , the competition will move from the 1 , 200seat ed landreth auditorium of texas christian university to the 3 , 054seat tarrant county convention center theater starting thursday evening , the six remaining pianists will perform concertos with the fort worth symphony orchestra and the fort worth chamber orchestra , conducted by james conlon on sunday evening , the winners of the gold , silver and bronze medals will be announced this time the jurors' task may grow even more difficult , because the cliburn s rules prohibit withholding any of the prizes or declaring a tie richard rodzinski , the executive director of the competition , described this as a practical policy , explaining what it means is that during these three weeks , these jurors preferred this pianist over the others at this level , after all , technique is not an issue anyone who has gotten this far has the technique so the objective side is taken care of we 're looking at the subjective
hong kong , march 22 the dalai lama , a potent symbol of greater independence for tibet , arrived in taiwan today for a visit that was immediately denounced by beijing as part of a scheme to break up china although , or perhaps because , his trip is fraught with political sensitivity , the redrobed and eversmiling tibetan leader was welcomed at the kaohsiung airport by taiwanese buddhist leaders who portrayed the sixday visit as a religious venture the dalai lama , worshiped by tibetans as a god and a king , tried to minimize the political tenor of the trip , his first ever to taiwan , saying that he intended to promote human values and spirituality i'm looking forward to seeing your president lee tenghui , the dalai lama also said after his arrival always keep in mind that any activities of mine should not bring any embarrassment to anybody but simply by setting foot in taiwan , the dalai lama highlighted several sides of a seemingly unsolvable puzzle chinese sovereignty no issue is more politically delicate in china , taiwan or tibet and yet none is so mired in seemingly outdated claims and counterclaims taiwan s governing nationalist party still formally asserts sovereignty over all of mainland china , including tibet , although its control has been limited to the island of taiwan for nearly 50 years it is a measure of the convoluted nature of chinataiwan relations that leaders in beijing might be more concerned than anyone if taiwan relinquished its claim to sovereignty over tibet , since this would suggest that the nationalists were also diluting their traditional support for reunification with the mainland a movement in taiwan toward formal independence from china is still relatively small but has tempered the nationalist position welcoming the dalai lama seems to point to a new flexibility in taiwan s official stance toward tibet of more pressing importance , perhaps , is an expected meeting between two men that china sees as its prime enemies the dalai lama , who was awarded a nobel peace prize in 1991 for his efforts to gain greater autonomy for tibetans , and mr lee , who won taiwan s first democratic presidential elections a year ago this second event brought taiwan to the brink of armed conflict with china though it seems unlikely that the two men would form any sort of alliance , formal or otherwise , their planned meeting has alarmed china s leaders today , beijing portrayed the dalai lama s visit to taiwan as an occasion for a meeting of two traitorous renegades trying to fracture china taiwan authorities and the dalai lama clique are colluding and using each other , the people s daily said , consorting with evildoers , going further and further down the road of splitting the motherland when the dalai lama arrived today in kaohsiung , a southern port city , two groups of political activists had gathered , one to welcome his visit , the other to oppose it the first group , numbering perhaps 200 , expressed support for formal independence for taiwan by saying no to china , one banner read , the dalai lama is a shining example for lee tenghui the second group , backing taiwan s unification with china , accused mr lee s government of indirectly approving tibetan independence by welcoming the dalai lama they shouted , no to tibetan independence , yes to one nation and a united china ! reuters reported the dalai lama is scheduled to meet mr lee on thursday the tibetan leader told taiwan s state television in a recent interview that he wanted to show his admiration for mr lee and to discuss spiritual issues mr lee is a devout methodist technically , the dalai lama s visit to taiwan marks the first time he has set foot in chinese territory since 1959 , when he fled tibet after chinese forces consolidated their control over the himalayan region that year , taiwan officially praised a tibetan revolt against chinese rule as part of a larger struggle against communism but taiwan has never actively supported independence for tibet

washington , jan 17 following is the text of analysis and conclusion , chapter 9 of the report by james m cole , special counsel to the committee on standards of official conduct on the conduct of speaker newt gingrich a tax issues in reviewing the evidence concerning both the aow actv \( mr gingrich s television programs , american opportunity workshop and american citizens' television \) project and the renewing american civilization project , certain patterns became apparent in both instances , gopac \( mr gingrich s political action committee \) had initiated the use of the messages as part of its political program to build a republican majority in congress in both instances there was an effort to have the material appear to be nonpartisan on its face yet serve as a partisan , political message for the purpose of building the republican party under the methodology test set out by the internal revenue service , both projects qualified as educational however , they both had substantial partisan , political aspects both were initiated as political projects , and both were motivated , at least in part , by political goals the other striking similarity is that in both situations , gopac was in need of a new source of funding for the projects and turned to a 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) organization for that purpose once the projects had been established at the 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) organizations , however , the same people continued to manage it as had done so at gopac , the same message was used as when it was at gopac , and the dissemination of the message was directed toward the same goal as when the project was at gopac building the republican party the only significant difference was that the activity was funded by a 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) organization this was not a situation where one entity develops a message through a course or a television program for purely educational purposes , and then an entirely separate entity independently decides to adopt that message for partisan , political purposes rather , this was a coordinated effort to have the 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) organization help in achieving a partisan , political goal in both instances the idea to develop the message and disseminate it for partisan , political use came first the use of the 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) came second as a source of funding this factual analysis was accepted by all members of the subcommittee and the special counsel however , there was a difference of opinion as to the result under 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) when applying the law to these facts ms roady , the subcommittee s tax expert , was of the opinion that the facts presented a clear violation of 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) because the evidence showed that the activities were intended to benefit mr gingrich , gopac , and other republican candidates and entities mr holden , mr gingrich s tax attorney , disagreed he found that the course was nonpartisan in its content , and even though he assumed that the motivation for disseminating it involved partisan , political goals , he did not find a sufficiently narrow targeting of the dissemination to conclude that it was a private benefit to anyone some members of the subcommittee and the special counsel agreed with ms roady and concluded that there was a clear violation of 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) with respect to aow actv and renewing american civilization other members of the subcommittee were troubled by reaching this conclusion and believed that the facts of this case presented a unique situation that had not previously been addressed by the legal authorities as such , they did not feel comfortable supplanting the functions of the internal revenue service or the tax court in rendering a ruling on what they believed to be an unsettled area of the law b statements to committee the letters mr gingrich submitted to the committee concerning the renewing american civilization complaint were very troubling to the subcommittee they contained definitive statements about facts that went to the heart of the issues placed before the committee in the case of the dec 8 , 1994 , letter , it was in response to a direct request from the committee for specific information relating to the partisan , political nature of the course and gopac s involvement in it both letters were efforts by mr gingrich to have the committee dismiss the complaints without further inquiry in such situations , the committee does and should place great reliance on the statements of members the letters were prepared by mr gingrich s lawyers after the subcommittee deposed the lawyers , the reasons for the statements being in the letters was not made any clearer the lawyers did not conduct any independent factual research looking at the information the lawyers used to write the letters , the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis for the inaccurate statements contained therein a number of exhibits attached to the complaint were fax transmittal sheets from gopac while this did not on its face establish anything more than gopac s fax machine having been used for the project , it certainly should have put the attorneys on notice that there was some relationship between the course and gopac that should have been examined before saying that gopac had absolutely no involvement in the course

los angeles , march 22 asianamericans organized better than they ever had for the elections in november , and they delivered a majority of their votes to president clinton , while donating completely legally at least 10 million to his campaign in return , they hoped to gain what any politically ambitious group seeks access and influence , particularly through political appointments so far , they have won little , other than frustration asianamerican groups , just as they were building political power commensurate with their rapidly growing numbers and wealth , are now complaining bitterly that they have come under unwarranted suspicion because of improper donations to the democratic party by some chinese and indonesians many of those concerns have focused on the prospects of four asianamericans who the groups had hoped would gain coveted political posts none of the appointments have been made , and several asianamerican advocates say they are growing increasingly anxious that they may be shut out because of a bunker mentality in the white house over the questionable donations the deepest worry is that if president clinton does not support some asianamerican candidates , he might only encourage what asianamericans say is a growing stereotype that there is no real difference between the wealthy chinese and indonesians who may have made improper donations and asianamericans who are solid citizens and have played by the rules the worry is that people with my kind of face now feel like they are the last people the president wants to be close to , said bruce l ishimatsu , a lawyer and the president of the asian pacific bar of california but the president is the only one who can change the atmosphere , who can say , 'this is n't about asianamericans' and he has n't done that i just wish someone in a position of power would draw the distinction otherwise , this just feeds the stereotypes such frustration and anger has increased with the latest cover of the national review magazine the cover , which has generated protests about racism , shows a caricature of president clinton and hillary rodham clinton with exaggerated chinese features and wearing stereotypical chinese clothes the magazine has denied accusations of racism the administration s point has been that the current controversy has had no impact on their appointment decisions , said daphne kwok , executive director of the organization of chinese americans , an advocacy group based in washington until we have some highlevel appointments , the asianamerican community is going to be very skeptical of that asked whether the questions involving asian contributors had harmed asianamericans' chances for appointments , bob nash , director of presidential personnel in the white house , said that it had not everyone is cognizant of the news , he said but it has not affected us that would be racist we are continuing to do as the president said , to create an administration that looks like america one reason asianamerican groups say they have grown so bitter is the way some of their members were questioned by democratic national committee auditors after the improper donations from noncitizens began to surface the auditors contacted donors with asian surnames who had given large contributions and asked whether they were american citizens and whether the money had come from legitimate sources it makes you feel like a secondclass citizen when they look at the color of your skin and your last name and then ask if you 're a citizen before they accept your money , said charlie woo , who is a prominent chineseamerican businessman here , a major democratic party donor and the head of a political action committee it makes me angry stewart kwoh of the asian pacific american legal center said people felt it was like the police interrogating a suspect it was devastating that atmosphere has clearly not helped the prospects for the political appointments , and that is a growing source of anger we very much believe that the scandal is the reason why we have not gotten any appointments yet , said thomas chan , a lawyer here and the former chairman of chinese americans unite for self empowerment it has been very frustrating the asianamerican groups had focused their hopes on four prospects ginny gong , bill lee , fred pang and changlin tien mr pang , a chineseamerican who is assistant secretary of defense for force management policy , is being considered for two high positions , secretary of the air force and under secretary for personnel and readiness , pentagon sources said but the atmosphere of suspicion in washington may have affected his chances if there used to be a push to have more asianamericans in the administration and now you have this scandal , does promoting asianamericans remain one of your goals \? asked a senior defense department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity probably not it s unfortunate that any time something like this happens , you have to prove yourself a little bit more mr tien , the wellregarded chancellor of the university of california at berkeley , was promoted in december to be named secretary of energy that would have made him the first asianamerican to hold a cabinet post but his candidacy was shelved after it was reported that month that he had helped relatives of mochtar riady , the indonesian businessman at the heart of the campaign contribution allegations , gain entry to berkeley no accusations of improprieties were made against mr tien for what was , essentially , a routine activity , but there still appeared to have been a taint mr lee is a highly experienced lawyer in los angeles with the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc he is a candidate for assistant attorney general for civil rights , and several people in the justice department said his chances were strong but mr lee has received only tepid support , several people said , from senator dianne feinstein of california , whose recommendation , as his senator , could be crucial susan kennedy , a spokeswoman for ms feinstein , said that the senator had been asked to write a letter of support and had written one , but that she had never met mr lee ms gong s case is more complex , and it illustrates another problem for asianamericans the lack of a clear national voice for them and divisions among them several asianamerican groups are pushing to have ms gong named executive director of the commission on civil rights she is now an administrator in the montgomery county , md , school system , involved with civil rights but the administration wants to name ruby moy to that position , officials said ms moy , who is also chineseamerican , has been an assistant to alexis herman , a white house official whom the president has nominated to be labor secretary various asianamerican groups say ms moy has not been active in asianamerican affairs and is not as qualified as ms gong the bottom line is we want the most qualified person in that job , in part because they are going to face a lot of scrutiny , said michael lin , national president of the organization of chinese americans and a science administrator at the national institutes of health we want the president to demonstrate that the asianamerican community has supported him and that we have earned his support
washington , aug 6 the clinton administration today announced a shift in the american strategy toward the middle east , in which it will press israel and the palestinians to negotiate much more quickly on the shape of a final peace settlement in an effort to restore the confidence lost in bitter disputes over interim measures secretary of state madeleine k albright outlined the new approach today , one week after a deadly bombing in jerusalem threw the middle east into a new level of anxiety and rancor , and president clinton drew attention to her very important speech about an hour later at a news conference on the south lawn ms albright said , we now face a crisis of confidence that has put at risk past gains and rekindled old animosities thus instead of using the gradual approach agreed to in the oslo peace accords , which were supposed to build confidence as the two sides resolved lesser issues , she said the united states hoped to restore momentum by getting the parties to focus on their ultimate goal , a final peace settlement prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel made a similar proposal in april , but the plan was rejected by yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , as well as other arab leaders in the region american officials are exploring ways to give mr arafat more confidence in such a strategy now , including the presence of american diplomats at the table the issues in a final settlement are the most complicated and bitter facing arabs and israelis , going to the heart of whether the palestinians will actually have a state , its future borders , and whether the two sides can resolve their competing claims to jerusalem under the steps ms albright outlined today , washington would first insist that the palestinian authority and its chairman , mr arafat , move sharply against terrorism , including full cooperation with the israelis both ms albright and president clinton made clear that no progress could be made without first assuring security in the region , and both made pointed criticisms of mr arafat in their remarks today until the parties trust each other and until the israelis believe that the palestinian authority is making 100 percent effort , which is different from 100 percent results , but is making 100 percent effort on security , it is impossible for peace to proceed , mr clinton said he said that dennis ross , the presidential envoy , would travel to the middle east on saturday to try to reestablish security cooperation between the two sides , to give the israelis the confidence they need in mr arafat s good will then , in a shift toward a more visible and highlevel american role , ms albright would make her first visit to the region as secretary of state to press both sides for real political progress and accelerated negotiations toward a final peace , probably during the last week of august speaking of palestinian militants who have set off the bombs to derail peace , mr clinton said it is imperative that mr arafat understand that those people are not his friends either those people do not want a peace whatever mr arafat s political grievances against the israelis , mr clinton said , none of that can be an excuse for not maintaining security while condemning the bombings , mr arafat has said it is not even clear that the bombers came to jerusalem from areas under his control the criticism of mr arafat on the security issue was a major theme of the administration today , but mr netanyahu was also the target of more veiled criticism ms albright listed some of mr arafat s complaints against the israelis , including settlement activity , construction at har homa and confiscation of land israel s decision earlier this year to proceed with a housing project for jews at har homa , in largely arab east jerusalem , was a major factor in the deterioration of relations between mr arafat and mr netanyahu should mr ross s trip go well , and the israelis and palestinians begin talking again , ms albright would take up how to get the two sides to negotiate seriously about socalled final status talks these talks are meant to settle the borders of a palestinian entity , which mr arafat intends to be a state , and the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital the final status talks opened ceremonially in may 1996 , just before mr netanyahu was elected on a platform of tough security following a spate of suicide bombings the talks have never reopened if the parties have a clear mutual and favorable sense of the ultimate direction of negotiation , it will be easier for them to overcome setbacks and avoid distractions along the way , ms albright said in her speech to the national press club this will require accelerating permanent status negotiations today this step is urgent and important the oslo accords were supposed to build trust between israelis and palestinians in a stepbystep process , but clearly the strategy was n't working , a senior administration official said today , and six months of the peace process have been wasted in recriminations and a failure of both sides even to talk so thinking how to rebuild confidence while regaining lost time , he said , we needed to intensify permanent status talks the incremental logic of gradualism was n't going to work
mamaroneck they belong to different species they are separated by years but frances racusin , 93 , and the young pet cockatiels at the sarah r neuman nursing home here definitely communicate on a recent day , mrs racusin put her nose to the cage and talked soothingly to the grayandyellow birds , which seemed agitated by a sudden flurry of visitors ok , ok , nice birds , pretty birds , pretty , pretty , pretty birds , she said in soft , low tones what are you doing \? do you want to come closer to me \? i love you , you know that as she spoke , the birds did , indeed , become calmer ruffled feathers smoothed frenzied motion subsided small , bright avian eyes and large , bespectacled human ones locked gazes they respond to me , mrs racusin said you stop and think it s miraculous , they have a brain and they use that brain they use it to communicate the cockatiels are part of a pet therapy program that also includes visits from volunteers' dogs and another bird , an extraordinarily tame peach moluccan cockatoo but unlike those creatures , which come and go , the cockatiels have been designated permanent residents one pair , in the wing for people with alzheimer s disease , is cared for by staff members the patients can do little more with them than watch their antics the other duo , however , is in the lobby of the pavilion , where residents some in their late 90 s function with minimal , if any , assistance , are completely alert and do such things as take trips to theaters and museums for them especially for mrs racusin the birds are almost like children , creatures to respect , nurture and love the cockatiels have become part of the family for many of our residents , said helen morgan , director of therapeutic recreation frances , for example , feels very , very responsible for them deborah marks kahn , assistant director of therapeutic recreation , added these birds are quite smart they relate well to people equally important is whether the people relate well to them dr john r pisciotta , a veterinarian with the rye harrison veterinary hospital who has a special interest in birds , said they are sensitive , intelligent and , in some ways , very delicate not only is it crucial to provide a bird with proper diet and environment but one should also try to understand its behavior some researchers are now saying that certain parrots actually have exhibited reasoning ability , he said none of which surprises mrs racusin since the cockatiels , which are members of the parrot family , arrived last summer , she has been reading books about their natural history and care , cleaning their cage , feeding them and overseeing the latest developments the laying of eggs and hatching of babies eight weeks ago , she suggested attaching a wooden brooder box to the cage shortly afterward , she observed pete and repeat , as they are named , mating not long after that , inside the brooder box , there were eggs that both the male and the female birds took turns warming and , three weeks after the first egg was laid , the tiny , downy , chirping chicks appeared do you know how the babies get fed \? mrs racusin asked rhetorically i feed the parents this special formula food , then the mother regurgitates it up for the little ones to eat little cockatiels mature quickly , however , and eight weeks after the three youngsters were born , they were eating on their own and ready to be placed in new homes mrs racusin and her friends leonora flam , 98 , and paula trachtenberg , 94 , watched as two of the young ones were transferred , individually , to separate cages belonging to the staff members , who each agreed to adopt one bird mrs flam said she would miss them mrs trachtenberg recalled her own pet birds of many years ago , and mrs racusin was quiet , her expression solemn and concerned i'm worried they 'll get lonely , she said the third young bird , named spotty for his speckled feathers , is supposed to be donated to a children s hospital , but , if that plan fails , he will need a home i hope spotty goes to someone who understands and knows how to care for him he s the youngest and the smallest , mrs racusin said mrs racusin and the others will still have pete and repeat and , she observed , repeat has already laid another egg they will also have visits from king tut , the cockatoo king tut , whose feathers are the color of peach ice cream , belongs to madeline gilbert , a librarian at the mamaroneck avenue school , a few blocks from the nursing home ms gilbert has had the twoandahalfyearold bird since he was three months old because his wings are clipped just enough to prevent him from flying away , she is able to take him with her to school as well as to sarah neuman born and raised in captivity , he has imprinted on humans and is as responsive to people as a puppy he s a very focused , very centered , very peopleoriented bird , ms gilbert said he loves to meet new people and show them his tricks he can do little threedimensional puzzles with his feet on a recent day , after visiting mrs racusin and the others in the pavilion , ms gilbert wound her way through a labyrinth of halls , with king tut balanced on her shoulder she eventually came to the room of sophie hammond , 60 , who is rendered virtually immobile by multiple sclerosis lying on her back in bed , with nothing moving but her mouth and eyes , ms hammond managed to convey her delight when king tut climbed her bed rails and perched delicately on her collarbone he can come here any time he wants to , she said in a barely audible voice bird and human looked at each other as if on cue , king tut gave her a gentle peck with his beak any time at all photos sophie hammond , left , greets king tut at sarah r neuman nursing home in mamaroneck frances racusin , above , with cockatiels madeline gilbert , below , with her pet , king tut \( photographs by joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
cincinnati , june 9 what wonderful fodder bobby jones chooses to ignore as he slowly pieces together a season worthy of consideration for the cy young award the mets pitcher will not discuss the prospect of starting the allstar game or the possibility of getting 20 victories , and he focused so hard on todd hundley s catcher s mitt today that he never noticed the nutty fan spying on behalf of cincinnati hitters concentrating with the intense stare of a curious squirrel , jones pitched eight innings to beat the reds , 42 , curtailing a brief mets lull that was on the verge of developing into a bona fide slump the mets \( 3427 \) , who had lost the first two games of this series , snapped a 22 tie in the eighth when john olerud scored on stan belinda s wild pitch , making jones a winner for the 11th time this season against 2 losses no other national league pitcher has more than eight victories no team had the sort of overt intelligence available to the reds today a fan sitting behind home plate began alerting the hometown team to the location of jones s pitches in the fourth inning hundley would call for a fastball away from the hitter , then shift his body to set up his target outside , and the fan would yell , outside ! in a voice clearly audible in the nearly vacant cinergy field hundley would call for a pitch inside and move , and the fan would holler , inside ! it bothered hundley , who eventually asked the umpires bruce froemming and mark hirschbeck to identify the culprit bruce said he would move the guy , but i wanted him to be kicked out , hundley said for a time , hundley said , he did not think the hitters really believed in the guy but once hundley began complaining to the umpires , he sensed that infielders bret boone and jeff branson realized what a potential weapon they had at their disposal hundley began changing his routine , calling for a pitch inside , sliding outside momentarily before sliding back inside , and hundley guessed that he successfully crossed up the fan a halfdozen times mets manager bobby valentine eventually identified the spy in the eighth inning , after the umpires had been unable to do so , and every time he saw the fan cup his mouth to yell , valentine yelled , too , uttering utter nonsense as loud as he possibly could the situation was distracting , valentine acknowledged , in a close game in which the mets and reds were never more than two runs apart \( valentine said he very much doubted that the reds planted the spy , because this was far too blatant \) jones , who has now won eight consecutive starts , tying a mets record , knew none of this , and probably would not have cared if he had his concentration has been almost unshakeable this season , and jones pitched out of major jams early the reds were 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position in the first two innings the mets were leading by 20 when branson hit a tworun homer off jones in the bottom of the seventh after olerud scored the goahead run in the top of the eighth , jones pitched the bottom of the eighth before giving way to john franco with this final line seven hits , two runs , no walks , four strikeouts afterward , he deflected questions about the allstar game , recalling recent advice from his father , robert jones sr he said , 'keep your head between your shoulders , ' jones said 'do n't get caught up in the success , do n't look ahead , go one pitch at a time' bob apodaca , the pitching coach , said of jones he s got the perfect makeup for someone to let everything roll off his back he knows he s good , he knows he s a good pitcher and he does n't need any more than that inside pitch bobby jones is among a handful of met allstar candidates , along with todd hundley \( 287 , 13 homers , 41 runs batted in \) , john olerud \( 324 , 42 rbi \) and closer john franco \( 16 saves , 148 era \) but franco says he is not getting his hopes too high because he was passed over in 1994 and 1995 for reasons he did not understand one time by atlanta manager bobby cox , who picks this year it would be nice , near the end of my career , but it s out of my control , said franco , adding that he did not know if he had done anything to offend the braves i just saved games against them randy niemann might have been immortalized on some blooper reel , but alas , no camera recorded the acrobatics of the bullpen coach in the top of the ninth inning monday franco finished warming up in the visitors' bullpen , along the leftfield foul line , and flipped the baseball over his shoulder blindly right toward the field of play , as reds reliever jeff shaw threw home niemann reached for the ball , caught his spike on the crest of the bullpen mound , and tumbled into fair territory as he made the catch niemann explained what happened before adding with a smile , ok , and now let s forget about that jones had an rbi single in the second inning , his sixth hit of the year his fellow starter mark clark is 0 for 25 this season and is taking some goodnatured abuse for dragging down the averages of the mets' pitchers when i start hitting , look out , clark said i guarantee you i 'll have a hit by september photo bobby jones pitching against cincinnati yesterday afternoon he threw eight innings , giving up two runs and seven hits \( associated press \)
to the editor your dec 30 frontpage report that conservative republicans will continue to block america s contractual obligations to the united nations unless the new secretary general , kofi annan , convinces them that he is determined to streamline the world organization s budget and bureaucracy can only cause incredulity to our allies abroad and deep concern to americans who worry about the rising global challenges of the decades to come of course the united nations should strive to be as efficient and costeffective as possible , reduce the overlaps that exist and have the highest quality of personnel but if those worthy aims are only a euphemism for downsizing , that misses the point as to why we need the world organization in the first place despite the growth in overall prosperity over the past decades , there are large swaths of our planet that look headed for troubles early next century \( if not before \) social collapse , further civil wars , mass migrations and resource depletion are not unlikely add to that the dangers from continued arms proliferation , expanding drug regimes , piracy and terrorism , and the possible results are not pleasant to contemplate all these trends could hurt the world s no 1 power , yet none of them could be dealt with by uncle sam acting alone which the american public does n't want in any case global threats of this magnitude can be countered only by orchestrated and empowered global responses it s as simple as that in such circumstances , senator jesse helms s call for reform is imprudent even if the united nations were the most efficient , bestrecruited and leanest organization the world had ever seen , its present level of resources and personnel would not enable it to meet the demands that member states including this country will place upon it in the years to come cleaning out the stables should only be the first step in a longterm policy of working with other governments to enhance the united nations' overall capacities is n't it time for the clinton administration , led perhaps by its new secretary of state , to explain more convincingly why america really needs the united nations in the decades ahead \? paul kennedy new haven , dec 30 , 1996 the writer is a professor of history at yale
in the days since the clinton administration certified that mexico is fully cooperating in the fight against illegal drugs , officials in mexico city and washington have offered conflicting accounts of what if anything was agreed to in lastminute talks the ambiguity is understandable , and politically useful to both countries officials say none of the undertakings were written down , allowing both presidents room to maneuver with their restive legislatures and in public , united states officials have taken pains to avoid clarifying precisely what was decided but in extensive interviews in the last few days , administration officials have said their mexican counterparts made some broad commitments to resolve some longstanding disagreements between the two countries on how to fight drug trafficking they insisted that the commitments were not tied directly to the certification decision announced last friday robert s gelbard , the assistant secretary of state for narcotics matters , said yesterday that there never was any quid pro quo saying , 'you do this and you get certified' but he acknowledged that mexican officials understood the need to demonstrate concrete results from our cooperation he declined to provide details the talks became more intense after the mexican authorities disclosed that they had arrested gen jesus gutierrez rebollo , the country s top antidrug official , on charges of collaborating with one of mexico s most notorious drug barons one mexican official spoke of the need to alleviate the political emotionalism created by the general s arrest in the days that followed , american officials said mexico had assured them that it would step up extradition of drug traffickers , make greater use of new laws against money laundering and more carefully review the backgrounds of mexicans selected for antidrug operations with the united states mexican officials contend that they were planning to do these things without prodding from washington since the decision was announced on friday , the clinton administration has been stung by accusations by some in congress that it gave mexico a free ride without extracting enough concessions in return this is not a game where you tally up the points , ok \? nicholas burns , the state department spokesman , said yesterday what we 're trying to do is enhance the cooperation between the mexicans and the americans , mexico and the united states another senior administration official said mexico s certification was based on the belief that president ernesto zedillo truly wanted to reduce drug trafficking officials on both sides concur on a rough chronology of events about a week before the march 1 deadline for certification , the americans presented the mexicans with a list of drugrelated issues on which the united states wanted commitments those issues ranged from extradition of drug traffickers to more mexican prosecutions under the country s new moneylaundering and organized crime laws officials said extradition was at the top of the administration s list of about a halfdozen issues attorney general janet reno felt so strongly about it that by one account , she threatened to recommend that mexico not be certified unless more mexican traffickers were sent to the united states for trial mexican law does not allow mexican citizens to be extradited to other countries , except in special circumstances a senior mexican official said that last year the government decided to cite special circumstances to begin extraditing mexicans to the united states mexican officials have not previously acknowledged changing their extradition policy it would be wrong to say that there has been no change , the official said there has been no change in our law , but there has been change in our use of it he said that last week , foreign minister jose angel gurria and attorney general reno exchanged new lists of about a dozen people that each country wanted extradited by the other american officials say that of some 150 mexicans requested by the united states , mexico has extradited only 3 the most notorious , juan garcia abrego , a drug baron who headed the socalled gulf syndicate , was handed over early last year , tried in houston and sentenced to 11 life sentences in a united states prison but mr garcia abrego was actually deported on the ground that he held dual citizenship one of the remaining mexicans extradited last year was wanted for serial murders and the other for sexual abuse mexico s policy against law enforcement officials from the united states carrying sidearms while in mexico remains in force , but american officials expressed hope that it might soon be relaxed since 1992 , mexico has refused to let american drug agents travel armed in mexico , even though one such agent was kidnapped , viciously tortured and killed by traffickers in 1985 in testimony on capitol hill last tuesday , thomas a constantine , the head of the drug enforcement administration , said that because of an increase in threats against his agents working in mexico , he had suspended their participation in drug investigations across the border mr gelbard told the same house subcommittee that letting united states drug agents carry weapons was one of the very top issues raised by peter tarnoff , who was the acting secretary of state , and by ms reno when mr gurria visited washington two weeks ago we consider this one of our very top priorities , mr gelbard told the subcommittee we were given assurances that this will be resolved urgently a senior mexican official confirmed that the ban remained in place so far , the rules have stayed exactly where they are , the official said we are concerned about the security of dea agents working in mexico , but we do n't believe that the way to protect them is for them to carry guns some other issues remain unresolved the united states has long requested that navy and coast guard vessels be permitted to detain boats suspected of carrying drugs in mexican waters and turn them over to the mexican navy american and mexican officials said this matter had not been discussed in the talks before certification

\( teams are listed in predicted order of finish \) nfc east 1 dallas 1996 record 106 , division champion strengths the offense could be stacked michael irvin says the addition of wide receiver anthony miller will stop teams from doubleteaming him as much as they had and how do you stop the trio of irvin , miller and deion sanders at wide receiver \? the only concern there continues to be speculation that running back emmitt smith is hurting even though he says he is 100 percent healthy weaknesses the defense a lot of games could be 3530 shootouts defensive end charles haley has retired , defensive tackle leon lett will miss most of the season due to a drug suspension and the linebackers are suspect defensive tackle antonio anderson has been a pleasant surprise , though outlook no question , they 'll be good maybe great probably the only team in the nfc that has the offense particularly the running game to be a serious threat to green bay 2 giants 1996 record 610 strengths coach jim fassel has done an amazing job of instilling confidence in the team his most impressive work has been with the rookie running back tiki barber and the rookie wide receiver ike hilliard unlike former coach dan reeves , fassel likes his rookies to participate and excel not only will they do well , they have a chance to be great kicker brad daluiso may be the best in the game right now weaknesses depth is the big one , especially on the offensive line when center brian williams was hurt during training camp , there were several people in the organization who thought he would miss at least the first half of the season they may be right without him , the line is hurting phillippi sparks missing three to six weeks with hepatitis is a huge blow outlook last year the giants were last in total offense , passing , thirddown efficiency and yards per play under fassel those areas should improve dramatically as quarterback dave brown already looks like a different player and the defense , ranked 14th overall last year , should also be better there are plans to unveil some wild schemes now that the regular season is beginning the giants could end up being the surprise team of the league 3 washington 1996 record 97 strengths the redskins looked like one of the elite teams at the beginning of last season , winning seven of their first eight games then they lost six of their last seven what happened is still somewhat of a mystery and how well the redskins do this year depends on whether they have solved that mystery the redskins will still run the lowrisk , runoriented attack that features terry allen and produced almost 2 , 000 yards and 27 touchdowns and the efficient gus frerotte has been handed the reigns to the team the offense s consistency is its biggest asset weaknesses internal strife is something the redskins will have to keep in check who knows what effect michael westbrook s attack on teammate stephen davis will have on the team \? and the holdout of defensive lineman sean gilbert could last for months outlook the redskins had a defensive collapse last season that led to the firing of coordinator ron lynn and the hiring of mike nolan nolan had the reputation among some giants defensive players as being manipulative but he is on the fast track to becoming a head coach if he can improve the defense , the redskins could win the division 4 philadelphia 1996 record 106 , wild card strengths coach ray rhodes is one of the most intense coaches in the nfl he has done an amazing job of getting the eagles into the playoffs in each of his first two seasons weaknesses the reason the eagles have not been able to break through to the elite level of a dallas or green bay is because their quarterback has been either rodney peete or ty detmer and there is little chance the team will ever win a super bowl with either player outlook last year the eagles controlled the ball for more than 32 minutes a game , scored 363 points and averaged more than 350 yards of total offense and there is no reason that they wo n't produce numbers like that this season but detmer is fragile and in preseason the defense has been suspect 5 arizona 1996 record 79 strengths the cardinals had their second strong draft in a row , they won 7 of their last 13 games last season while some are ready to pencil in jake plummer at quarterback in place of kent graham , do n't count on it graham is poised to have an excellent year weaknesses there is no bigtime runner on the team fullback larry centers is more of a passcatcher the defense gave up 3351 yards a game and 397 total points last season outlook the team is clearly in a rebuilding stage their only hope is for graham to have a great season nfc central 1 green bay 1996 record 133 , super bowl champion strengths no team , with the possible exception of jacksonville , is as deep as the packers most of the credit for the team s success goes to general manager ron wolf he hired mike holmgren and traded a firstround pick for brett favre , the league s twotime most valuable player wolf brought reggie white to the packers he has stacked this team with talent that will keep the packers competitive for years weaknesses realistically , none their kicking game was a worry , but kicker ryan longwell made two field goals in an exhibition game against the giants of 49 and 50 yards outlook only an injury to favre can derail the team the packers are still the best in the league 2 tampa bay 1996 record 610
the hewlettpackard company , hoping to preempt an announcement scheduled for today by its rival , compaq computer , said yesterday that it planned to lower prices on its commercial desktop computers by as much as 24 percent , beginning next week the cuts , which are expected to be followed by compaq and matched by ibm , are the first concrete moves in an aggressive campaign by the three large personal computer makers to match the lower prices offered by dell computer , which has been growing at a much faster rate it promises to be a bonanza for corporate computer buyers since early this year , compaq has been recasting its relations with the thousands of independent dealers that sell its computers so that it can dramatically reduce the number of machines they hold in inventory today the company is expected to pass some of the expected cost savings to its customers by announcing a new line of desktop computers for businesses that will be priced competitively with those of dell but hewlettpackard said that it , too , had been improving the efficiency of its manufacturing and distribution and thus was also in a position to cut prices these price cuts are not going to compromise our profitability , said emilio ghilardi , the worldwide marketing manager of hewlett s commercial desktop personal computer business ibm , which is the secondlargest personal computer manufacturer in the world behind compaq , vowed not to be left behind we will be competitive , promised samuel j palmisano , the head of the personal computer division , though he declined to disclose any price reductions while compaq , hewlettpackard and ibm have to grapple with a large network of dealers , dell and other socalled direct vendors , including gateway 2000 and micron electronics , receive orders directly from customers , either by telephone or over the internet as a result , the direct vendors have been able to price their machines 10 to 15 percent cheaper than their larger competitors and are growing at a much faster pace their ability to hold onto the market is being challenged by dell , said matthew sargent , an analyst at computer intelligence in la jolla , calif dell could not be reached for comment but compaq , hewlett and ibm said they were convinced that if they could reduce the price difference to within 5 percent , corporate customers would be swayed by their records of quality and service if you remove the price advantage of dell , it is going to be pretty tough for them to grow as fast as they have , mr ghilardi said and that is what hewlettpackard intends to do mr ghilardi said that the company planned to offer a computer with a 233megahertz pentium ii chip and 32 megabytes of memory , a 25gigabyte harddisk drive but no monitor for a suggested retail price of 2 , 040 , 20 percent less than what hewlett charges today in practice , he added , the machine will likely sell for under 2 , 000 , the first time a pentium ii computer has broken that price barrier a similarly configured machine from dell currently costs about 2 , 000 compaq is also likely to introduce an equally aggressively priced line tomorrow , and dell could respond by further lowering its prices , leading to a price war but analysts said they did not think that a full price war would happen because none of the companies would be willing to sacrifice their profit margins compaq executives have said that they expect the company s profit margins , which were 245 percent in the last quarter , to expand , not shrink the key will be how successfully compaq can carry out its new distribution strategy richard schutte , an analyst at goldman , sachs company in new york , said that compaq was probably a more efficient manufacturer than dell but that its distribution network added an average 280 extra to the price of each compaq machine if they can capture just 50 of that , that is an additional 330 million in incremental operating profit , he said so far wall street is convinced that compaq , which will release its secondquarter earnings today , will be successful the company s stock has soared 2250 , or 23 percent , in the last 12 days , closing yesterday at a 52week high of 121 , up 1625 on the new york stock exchange despite evidence of a slowdown in personal computer sales , executives at both compaq and hewlettpackard have said that their secondquarter sales were strong some analysts believe that the companies are stealing share from smaller , lesserknown manufacturers because many corporate customers prefer to deal with a single supplier that is a consolidation that is likely to continue as the large players drop their prices in the months ahead

city college alumni in tuxedos and evening gowns packed the ballroom of manhattan s sheraton hotel last month to show their affection for a school that turned 150 years old yesterday these sons and daughters of the working class paid 500 a plate for the pleasure , more than their entire college educations had cost them \( books and subway tokens included \) the evening was a tribute to the astonishing achievement of a college that has become legendary as a proletarian harvard at one table sat five of the college s eight nobel prize winners , and at other tables were real estate magnates , wall street financiers , mayors , judges and newspaper editors there was a film that showed off such graduates as felix frankfurter , upton sinclair , bernard malamud and ira gershwin and the featured speaker was gen colin l powell , class of 1958 , the hero of the persian gulf war whose military career was spawned in the college s earlymorning rotc drills several miles uptown , at the college s campus in harlem , its 9 , 620 students are aware , sometimes frustratingly so , of this rich tradition and while the college is now very different from the white , largely jewish institution of decades past , with far more immigrants and more students who require remedial courses , they say it continues to meet its historic mission of transforming new york city s poor and working class and sending them off as doctors , engineers and social workers i think it s still the harvard of the poor , i just do n't think we realize that any more , said jonathan a flory , a junior majoring in music after open admissions in the 1970 s , people s view of city college dropped drastically , but the education did n't drop as far as people think it did and you 'll see at the upper echelons in every department people who could compete with any harvard or yale graduate the students say there are aspects to the college today that were n't there two or three generations ago , including an esprit de corps and a maturity that they say has flowered on a polyglot campus where half the students were born abroad , where 40 percent work at least half the week , and more than a few students bring children to class when they ca n't get baby sitters students here are survivors , said marcel hinds , who is in an undergraduate biomedical program that embraces the first two years of medical school you might as well be in a dormitory because students are here until 1 or 2 in the morning , and some sleeping over there a real camaraderie , a kind of struggling at a round table interview with 19 of the school s top scholars , students said the college is still an academic standout , with an accomplished , energetic and demanding faculty and programs that have qualified thousands of students for the professions , business and government but its reputation has been tarnished by a public focus on unpleasant news antisemitic remarks by a blackstudies professor , leonard jeffries , and a 1991 rap concert in a gymnasium at which nine young men and women , none of them college students , were trampled to death some graduate school administrators say the college has slipped , even though between 1983 and 1992 , 860 of its alumni earned doctorates , more phd s than columbia produced one new york university graduate school administrator who spoke on condition of anonymity said some applicants rival those at good private colleges , but there are fewer top prospects than there were 25 years ago today s city college is far different from the campus of old where tuition was free and in some years a high school average approaching 85 was essential for admission indeed , by the 1960 s the school had become so selective that it was attracting middle class students who felt there was no point in wasting money on an elite private school today , 383 percent of the students are black , 31 percent are hispanic , 154 percent are asian and 102 percent are white , roughly the proportions in the new york city schools students hail from 90 different nations , with substantial contingents from the dominican republic , jamaica , haiti , china , india , south korea , russia and poland while the admission average is still a relatively selective 80 , 1 , 000 students are admitted through the seek program , which requires a 70 average for those who meet criteria of financial need threequarters of the entering freshmen are assigned to at least one remedial or englishasasecondlanguage class the campus even looks different the graceful neogothic spire of shepherd hall has been dwarfed by two buildings of more workaday architecture and the south campus has been replaced by an athletic field the students at the round table lamented that the public does not know that city college , whose charter was signed on may 7 , 1847 , is a place where teachers with degrees from the finest ivy league schools continue to impose stiff standards and it is a place where students cannot take college for granted , the way some students in the 1960 s might have
mahwah , nj , march 17 sam cassell popped his head out of the lockerroom door like a cuckoo bird , cooing this simple phrase calipari , coach of the year then the baldshaven , broadsmiling cassell ducked behind a door that closed as coach john calipari laughed and replied , just as long as we negotiate right , huh , sam \? this was the playful exchange sunday this coziness that has existed between the coach and his point guard especially after the nets tilted logic in upsetting first the bulls and then the knicks has been as warm as freshbaked cookies and yet , the future of this relationship could come down to impersonal numbers this summer when cassell becomes a free agent this is already a satellite issue whirling around the feelgood world of the nets right now , an issue hard to ignore when cassell has been the one to guide the nets through a priceless weekend bulls victory , knicks victory what s it worth to keep a point guard averaging 20 points a game since he arrived in the dallas trade , to keep a player who can respond to calipari s emotional style \? cal is going to have to step up , cassell said after practice today and step lively several teams will probably try to woo the 27yearold cassell this summer right now , the salary he appears to have in mind is around 5 million to show the going pointguard rate , kenny anderson makes 7 million a year , while the former net robert pack pulls in a 3 million salary so it seems 5 million is not out of line if , like most , you rank cassell in between anderson and pack yet , those in the nets organization have shuddered at such a figure , although calipari has not openly flinched all i 've said to sam is , 'we 're going to be fair and you 're going to be fair , and we 'll get it worked out , ' calipari said we all want him here and he wants to be here and that s worth a lot to calipari he has been in search of a casselllike personality at point guard all year neither pack nor khalid reeves was calipari s type then along came cassell , a player who loosens up the nets like a good massage , a determined guy with soul and soles he and a former houston teammate , mario elie , have a fancy shoe store in houston samario s casual shoes , cassell said got your lizards , gator skins , whatever you want the store often brings him back to a city to which he once brought euphoria he was the sprite off the bench who led the rockets to a game 3 victory against the knicks in the 1994 national basketball association finals , scoring the game s last 7 points , including a steely 3pointer with 32 seconds left and he was the hot guard who shot and slashed for 31 points to push the rockets past the magic in game 2 of the 1995 finals but something happened after that , after the reebok commercial with his mom , and houston adulation charles barkley happened cassell was postmarked and sent to phoenix as a part of the barkley trade in august the stamp was not dry before he was shipped to dallas in the jason kidd deal now , the portable cassell is in new jersey , about to face a past that was addresses ago the nets play the rockets on tuesday i have won in houston , so that s something you 'll always remember , cassell said if houston goes and wins the championship this year , i 'll be disappointed because i'm not part of it it was great winning the two titles with houston , but you have to go on he could go on in new jersey he could carry on the style of play that gets calipari s spirits up about the future of this team cassell may fall in love with the basket at times he launched 24 shots against the knicks , and only made 8 but normally he takes what he can make and his teammates do not seem to mind , because cassell is hitting a teamhigh 455 percent since his arrival he has come in and made some big shots , kendall gill said i do n't feel like i have to make the big shot every night i feel comfortable putting the game in his hands he has two titles he has been to a place none of us have ever been to i hope he does come back here that is the kind of response calipari wants to hear he wants his players to feel as easy with cassell as he does calipari can tell cassell anything , in any way he can yell at him when cassell loses his mind on the court , and he can bench him during a bad stretch without alienating him at least so far sammy does not think he s james naismith , calipari said he listens to me and says , 'if that s good for the team , i 'll do that' i want that kind of player here such a cozy sentiment but just how close they will be in the future will be played out this summer

reader a thrill publish and perish three tales of tenure and terror , by james hynes , draws on the traditional mechanics of the genre suspense , surprise , an infusion of the supernatural but the thrill hynes delivers is of another order instead of the obligatory frisson of fear , he provides one of extravagant and unlikely fun , for he mixes his horror with the sophisticated intellectual farce of academic comedy hynes is fearlessly playful , a riveting storyteller and a graceful observer of human folly the result is delicious , a genre book for those who do n't really like genre books pure entertainment that is not a waste of time hynes s previous novel , the wild colonial boy , was a swift and quite sensitive thriller about an irishamerican boy drawn into ira terrorism publish and perish is something altogether different despite properly lurid morbidity , the sensibility is dry and comic this is not sour , black humor , as might be expected in an academic comedy , nor is it a satire of the horror genre in these three linked novellas , the horror is accepted , treated realistically , indulged the way an eccentric uncle would be in a more conventional novel publish and perish is a work of sheer joy , one that relishes the absurdity of academia , the extremes of ambition , the shallows and depths of love hynes s men and women \( and cats \) are subtle and touching the first two protagonists , villains in their own different ways , are sympathetic and almost lovable , so human is their vanity , so recognizable their weakness in queen of the jungle , an academic couple face the complications , the jealousy and mistrust , that occur when elizabeth rises in the universe of the university and her husband , paul , sinks he was the one who was supposed to carry her along on his scholarly coattails , but in fact it is elizabeth who has the tenuretrack job in chicago and paul who has a deadend position at an undistinguished college in bluff city , iowa queen of the jungle seems at first to be a witty story about a stressed married couple with a stressed cat something was wrong with paul and elizabeth s cat , charlotte , the story begins she was peeing outside of the litter box and driving her owners to distraction elizabeth commutes , coming home to paul and the cat each weekend , and paul notes her return to the smell of cat urine with a combination of affection and resentment elizabeth is so loving and concerned far more loving and concerned about charlotte than she is about him elizabeth had a sentimental streak where the cat was concerned she would n't be caught dead with vogue or glamour , but now and then paul glimpsed an issue of cat fancy in her briefcase james hynes is a man who understand cats and women , and who allows them both their revenge charlotte , we gradually learn , is urinating not just anywhere outside of her litter box , but on those spots where paul has been cheating on his wife with a blond grad student from california named kymberly queen of the jungle becomes a wildly inventive war of nerves between man and feline as paul tries to silence the cat and cash in on elizabeth s early tenure , while charlotte tries to expose him as an unfaithful cad she watches him through green cat eyes she retrieves bits of incriminating evidence and carefully hides them under the couch with her precious toy mousies poor paul marriage has always been more of an economic relationship than anything else , he tells kymberly the idea that love has anything to do with it is a fairly recent construction , dating from the romantic era elizabeth and i have a kind of affectionate professional partnership he is a sophist and a climber , but one s heart goes out to him all he wants is the tenure that his wife s clout can get for him and the only thing that comes between him and it is a cat , a clever cat who , unlike the clever paul , has known and understood love in this story , careers and marriages can meet sudden , violent ends , but true love never really dies , and neither do loyal kitties the second story , 99 , is about another ambitious , arrogant academic , an anthropologist named gregory eyck the son of a minister in the dutch reformed church , gregory had come away with two invaluable gifts from his father and the drc a cheerful ruthlessness in the practice of institutional politics , and a capacity for intellectual rigor within a closed theoretical system gregory is a star at his university until he organizes a conference \( 'captains' and 'cannibals' the cultural constructions of the death of captain cook \) that runs amok because of a poster that inadvertently offends a student of third world ancestry , who also happens to be gregory s lover 'why is the pacific islander

the brother of the princess of wales said it devastatingly and correctly , in a sentence of icy passion from which there is no hiding place it would appear that every proprietor and editor of every publication that has paid for intrusive and exploitative photographs of her , encouraging greedy and ruthless individuals to risk everything in pursuit of diana s image , has blood on his hands today no hiding place none for the executives who permit and encourage press harassment unto death , for no other reason than to increase their own profits and salaries , and none for journalists who say they would never use such pictures but create excuses of moral , ethical and professional garbage to explain those who do someday , i believe , the words of earl spencer will hang in the private offices of publishers , network chiefs , and print and electronic editors worthy of any respect or trust one way to speed that day is to expose the excuses as swiftly as possible and get on with root reality about the crash itself , the essential details involving the press are two the princess and emad mohamed alfayed jumped into a limousine to try to escape a gang of photographers pursuing them on motorcycles to their private destination the chase killed them was the chauffeur driving too fast \? did he have too much to drink \? did his passengers tell him to slow down , or go faster to escape the gang behind \? those are questions perhaps pertinent in deciding the sentence the photographers should pay but this fact remains and will forever had that gang not chased the couple , the princess and her friend would be alive today , knowing they would be chased again and again , but that perhaps with luck they would not die some other night on some other road fleeing some other gang of photographers now , for the reality that brought the photographers to the ritz and the princess and mr fayed to their deaths money the paparazzi , as they like to be called , pursued the couple as a jackal his prey they knew that a good picture like a kiss or hug seen through a car window would bring scores of thousands of dollars and that any picture would bring a price handsome enough for their gas and waiting time until the next gathering of the jackals , the next day the pictures would be bought by certain newspapers , magazines and tv networks to attract readers and advertisers spending money to make money sometimes the awaiting picture and writing jackals are staff people but often the money is laundered not enough to cover the stink through independent photo agencies that permits the executives to say that the photographers do not work for them , that often they do not even know their names and that certainly they would not give them credentials ! it permits journalists who do not do this kind of filthy work to say that the photographers and freelance writing dirtdiggers who sometimes hang around them are not really journalists at all , and it is not right to lump us all together no but neither is it right for real journalists not to acknowledge that enough more mainstream newspapers and glossypaper magazines print that kind of picture , and are publishing more unverified and sadistic gossip of their own creation that enough tv news shows harassed jackie onassis almost to her deathbed , and then played the jackal around her children that enough hordes of reporters and photographers routinely camp like arrogant occupiers on the lawns of ordinary people somehow caught in the news that enough newspaper people play the fool for money by snarling and barking at each other on tv yap shows that there is enough of all this going on that very soon the public may not be able to tell the difference between real journalists and all those others , and , heaven help us , neither may we in america we do not need new laws or industrywide selfregulation we do not have to give up our constitutional rights to have a free press all we need is a couple of hundred americans , each acting as individual editors and publishers , who have enough selfrespect to give figures in the news the space , safety and civility they would demand for themselves , their spouses and their children on the day they find the tape recorders , reporters' pads and cameras outside , waiting for them
chicago , sept 6 when student reporters for the naperville central times , a suburban high school newspaper , learned that district administrators spent taxpayers' money on travel at the time of a budget crisis , they did what any responsible journalist might do they investigated using public records , they uncovered the expense vouchers of three principals and one administrator , who spent an average of 1 , 400 each to attend professional conferences in new york , new orleans , san francisco and phoenix but the information never made it into the paper tom paulsen , the principal of naperville central high school , directed the students to remove the administrators' names before publication his action , three years ago , thrust naperville central , a school of 2 , 700 in an affluent bedroom community west of chicago , into rekindling a longstanding journalistic debate do high school newspapers have the same constitutional rights as the rest of the press \? lawmakers in illinois broadly answered yes by a wide margin they passed a bill restricting administrators' powers of prior review but last month , the illinois governor , jim edgar , vetoed the bill the legislation creates a situation in which the entity ultimately responsible for the newspaper the school board cannot exercise full control over the paper s content , mr edgar said in his aug 10 veto message he said he feared the bill would make school boards vulnerable to lawsuits the governor s surprise veto has angered many civil liberties groups and brought lawyers from around the country to the aid of the naperville students the issue of freedom of the press for high school newspapers was taken as far as the supreme court nine years ago , when it ruled that a high school principal in missouri could censor the school newspaper because an article interfered with the school s basic educational mission the court s language in that case , which has become known as the hazelwood decision , has led to confusion , however , with varying interpretations of who determines educational mission and how it is defined that confusion has prompted a number of states to establish guidelines of their own arkansas , california , colorado , iowa , kansas and massachusetts have decided that student journalists should be protected , establishing laws that permit administrators to intervene only when a publication uses obscenity or libelous material or invades privacy the illinois legislature had passed a similar measure mark goodman , executive director of the student press law center in arlington , va , said governor edgar s concern was unfounded schools are sued hundreds of more times for events that take place on the athletic fields , mr goodman said , yet no one is suggesting that the principal should be calling plays in the huddle proponents of the illinois measure are weighing whether to accept the veto , push for a legislative override or introduce a new bill at naperville , mr paulsen said recently that he supported the governor s veto administrators have the responsibility to allow the students as much freedom as possible , he said , but many times we have the experience and the perspective that the students or adviser may not have to recognize when a situation may be harmful mr paulsen said the article on spending was the only one he had ever censored my concern , he said , was that there may have been an appearance that these administrators did something wrong and that would affect their ability to lead all four administrators' vouchers raised questions about their expenses the administrator visiting san francisco , for example , was reimbursed for five nights in a hotel even though his conference was two days but none of the administrators was found to have misspent any money for their part , the naperville student reporters , who are now in college , say mr paulsen s actions worked to their advantage it really backfired for him , said sal shaw , now at the university of illinois this would n't have received nearly the attention that it did if he would have let us print the names the article appeared with an editor s note explaining that the students had been censored , but it listed the voucher numbers they had uncovered , making it easier for others to look up the names the students also gave the names to professional reporters in chicago , and they published them mr shaw said he felt that the students had made their point administrators do n't trust that we can act responsibly , he said this is about giving students their voice back
washington , june 22 for six months , as congress has considered farreaching proposals to regulate managed health care , the industry has waged a public relations offensive under the slogan putting patients first but last week , lobbyists for the industry mobilized an extremely different offensive , resisting any requirement to pay for patients who go to hospital emergency rooms reporting severe pain the budget bill coming up for debate in the senate and the house this week would establish new protections for elderly people who join health maintenance organizations the measure says , for example , that health plans have to pay for emergency care in any situation that a prudent lay person would regard as an emergency the lobbyists are working overtime to put their imprint on the legislation as congress , following the lead of many states , sets standards for the quality of care patients , doctors and hospitals say hmo s have often refused to pay for emergencyroom services , saying there was no real emergency , if , for example , chest pains resulted from indigestion rather than a heart attack such denials can leave patients with thousands of dollars in medical bills and discourage them from seeking emergency care hmo s contend that federal standards are unnecessary and set a bad precedent for government intervention in the practice of medicine in the last few weeks , as three congressional committees endorsed the prudent lay person standard , more than a dozen hmo lobbyists patrolled the halls , pressing their case senators bob graham , democrat of florida , and john h chafee , republican of rhode island , proposed an amendment to make clear that severe pain might be a symptom of an emergency medical condition the senate finance committee approved the proposal , 17 to 3 but the fight , which continues as the legislation moves to the floor , epitomizes the struggle over countless items in the budget bill the american association of health plans , the national lobby for hmo s and other managedcare companies , developed talking points for its members to use in attacking the grahamchafee proposal in strongly urging lawmakers to oppose the amendment , the association makes these arguments pain is a highly subjective term and has vast differences in meaning among consumers , depending on their threshold or tolerance for pain overuse of hospital emergency rooms drives up health care costs and harms care hospital emergencyroom waiting times are often extensive , causing patients to leave without any medical intervention incorrect medications are often prescribed , and medical conditions are often misdiagnosed because emergencyroom doctors have none of the patients' medical records the document in which the arguments were published carries no letterhead or other indication of its source but in an interview , kristin bass , director of legislative affairs at the american association of health plans , said it was prepared here at aahp it was written by our policy analysts and people in our medical affairs department the president of the association , karen m ignagni , said the talking points had been distributed to washington representatives , lawyers and lobbyists for 70 hmo s who meet once a week to coordinate strategy ms ignagni asked , if you have a root canal and experience severe pain , does that justify a visit to the emergency room \? another hmo lobbyist said mr graham s amendment would require health plans to pay for patients who stubbed their toes and went to emergency rooms for treatment such arguments infuriate doctors who specialize in emergency medicine and the treatment of pain dr joel r saper , director of the michigan head pain and neurological institute in ann arbor , said severe pain can be a sign of serious lifethreatening illness abdominal pain can be a sign of acute appendicitis severe head or neck ache can signal a hemorrhage in the brain severe back pain can be an early warning signal of an abdominal aneurysm or cancer of the pancreas thus , dr saper said medicare hmo s should not be allowed to deny coverage for emergencyroom visits by patients in severe pain based on the eventual diagnosis patients cannot make this distinction prior to a physician evaluation dr andrew t nathanson , an emergencycare doctor at rhode island hospital in providence , said i frequently evaluate patients having a major heart attack or pulmonary embolism or collapsed lung whose only symptom is chest pain other patients with similar symptoms have benign conditions but the patients and , many times , the doctors do n't know the cause until a thorough evaluation is performed if it s one of the benign conditions , insurance companies may retrospectively deny payment , saying the person s condition was obviously not an emergency but that was n't obvious at all when the patient first showed up under a 1986 federal law , a hospital has to provide a diagnostic examination and treatment to stabilize the condition of any patient who requests care in its emergency room the law explicitly mentions severe pain as a symptom of an emergency medical condition but mr graham said , current law allows medicare hmo s to deny payment for emergency services that the hospital must provide his bill is intended to eliminate that disparity by establishing a uniform standard for treatment and payment since december , the american association of health plans has issued six policy statements to show its commitment to putting patients first hmo officials have said the statements are intended to address consumers' concerns and to head off federal and state legislation dr joanne wilkinson , coordinator of emergency services at harvard pilgrim health care , an hmo with more than one million members in new england , agreed that a person in severe pain should have access to immediate care but in a letter to senator chafee , dr wilkinson wrote the unacceptable concept is that these services must be reimbursed in emergency rooms if a person chooses to be present there many of the symptoms covered in the language of the bill eg , low back pain , migraine headaches , urinary tract infections and sprains represent conditions which can be adequately cared for outside of a hospital setting with far less cost in her letter , dr wilkinson said the american college of emergency physicians was using emotional anecdotes to win support for senator graham s proposal
washington , feb 9 it is always comforting to find a villain in a story of organizational failure and the internal revenue service s computer modernization debacle presents a ready candidate richard m nixon in the mid1970 s , with the wounds of president nixon s attempted subversion of the agency still raw , congress was given a choice of what kind of irs it wanted huge , powerful and efficient , or huge , powerful and inept fearful that a tax collection agency with advanced computers could easily be turned into an instrument of oppression , lawmakers chose the latter congress cut funds for a proposed irswide automation program and forced the agency to make do with systems designed in the vacuumtube , punchcard era of the late 1950 s that decision , which left the irs with obsolescent computer systems and no master plan for coping with the explosive growth in tax return volume in the 1980 s and 1990 s , is at the root of the agency s current 4 billion computer modernization fiasco congressional auditors disclosed recently that the agency spent nearly that much in often ineffectual efforts to upgrade the system but blaming mr nixon alone is far too easy , according to outside experts and former irs officials the irs itself with its culture of secrecy , its misplaced faith in its own expertise and its inability to sharply define its mission bears by far the biggest share of responsibility , the experts said a succession of senior agency executives made a series of blunders , and when the failures became clear , responded by throwing more money at them the real problem was whenever there was a fork in the road , the irs decided to take both , said shelley l davis , a former agency historian who has just published a scathing book about the irs , unbridled power arthur a gross , a former new york state tax official recently appointed to try to untangle the irs s modernization efforts , told the commission in late january that many of the agency s computers were dysfunctional and that few of its 50 computer systems could communicate with each other and he acknowledged what many insiders and outside auditors have been saying for years the irs lacks the brainpower to fix the problem itself and must bring in experts from industry it is but the latest chapter in the chronicle of bureaucratic ineptitude that spans three decades a dozen irs commissioners have come and gone in the period and none has been able to get a handle on the problem of harnessing rapidly evolving automation technology to the accelerating flow of information into and out of the agency congress , too , bears some blame for the crisis , lurching from laxity to micromanagement and back again irs officials offer only a halfhearted defense not all of the 34 billion spent on computer upgrades over the past decade was wasted , they insist and nobody said that automating the annual processing of more than 200 million tax returns and collecting 14 trillion would be easy it s indisputable that we were trying to put too many discrete projects across the goal line in too short a time , said the irs deputy commissioner , michael p dolan , the agency s highestranking career official we 're clearly going to be taking a more targeted , more incremental approach as we move forward the deluge data processing for the masses the role of the internal revenue service as the nation s tax collector is , of course , unique but the data processing requirements are for the most part familiar the agency must input data and store it , then , as needed , retrieve and manipulate that information those tasks have changed little since 1958 , when the agency designed its first automation system and the agency still processes data much as it did when its first computer system became fully operational in 1965 thousands of clerks still use their hands and their keyboards to enter data from millions of individual and corporate tax returns into the system as the volume of these returns has doubled in the last 30 years to more than 206 million today the irs has responded by hiring more temporary workers during tax filing season meanwhile , private industries with similar volumes of data to process banks , insurance companies , credit card companies have modernized , eliminating much of the manual drudgery and developing or purchasing systems that allow them to gain access to customer records with a few keystrokes at the same time , the irs is losing billions of dollars in revenue each year because its computer networks often cannot match an individual s reports of income from various sources with the parallel reports filed by the businesses that paid him the money modernizing these systems and linking them is the goal of the current multibilliondollar effort but the agency is operating under a number of constraints that do not exist in the private sector no other institution handles the sheer volume of paper forms or must cope with the april 15 deluge
a tart unparalleled was how one critic described her in 1973 , further observing that she shouts like an alley cat and has the manners of a gangster s moll another reviewer , noting her tendency to beat up on those closest to her , thought she might be the reigning welterweight champion of alexandria for a third , adjectives like shrill , harsh and acrid sprang to mind but fellows , if you could only see her now twentyfour years after presenting shakespeare s cleopatra \( in tony richardson s london production \) as an imperious , untamable shrew , vanessa redgrave has apparently decided that the serpent of the nile is a venomless creature judging from the new interpretation of antony and cleopatra , which opened last night at the joseph papp public theater with ms redgrave as its star and director , age may not wither this most capricious of monarchs , but it can certainly sweeten her think of it , perhaps , as i love cleo a portrait of an amiably dizzy , redheaded and not terribly intelligent queen who does some wacky things \( like pretending to be dead and throwing shoes at messengers \) , but only in the name of romance cleo may not be big on logic or an even temper , but she s as loyal as can be to that big lug , marc antony indeed , the subtitle of this jawdroppingly bizarre production might as well be stand by your man whence cometh this transformation from virago to addled helpmate \? ms redgrave , arguably the greatest living actress of the englishspeaking theater , has had a long time to think about cleopatra since she first took on the role , deafening the critics of london with her screeches in the richardson production in 1986 , again in london , she played opposite timothy dalton as a cleopatra variously described as a volatile , witty sensualist and an eccentric bluestocking her current incarnation dates to the 1995 production she directed for london s leftminded moving theater , which she founded with her brother , corin , expressly to emphasize the historical and political relevance of drama a version of that interpretation made its way last year to the alley theater in houston when i saw it , it was pretty much of a muddle , with ms redgrave doing a passive , oddly egalitarianseeming cleopatra , offering little but the queen s death scene , which she performed stunningly , to induce appreciative shivers now ms redgrave has further refined , if that is the word , her take on the play for the new york shakespeare festival while she has retained her antony \( david harewood \) and her enobarbus \( the likable alex allen morris \) from the alley production , she is also now working with a host of festival reliables \( stephen skybell and peter francis james , among others \) and she has clearly taken more than a page from the makeshakespearefun manual of the public theater the results are definitely livelier than what was seen in houston , with a cast that at least seems to be enjoying itself the effect is also , however , even more joltingly eclectic whereas before ms redgrave straddled two eras for her antony , that in which it is set and that in which it was written , the production has now become a millenniumencompassing heap of cultural baggage in the timehonored public theater tradition of doing shakespeare , there are sirens , searchlights and contemporary weapons \( with the evocation of a helicopter \) for the war scenes uniforms \( by ann houldward \) that mix elizabethan codpieces with latterday khaki , and video projections and batteries of microphones for the political speeches there are also such whimsical touches as a wanted poster featuring antony \( after his rupture with caesar \) , propaganda fliers \( distributed to the front row of the audience \) in latin and a fax that appears to be written in hieroglyphics and this may be the first englishspeaking antony of record in which a soldier says , buenas noches , senor amid the mtvstyle flash can be discerned \( although you have to look hard \) ms redgrave s central thesis that antony and cleopatra is shakespeare s coded elegy to the end of renaissance humanism and roman catholicism in england just when a more repressive and puritanical political spirit was coming to power john arnone s set , therefore , in addition to the usual scaffolding and platforms habitually provided for shakespeare at the public , offers a crackedfresco backdrop showing botticelli s venus as a madonna \( do n't ask \) there are weightylooking books with gilt titles in latin piled about the stage \( presumably to suggest the library at alexandria , although dante is also included \) and there is throughout the production a counterpoint of latin chants and hymns , sung in cleopatra s court , and the more vigorous protestant prayers and church songs , usually led by antony s nemesis , octavius caesar \( played as a petulant puritan boyking by the actress carrie preston , in one of the season s wittiest drag performances \) in an interview with the actress and playwright ellen mclaughlin in the public s edition of stagebill , ms redgrave said she saw antony \( an extraordinary michelangelo figure \) and cleopatra as a renaissance couple who glory in the life of the body and the powers of man s mind they have renounced warfare at the play s beginning , she contends , for a more idyllic life that , alas , cannot be sustained in a bellicose age
the year has just begun , but it s safe to predict that the museum of modern art s rainer werner fassbinder retrospective , opening thursday night and running through march 20 , will be remembered as one of the most exhilarating cinema events of 1997 the films of this prodigiously talented and prolific german director , the man who made the masterly marriage of maria braun and berlin alexanderplatz , can be easily appreciated as separate entities when seen at random and out of chronological order which is the way they began to arrive in this country in the late 1960 s yet to get some measure of the heft of the work , and of the fearsome creative momentum of the mind behind it , you need a retrospective as relentlessly comprehensive and comparatively compact as this show each film informs and illuminates those that have gone before seen together , they reveal an astonishing selfportrait , as aggressively naked in its way as the lucian freud selfportrait that not long ago so alarmed and intimidated critics in the art world fassbinder , who died in 1982 at the age of 36 , was not a nice man he was seductive , ruthless , brilliant and , though surrounded by people , always alone he could shower friends and associates with expensive presents one minute and ignore them the next , sometimes for years treated even worse were the male lovers , two of whom committed suicide the women tended to make humiliating compromises to remain in his circle he was a master of power games at the same time , he was as passionate and merciless a social satirist of west germany as george grosz had been of the postwar germany of the 1920 s and 1930 s his psychological profile is textbook complex an only child , the product of a broken marriage , fassbinder idolized his mother , liselotte eder , who , when he was a boy , had tried to turn him away from the arts to more manly pursuits instead , he transformed her into a motion picture actress , and a good one as he liked to say that he had always functioned as his own father , he effectively gave birth to his own mother , renamed lilo pempeit , who became one of the iconic figures of his cinema , along with hanna schygulla , irm hermann , margit carstensen , kurt raab , harry baer and gunther kaufmann , among others it was with this remarkable company of players that fassbinder was able to turn out 41 features and 3 shorts in what now appears to have been 17 years of white heat , which ended only with his death , apparently from heart failure he worked fast the marriage of maria braun was shot in 35 days berlin alexanderplatz , his epic television miniseries , took 154 days , but , running 15 1 2 hours , it is the equivalent of seven feature films though a tyrant himself , fassbinder always identified with victims while being furiously amused and fascinated by victimizers the opening titles of effi briest \( 1974 \) , his elegant blackandwhite adaptation of theodor fontane s classic 19thcentury novel , a dark comedy of manners , contains this note the many people who sense their own capabilities and needs , and acquiesce to the prevailing system , accept it in their minds and , by their deeds , they confirm and strengthen it the wellborn , naive effi , enchantingly played by ms schygulla , is destroyed by her conviction that her husband and society are right to condemn her for a completely innocent affair fassbinder was appalled by all systems he was especially scathing about the excesses he saw in the celebrated west german economic miracle of the 1950 s yet he was less outraged by any system than by those whose victimization certified the system and made it work he saw them as coconspirators and politics as a series of terminal , sadomasochistic relationships witness fox and his friends \( 1974 \) , about a nonetoobright but sweetnatured carnival freak \( played by fassbinder \) , who allows himself to be swindled out of his lottery winnings by his fancily mannered , haute bourgeois male lover nowhere is fassbinder more eloquent , more dazzling or more exuberant as both film maker and social satirist than in his two chefd'oeuvres the marriage of maria braun \( 1978 \) , in which ms schygulla plays fassbinder s postworld war ii variation on mother courage , and the gorgeous and haunting lola \( 1981 \) , in which barbara sukowa and armin muellerstahl update the blue angel to the period of the economic miracle enthusiastic coconspirators and victims all fassbinder understood better than any of his contemporaries that the cinematic equivalent to the voice of a playwright \( he began in the theater \) or a novelist is the camera he used it so distinctively that it has the effect of being a continuing , skeptical character throughout his films , though a character subject to contradictory moods romantic , sullen , selfabsorbed , cruel , amused , even high as a kite in katzelmacher , a grungy , spare 1969 drama about a group of munich street punks and their girlfriends , the camera has the manner of a kid who longs to join the gang it hangs around on the sidewalk , attending to all that s being said and done while pretending to be as bored and lazy as the nascently fascistic bigger guys when someone walks off screen , the camera does n't follow as you might expect with some selfconsciousness it remains rooted

john o pickett is chuckling these days he has discovered the joys of bad publicity despite a month of prominent national reports about john spano s allegedly fradulent attempt to buy the islanders , a dozen or so suitors have emerged , apparently willing to pay more than the 165 million spano promised all the publicity brought them out , pickett said yesterday but the negative publicity had nothing to do with the team no , it was about spano , an elusive figure who demonstrated how far you can go when gullible banks take you solely on your word so , spano awaits a possible federal indictment on bank and wire fraud charges on long island , and pickett is fielding avid offers of interest from groups and individuals all worth more than the 230 million fortune that spano claimed to possess when fleet bank lent him 80 million to buy the islanders and pickett is certain , very certain , that these potential buyers are legitimately rich a lot are well known , which makes it easy for us to check them out , he said most can be checked out through public documents some are listed on stock exchanges , some are on the forbes 400 we have individuals , we have groups , all substantial we could not be more pleased all the suitors pickett said , are from the new york area , save one from beverly hills he declined to identify any , but bob gutkowski , the president of the marquee group said i think our group would be one of the 12 or 13 in his prequalification process , pickett said , bidders have to fully identify themselves and their capabilities if he and his group deem that the suitors should proceed , they can check out the islanders' books added pickett i'm talking to gary bettman and he s assured me that he will be very thorough if you 've been burned , you overreact to avoid further embarrassment , you can bet that pickett and bettman , the national hockey league commissioner , will do everything , even check the lengths of bidders' trouser inseams , to guarantee a future free from spano imitators the league admits that spano fell through the cracks of its approval process , and may have to hire barnaby jones to caulk up those cracks spano was known to the hockey community because he had tried to buy the dallas stars and windowshopped the florida panthers beyond that , he was an alien still , too many people averred that spano was a fine financial fellow so fine that when spano signed a letter of intent to buy the islanders on aug 2 last year , pickett shooed away three or four qualified buyers but we chose spano , he said , chuckling , for his exceptional credentials we did n't want a bidding contest and went with spano those rejected suitors have rejoined the hunt for the team , he added and pickett expects the price tag to be substantially above spano s naturally , he would hope to boost the value of the team and its cable contract suddenly , it s a seller s market , and pickett believes he can get more but how could the islanders' value suddenly rise so quickly \? they did not win a stanley cup in the last month or sign mark messier toe blake did not become the head coach and nassau coliseum did not turn into camden yards yet since making the aug 2 deal last year which spun out of control after spano s failure to make a 17 million payment that was due on april 7 pickett points to several valueenhancing factors , saying a year ago , expansion was not quite a finished thing , and we estimated each team would go for 75 million a team but it s 80 million for four teams , and that means 12 million for each team in extra revenues last august , we had 16 years left on our sportschannel deal , but now it s been extended to 35 years the state has committed 30 million to build a new coliseum and so , pickett has learned that bad publicity , a sour deal , the arraignment of spano , and screaming headlines can be blessings in disguise it made everybody aware that the team was for sale , he said i expected some bottom fishing but we got none olbermann s big show keith olbermann is six weeks past departing espn s sportscenter , and preparing for the tentatively titled the big show , his new msnbc nightly program , which is scheduled to start during the week of sept 29 but he is also relishing his unexpected summer of sloth there s nothing better than having a tv job without having to be on tv , he said from the connecticut house he is gleefully selling in order to buy a manhattan apartment my intestines are ok and i work out twice a day he has watched all of 10 minutes of his old show during the planning of the new one , which will mix newsdriven interviews with , he said , lots of weird stuff , oddball stories , funny items and an occasional celebrity interview the name of the show evokes the nickname for sportscenter , and the name of the book olbermann wrote with dan patrick , his former espn partner if it sticks , it will be one last legacy to espn from a prodigal son
when executives at the general instrument corporation , a big maker of equipment for cable television systems , announced earlier this month that the company would split into three units by july , some investors heard echoes threeway breakup telecommunications company sounds familiar , but it is not att lucent technologies , the telecommunications star of the recent att breakup , soared in large part because it was no longer part of att loathing the idea of patronizing a competitor , the regional bell operating companies had , over the years , moved their business away from att as the company began to seek ways back into the local telephone market when att converted its systems unit into the independent lucent , the contracts returned none of the companies set to emerge from the general instrument breakup appear poised for any such windfall since the jan 7 announcement , general instrument s stock has risen 9 percent , closing friday at 24875 that is a pleasant bounce , but hardly the explosive leap some other stocks like pepsico last week have taken after spinoff announcements our expectation was n't that the announcement would cause a pop in the stock , said general instrument s chief executive , richard s friedland we 're setting the stage for growth the stage may be set , but many investors seem content to wait for the performance to begin general instrument , which is based in chicago and had 1995 revenue of 24 billion , is best known as the no 1 maker of the settop boxes used by today s cable tv systems it ships about six million of them each year the company is also trying to establish itself as the dominant maker of the settop boxes used by the cable tv systems of the future , and of advanced digital systems that will allow telephone companies to send video signals to their customers developing such products is expensive general instrument has relied for years on strong cash flows from its established , though smaller , coaxial cable and semiconductor operations to finance the research company executives are now confident that their new settop boxes are ready to carry the unit so , like a spacecraft jettisoning its booster rockets as it prepares to enter orbit , the company is spinning off those mature businesses each of the three new manufacturing companiestobe one making settop boxes and cable modems , one making coaxial and other cables and one making obscure types of semiconductors is among the leaders in its field but the market realizes that breaking one company into two , or three , or 10 does not necessarily give those new businesses a leg up in winning market share from the competition if you do n't have synergies between the businesses , a breakup makes sense , said nikos theodosopoulos , a financial analyst at ubs securities but it does n't take away the execution challenges before them steven d levy , a telecommunications equipment analyst at oppenheimer company in new york , said i'm basically neutral on gi stock when we did our breakup value and looked at the comparable companies , there was not a significant difference between how we would value the pieces today and the whole they still have a lot to prove the company also has a lot to explain it carries about 700 million in debt , and has not said exactly how it will apportion that liability though the company s director of financial relations , mark borman , said that the new semiconductor and cable companies , with their strong cash flows , could be expected to shoulder the lion s share the details of the reorganization have also not been disclosed mr friedland said each share of general instrument stock would probably be converted into one share of the settop box company , onehalf share of the cable company and onethird to onehalf share of the new semiconductor company the main reason for the breakup is to allow general instrument s systems hardware group to blossom as an independent company nextlevel systems nextlevel would retain mr friedland as chief executive the chicago headquarters of general instrument , and most , or about 175 billion , of the corporation s annual revenue nextlevel s competitors are trading at about 29 times their projected earnings for this year because general instrument is trading at about 18 times its expected 1997 earnings , the company hopes the market will price nextlevel at a higher multiple some analysts , however , caution that nextlevel may trade at a discount to its peer group because of its uncertain prospects , already reflected in general instrument s current share price its immediate future will depend on sales of advanced digital settop boxes , which allow cable tv operators to provide more channels and some interactive services mr friedland said the company expects to ship one million of the units this year , up from just 100 , 000 in 1996 so far , general instrument appears to be splitting that market about evenly with its longtime rival , scientificatlanta , said w john aronsohn , an analyst with the yankee group in boston
belfast , northern ireland , jan 13 the overwhelmingly roman catholic irish republican army has acknowledged that an increasing number of catholics in belfast have begun to inform on the guerrilla organization s planned violent attacks and has warned that it will punish such informers the ira acknowledgment and threat of reprisals on informers is extremely rare , say officials , experts and catholics who live in areas where for decades residents , many out of fear of violent punishment , have connived at ira guerrilla action whether or not they support it british officials confirmed today that the number of catholic informers was rising the officials said , without giving specific figures , that in recent weeks the informers have begun to telephone the police of the royal ulster constabulary to disclose information they have on violent operations being planned by the ira the police say they can tell that the informers live in catholic neighborhoods from the nature of their information on particular ira guerrillas already known to the authorities the information has helped thwart several bomb attacks here in the british province of ulster , police and other officials say last week , the ira , in another rare public statement , made it clear that it intended to continue its campaign of violence to end british sovereignty in predominantly protestant northern ireland more people are lifting the telephone , said an official in the northern ireland office , which administers the province they are voting with their fingers they 've prevented quite a lot of nasty incidents there is a tide running against the terrorists the officials pointed to the public warning to informers issued over the weekend by the ira , which acknowledged that informing was on the rise and threatened that its belfast brigade would take action against anyone placing the lives of our volunteers in danger politicians , experts and ordinary catholic residents of belfast said the reason for the rise is the ira s resumption of its campaign of violence in northern ireland , where people had enjoyed peace for more than two years after the ira and protestant paramilitaries declared ceasefires in 1994 the ira broke its 17month ceasefire last february with a series of bomb attacks in england but the increase in informers did not begin until the outlawed guerrilla organization began to attack again last autumn in northern ireland in october there was an ira bomb attack on the british army headquarters at lisburn , 10 miles south of belfast , which killed one army officer and wounded 30 people , some of them civilians but on new year s eve a planned bombing , with a van holding 1 , 000 pounds of explosives , of belfast castle , a restaurant and meeting hall run by the city council , was aborted , the police said , when they were called by an informer in recent weeks , other attacks have been prevented by informers calling the special telephone number that is painted on the ubiquitous police land rovers that patrol the city on friday the ira tied up traffic in belfast with about 20 hoax bomb warnings that kept the police and army troops rushing around none of the vehicles indicated by the hoaxers turned out to contain explosives , suggesting that the guerrillas were responding to decreasing support among catholics here one catholic resident said it was no secret in catholic nationalist areas that many catholics who once connived at ira violence were turning against it the resident said people in catholic neighborhoods usually knew the local ira operatives , and sometimes watched them load cars with weapons some catholics , the resident said , have begun not only to inform on the provies , as they are called , but to upbraid them in street encounters , saying things like i thought gerry adams was working for peace , referring to the president of sinn fein , the ira political wing the police said the informers' calls were numerous , but did not give a specific figure the increase in informing resulted in an official ira statement two days ago in the weekly newspaper anderstown news , published in a catholic area over the past number of weeks the belfast brigade of the ira has become aware that a number of people in the belfast area have compromised operations and placed the lives of volunteers in danger , the statement said it added , the belfast brigade will take action against anyone placing the lives of our volunteers in danger in this way david mckittrick , the author of several books on the northern ireland conflict and the correspondent here for the london independent , said the ira s statement meant the guerrillas felt that a message is being sent to them by the nationalist community that a lot of people who used to have tolerance of ira violence now disapprove of it city councilman jim rodgers said a lot of information is coming in from nationalist areas that was n't coming in before it s of a very high quality
albany , june 26 after six years of fierce opposition by south bronx residents , bronxlebanon hospital center agreed today to close down a towering medical waste incinerator that had routinely violated state pollution standards over the years and stirred charges of environmental racism against its owners under intense pressure from the pataki administration and fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president , the hospital announced that it would close the incinerator , situated at 138th street and locust avenue in the port morris industrial park , in the next 10 days hospital officials said they would use that time to find other ways to dispose of the approximately 60 , 000 pounds of waste they were burning at the plant each day the hospital is in the morrisania section , about two miles north of the plant it s a fantastic blessing , said carlos padilla , the executive director of the south bronx clean air coalition , which had used everything from candlelight vigils to lawsuits to push for the plant s closure the right thing has been done , finally the community was right state environmental officials said the plant , which has dual furnaces and matching 80foot smokestacks , had exceeded its permitted levels of carbon monoxide seven times during the first three weeks of june , once by 25 times the authorized amount carbon monoxide can cause respiratory problems , and many residents had blamed the plant for the area s aboveaverage rate of asthma the state has found the plant in violation of its permitted pollution levels several times since it was built in 1991 and has fined its owners at least once for noncompliance we 've been constantly working with them to comply , said gary sheffer , a spokesman for the state department of environmental conservation but they continued to emit beyond their permitted level today s announcement came after a flurry of bipartisan activity by politicians to close the plant on wednesday , opponents of the plant released an engineering study showing that the incinerator was emitting toxic chemicals into the atmosphere this morning , mr ferrer held a news conference outside the plant to demand its closing and by this afternoon , aides to gov george e pataki were negotiating with hospital officials to shut down the plant , which is owned by browningferris industries and operated in conjunction with the hospital center when browningferris resisisted , the governor asked attorney general dennis c vacco to begin court action to force its closing with that , the company agreed to shut the plant down voluntarily , the aides said opponents of the incinerator also said they had asked senator alfonse m d'amato , mr pataki s political mentor and the state s most powerful republican , to intervene with state officials last month , mr d'amato , who has low approval ratings in most polls and has been striving to improve his standing among environmentalists , sent letters to mr vacco and john p cahill , the state environmental commissioner , urging them to close the plant mr sheffer said mr d'amato s letters were no more influential than those sent by numerous other officials opposed to the plant this was part of our ongoing oversight of the facility , he said it was clear the situation was n't getting better it was only getting worse mr ferrer said of the closing , this is a culmination of a long battle by this community , which has been beleaguered by the greatest number of garbage treatment and disposal plants in the city in a statement , miguel a fuentes jr , chief executive of the hospital , said bronxlebanon will not tolerate the operation of an incinerator in a manner that violates any laws or regulations i fully endorse the measures taken by governor pataki to protect the wellbeing and safety of the community mr pataki said in a statement , i promised the people of the bronx that i would shut this facility down if it did not meet our tough environmental standards , and today i have kept that promise when it was opened in 1992 , the plant s owners called it an advanced solution to the growing problem of disposing of medical waste like bloody bandages and syringes costing 20 million , outfitted with modern pollutionscrubbing equipment and situated in a largely industrial neighborhood , the plant was designed to serve a dozen hospitals and clinics that had formerly been disposing of their waste in outmoded and much dirtier incinerators but before its furnaces were ever fired , residents were already charging that the plant was too close to a local public housing project and that they had not been adequately notified of its construction by late 1991 , while construction was under way , a coalition led by local officials , clergy members , residents and business owners had begun picketing the construction site and preparing lawsuits to block the plant s opening the opponents charged that the plant had been placed in their community because its owners had little regard for the mostly lowincome , minority residents there in part because of their protests , state legislators introduced bills in albany to prevent socalled environmental racism , though none has become law in 1995 , browningferris bought the incinerator from its previous owners , who had filed for bankruptcy protection , and invested more than 15 million in upgrading it but state officials said it continued to violate its pollution permits today s action is not necessarily the final chapter in the incinerator tale mr sheffer said he expected browningferris to apply to reopen it sometime in the future they 'll have to demonstrate that they are willing to meet the conditions of their permit , he said and we believe that will require them making a major investment in the facility photo bronxlebanon hospital center has agreed to close down a medical waste incinerator that burned about 60 , 000 pounds of waste each day \( norman y lono \) \( pg b5 \) map of the bronx

federal prosecutors in manhattan have subpoenaed documents related to a police insurance contract held by the wives of two police union lawyers who were indicted last week on racketeering charges , according to lawyers familiar with the case the two women , deborah m martz and linda a nunziato , run a partnership called deblin planners , which is the insurance agent for the patrolmen s benevolent association s life insurance program since 1989 , about 25 , 000 metropolitan life insurance policies have been sold to pba members , for which the insurance company pays deblin annual commissions , according to a spokesman for the insurance company ms martz is the wife of james j lysaght and ms nunziato is the wife of peter kramer , who are partners in the law firm of lysaght , lysaght and kramer , which represents the pba in a federal racketeering indictment filed last week , mr lysaght and mr kramer were charged with paying kickbacks to the former president of the transit police benevolent association , which the lysaght firm also represented none of the charges in the indictment are related to the lawyers' work for the city pba or to the insurance arrangement federal officials have said the investigation is continuing , and in recent months prosecutors have subpoenaed records from deblin planners , said a lawyer familiar with the investigation in addition , metropolitan life has turned over documents related to the pba insurance plan to investigators , according to someone familiar with information requested by federal officials calls to deblin yesterday were not answered nor were calls to lawyers for mr kramer gerald lefcourt , a lawyer representing the lysaghts , declined to comment laura brevetti , a lawyer for the pba , said the organization has no financial involvement in the insurance arrangement since commissions are paid by metropolitan life it was unclear yesterday whether federal investigators examining the subpoenaed documents were focusing specifically on the role of ms martz and ms nunziato but the history of the insurance arrangement shows the close relationship between the police union and the lysaght firm beginning in 1989 , the union s insurance agent was richard hartman , who was also indicted on racketeering charges last week mr hartman had been the pba s lawyer but gave up his law license in 1988 as part of an agreement with the manhattan district attorney s office , which was investigating him for using union money to pay personal gambling debts he was not charged in the case with mr hartman barred from practicing law , the pba s legal business was assumed by the lysaght firm , and mr hartman became the union s insurance agent , helping to arrange for the sale of metropolitan life policies to pba members according to papers filed in a civil suit brought against mr hartman by his former accountant , dennis j king , mr hartman was paid commissions of as much as 550 , 000 every three months in 1991 , according to mr king s lawsuit , mr hartman sold the rights to the pba business to deblin planners , which registered that year with the state as a life insurance agent jon goldstein , a spokesman with metropolitan life , said deblin became the broker of record on the pba account in 1994 mr goldstein declined to comment on commissions paid to deblin
to the editor re nynex captures the regulators \( editorial , aug 5 \) while you claim there is nearly no competition for local service , nynex is processing thousands of telephone lines bought by 25 competitors and resold to customers who had received local service from nynex this is in addition to the tens of thousands of customers served by 12 other companies competing against us in new york the question you should have asked is , why is it that 37 aggressive companies are competing here profitably when att and mci say that is impossible \? why is it that of the tens of thousands of lines resold by us to competitors , virtually none were bought by these two giants \? contrary to what you say , it is in nynex s best interests to promote local competition , to meet the federal checklist we must satisfy before we can enter the long distance business but it is in att s and mci s best interests to blame us for their failure to enter the local market to delay our entry into long distance , where we will give them vigorous competition your criticism of our service is misleading following our largescale investment , hiring and redeployment , customer service is at an alltime high the most recent government survey of network reliability places nynex at the top ivan seidenberg chairman and chief exec , nynex new york , aug 5 , 1997
farmingville , ny , june 19 when john becerra , a convicted sex offender , moved into his twostory home here in december 1995 , he had hoped to begin a new life with his wife and their 9yearold son but in march , he and his family found themselves the target of a persistent campaign of protests by their neighbors signs were put up around the neighborhood warning , beware of sex offender a brick was thrown through their car window rallies were held outside their home and calls , the becerras contend , were made to both of their employers now mr becerra and his wife , candice , are suing two of their formerly friendly neighbors for 10 million , accusing them of harassment in an effort to get the becerras to move elsewhere the becerra suit highlights the collision between two competing values the rights of parents to protect their children from potential abusers and the rights of sex offenders who have served their time to resume normal lives the suit is similar , in part , to several lawsuits filed in new jersey and other states challenging megan s laws , which require convicted sex offenders to register their addresses with the police when they are released from prison the laws also provide for notification of schools , community groups and even immediate neighbors in some cases mr becerra s crime preceded new york state s adoption of the law , and his neighbors learned of his conviction on their own nonetheless , lawyers for sex offenders say the law has increased awareness of sex crimes involving children and encourages harassment such harrassment , they say , constitutes another level of punishment for offenders who have already served their courtordered sentences in new jersey , a pending legal challenge by the office of public defender seeks to bar public notification , contending that the law is unconstitutional because it exposes parolees to vigilantism , harassment , job loss or reprisals and thus brings on undeserved punishment mr becerra s lawyer , martin i effman , who filed the suit in suffolk county supreme court , said mr becerra had pleaded guilty in february 1996 to four counts of sexual abuse and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child , had served four months of a sixmonth prison sentence and was meeting the conditions of a fiveyear probation he s is now entitled to live peacefully and quietly with his family in their own home in seclusion and solitude , mr effman said none of the becerras' neighbors were aware , at least until a few months ago , that mr becerra , 45 , was a convicted sex offender they tracked down his record in suffolk county criminal court after hearing a rumor they declined to say how they first heard the rumor they said they were shocked to learn that mr becerra had been convicted of crimes involving young children near his previous home in bellport only a few miles away we were very frightened for our children s safety , said lucy bukowski , who lives a few doors away from the becerras with her husband and two young daughters we 've been told that nearly 80 percent of all sex offenders are repeat offenders , and that s a basis for rational fear , she said another of the neighbors being sued , dolores ferraro , said she has three daughters and they are all frightened yes , we feel concern for his wife and 9yearold son , but the safety of our own children must come first , mrs ferraro said it could be that john becerra may never do anything wrong again , but we ca n't take that chance we remember what happened in new jersey to megan megan kanka was 7 years old when she was raped and strangled by a convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her home in new jersey a jury found jesse k timmendequas guilty of murder and began deliberating today whether he should be put to death megan kanka s case led to the enactment of laws in nearly all the states requiring sex offenders to register with local authorities new york s version of the law went into effect on jan 21 , 1996 , and required the local police to make public the names of convicted sex offenders however , a federal court has barred the state from releasing information on offenders , such as mr becerra , who committed their crimes before the law took effect they are still required to register periodically with the local police the becerras claim that mrs burkowski and mrs ferraro have been conducting a campaign to intimidate , malign and otherwise severely injure him and his family the becerras also accuse them of making threatening and obnoxious telephone calls to their home and to their employers of causing people to trespass on their property of harassing people coming to and leaving their property , and shouting obscene and threatening language the becerras claim that the plaintiffs encouraged others to throw a brick that smashed a window in their car and a bb shot that pierced a window in their house both mrs bukowski and mrs ferraro denied throwing bricks or damaging the becerras' property , though they admit that they have held rallies and carried signs we are lawabiding citizens , mrs bukowski said he is the one who broke the law and brought shame and humiliation on himself , yet we 're the ones being summoned to appear in court what he is doing is outrageous , she said he is attacking our first amendment rights of free speech and assembly and if he is successful , other sex offenders all across the country will be using the same tactic in an effort to silence and intimidate their neighbors it s just another form of abuse mrs bukowski s lawyer , donnie j sallah , filed a response to the suit today , asking the court to dismiss the complaint based on the argument that it failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted despite the filing of the becerra lawsuit , the protests have continued and we plan to keep on doing it mrs bukowski said after a peaceful demonstration monday evening in front of the becerra home photo in farmingville , ny , neighbors gathered on monday to protest outside the home of john becerra , a convicted sex offender mr becerra and his wife are suing

hello , ottawa \? maybe if smith sends some money along , he can move robitaille for a younger , hungrier prospect with more of an upside and speaking of trades if smith could trade robitaille and ulf samuelsson back to pittsburgh for petr nedved and sergei zubov , would he reverse the deal he made before the 199596 season \? you remember nedved and zubov they were campbell s frequent scapegoats in his first season as ranger coach nedved now has 26 goals , more than any ranger except mark messier zubov , now with dallas , has 11 goals , more than any ranger defenseman except brian leetch should campbell himself be a scapegoat \? some fans think so they say a team with highend talent like that of the rangers should seem more motivated than the rangers sometimes seem again , campbell gets the benefit of the doubt here on a roster with messier and wayne gretzky , any coach would be almost irrelevant besides , the most motivated teams are those with a nucleus of young players , on the way up , with nothing yet won , with something to prove in their careers and with their big earning years still ahead you see it on teams such as the flyers and the sabres you do not see it on the rangers despite his occasional bumping matches with opposing coaches and casually caustic comments about the state of new jersey , campbell may be the best fit for the limited authority that goes with the linechanging role at madison square garden he and smith must mix and match players to suit the talents and personalities of messier and gretzky the current buzz suggests smith should get boston s rick tocchet before the march 18 deadline but do the rangers really need another expensive veteran with questionable durability and lots of opinions \? certainly , the rangers prefer older players even the latest rookie , jeff nielsen , is 25 years old they have picked up the veterans david oliver from edmonton , patrick flatley from the islanders and mike eastwood from phoenix while basically ignoring their own young , high draft choices , such as peter ferraro , christian dube and daniel goneau smith s staff scouted and selected these players whose fault is it that none fits on a team that lacks speed , enthusiasm and , lately , scoring power \? the rangers have but 10 goals in their last seven games should smith trade these youngsters for tocchet or some other veteran \? smith s last big trade came last spring , when he sent ray ferraro , ian laperriere , mattias norstrom and nathan lafayette , along with a draft choice , to los angeles for shane churla , marty mcsorley and jari kurri only churla remains , and he seems to get injured every time he fights so should smith be the scapegoat \? that is hard to say perhaps he sold his soul to mike keenan , his coach , when he traded mike gartner to toronto and tony amonte to chicago and todd marchant to edmonton just before the trading deadline in march 1994 the common wisdom around town is that those deals clinched the stanley cup by bringing glenn anderson , brian noonan , stephane matteau and craig mactavish to new york but maybe the rangers would have won the cup without those moves certainly they would be better today with gartner , amonte and marchant when asked yesterday if the rangers were about where he expected them to be at this point in the season , smith replied that is n't even something i could answer we 're certainly not overachieving when asked to sum up all the negative questions being raised about the rangers , he said people are looking that s what happens in new york when you lose for a week in his comments , smith also said he felt the team s younger players were indeed getting a chance this season and that he did not believe that messier and gretzky , both 36 , might be breaking down physically still , any objective observer has to notice that messier seems to get injured every season about this time and that gretzky , with one goal in his last 23 games , seems thin , occasionally weary and stoppable gretzky has rarely carried the puck to the net lately , and opposing teams are sneaking behind him to steal it off his stick when he curls around at the blue line this happened sunday night , when the flyers scored the winning goal after picking gretzky s pocket at the end of his unusually long , 1minute15second shift imagine if this had happened to robitaille , nedved , zubov or even the injured aleksei kovalev ! what would the coach have said or done to him \? campbell was wise not to single gretzky out for blame scapegoating is often unfair , and is especially counterproductive , when your team , over all , top to bottom , is just not good enough photos colin campbell s rangers have showed they can beat good teams and lose to bad teams in the past seven games , they have not defeated anybody \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg b17 \) rangers captian mark messier during a game last week against new jersey messier s slump has mirrored the team s \( bernie nunez for the new york times \)

if a bacon cheeseburger sounds tasty but unhealthy , how about a burger garnished with fishbased food product that resembles fried bacon pieces \? it should taste like bacon , too , under a patent awarded to a juneau , alaska , inventor , duff w mitchell food patents are only a small portion of the thousands of patents issued each year in the last decade , an increasing number have been for inventions that reduce fat , cholesterol or calories in foods that have the worst health images , like chocolate , cheese or meat some of the country s biggest and most wellknown food manufacturers receive new patents every month as they vie to capture a growing consumer market for lowfat , lowcalorie and hearthealthy foods sweeping new inventions like the controversial fat substitute , olestra , are only a small part of this research , however many more patents cover processes for squeezing an unwanted element out of an ordinary food , or for replacing a toorich food with a more benign ingredient and then dressing it up to look , smell , feel and taste like the real thing bacon is certainly high on the list of foods many people believe they should avoid it starts out bad little meat and lots of fat and gets worse fried in its own oil mr mitchell has come up with a process for using salmon and spices to create and cook fake bacon a salmon \( alaskan pink or chum , mr mitchell recommends \) is headed , gutted and boned the meat is deep skinned , so that none of the fish s skin or fat remains this meat is ground into a paste and mixed with salt , water and spices intended to mask the fish flavor they include garlic , soy sauce , citric acid and white pepper dehydrated spices are used to keep the mix from becoming too wet , and brown sugar is added as a food coloring and sweetener the paste is spread in thin sheets on a tray and heated and dehydrated in a smokehouse until dried each sheet is chopped into tiny pieces , then shredded again while being heated finally , the pieces are tossed with canola or another oil and smoke powder the powder not only enhances the smoked meat flavor of the chips , but turns them a color more appropriate to the appearance of real fried bacon mr mitchell says his salmonbased bacon bits have no nitrates he received patent 5 , 601 , 864 turning nuts into healthier nuts nuts also rank high in fats and calories yet they are so easy to eat by the handful or in foods like peanut butter totally fatfree nuts would probably sell well , but it s hard to imagine how to create them without breaking down or grinding up the nut in the meantime , denise zook , who works in new jersey for nabisco inc , has won a patent for a lowcalorie , lowfat nut peanuts , walnuts , pecans , brazil nuts , cashews and almonds are all options , whole or in pieces ms zook starts by removing some of the nuts' excess oil the nuts are pressed until oil oozes out , and then soaked in water until their size and shape is restored just removing this oil \( which is digestible triglyceride fats \) substantially cuts calories the nuts are subjected to a vacuum and then soaked in an edible oil and dye the ratio of this mix , ms zook says , should be from 2 to 15 percent of the weight of the nuts that way , the amount of oil mix that the nuts absorb can be controlled to keep calories low while restoring the nuts' taste and texture the edible coloring is intended to give the nuts the right hue after the soaking , the nuts are subjected to pressure of at least 10 pounds per square inch they are allowed to sit for about an hour and then roasted ms zook received patent 5 , 595 , 780 patented mistletoe , as a medicine mistletoe is better known for inspiring christmastime kissing than as an edible garnish but it is an herb , and patents for herbs are rare a university of southern california researcher has won two patents that may be the first to confer ownership to an herb as a medicine the patents cover the use of extracts of korean and european mistletoe to treat diseases in which the immune system is suppressed chief among them , aids and cancer extracts of specific amounts of lectins , viscotoxins and alkaloidal compounds in the mistletoe seem to bolster a patient s immune system the patents are based on a process known as bioprinting , which allows scientists to isolate an herb s active ingredients , determine the best combinations of those ingredients for use as a drug , and then set measurements so that dosages are precise and consistent as with any drug , mistletoe extract as an herbal remedy must pass muster with the food and drug administration tasneem a khwaga won patents 5 , 547 , 674 and 5 , 656 , 200 for extracts from the two kinds of mistletoe patents are available by number for 3 from the patent and trademark office , washington , dc 20231
